Bentzley, Eleanor J. Cole, Claudia Tischler, Katy H. Stimpson, Dalton Duvio, James H. Bishop, Danielle D. DeSouza, Alan Schatzberg, Corey Keller, Keith D. Sudheimer, Nolan R. Williams",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/672154 ,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent and debilitating, and development of improved treatments is limited by insufficient understanding of the neurological changes associated with disease remission. In turn, efforts to elucidate these changes have been challenging due to disease heterogeneity as well as limited effectiveness, delayed onset, and significant off-target effects of treatments. We developed a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) that in an open-label study was associated with remission from MDD in 90% of individuals in 1-5 days (Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, SAINT). This provides a tool to begin exploring the functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with MDD remission. Resting-state fMRI scans were performed before and after SAINT in 18 participants with moderate-to-severe, treatment-resistant MDD. FC was determined between regions of interest defined a priori by well-described roles in emotion regulation. Following SAINT, FC was significantly decreased between subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC) and 3 of 4 default mode network (DMN) nodes. Significant reductions in FC were also observed between the following: DLPFC-striatum, DLPFC-amygdala, DMN-amygdala, DMN-striatum, and amygdala-striatum. Greater clinical improvements were correlated with larger decreases in FC between DLPFC-amygdala and DLPFC-insula, as well as smaller decreases in FC between sgACC-DMN. Greater clinical improvements were correlated with lower baseline FC between DMN-DLPFC, DMN-striatum, and DMN-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The multiple, significant reductions in FC we observed following SAINT and remission from depression support the hypothesis that MDD is a state of hyper-connectivity within these networks, and rapid decoupling of network nodes may lead to rapid remission from depression.Significance statement Major depressive disorder is common and debilitating. It has been difficult to study the brain changes associated with recovery from depression, because treatments take weeks-to-months to become effective, and symptoms fail to resolve in many people. We recently developed a type of magnetic brain stimulation called SAINT. SAINT leads to full remission from depression in 90% of people within 5 days. We used SAINT and functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine how the brain changes with rapid remission from depression. We found changes in areas of the brain associated with emotion regulation. This provides a significantly clearer picture of how the non-depressed brain differs from the depressed brain, which can be used to develop rapid and effective treatments for depression.",15464,1318,2309,35
1,Identifying Severe Stroke Patients Likely to Benefit From Thrombectomy Despite Delays of up to a Day,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526947v2,"R. Gilberto González, Gisele Sampaio Silva, Julian He, Saloomeh Sadaghiani, Ona Wu, Aneesh B. Singhal",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/526947 ,"Selected patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) can benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after onset. Identifying patients who might benefit from late intervention after transfer from community hospitals to thrombectomy-capable centers would be valuable. We searched for presentation biomarkers to identify such patients. Frequent MR imaging over 2 days of 38 untreated LVO patients revealed logarithmic growth of the ischemic infarct core. In 24 patients with terminal internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions we found that an infarct core growth rate (IGR) &lt;4.1 ml/hr and initial infarct core volumes (ICV) &lt;19.9 ml had accuracies &gt;89% for identifying patients who would still have a core of &lt;50ml 24 hours after stroke onset, a core size that should predict favorable outcomes with thrombectomy. Published reports indicate that up to half of all LVO stroke patients have an IGR&lt;4.1 ml/hr. Other potentially useful biomarkers include the NIHSS and the perfusion measurements MTT and Tmax. We conclude that many LVO patients have a stroke physiology that is favorable for late intervention, and that there are biomarkers that can accurately identify them at early time points as suitable for transfer for intervention.",11838,626,1496,19

DeVito, Seb Bacon, Ben Goldacre",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/266452 ,"Introduction Non-publication of clinical trials results is an ongoing issue. In 2016 the US government updated the results reporting requirements to ClinicalTrials.gov for trials covered under the FDA Amendments Act 2007. We set out to develop and deliver an online tool which publicly monitors compliance with these reporting requirements, facilitates open public audit, and promotes accountability.Methods We conducted a review of the relevant legislation to extract the requirements on reporting results. Specific areas of the statutes were operationalized in code based on the results of our policy review, publicly available data from ClinicalTrials.gov, and communications with ClinicalTrials.gov staff. We developed methods to identify trials required to report results, using publicly available registry data; to incorporate additional relevant information such as key dates and trial sponsors; and to determine when each trial became due. This data was then used to construct a live tracking website.Results There were a number of administrative and technical hurdles to successful operationalization of our tracker. Decisions and assumptions related to overcoming these issues are detailed along with clarifications directly from ClinicalTrials.gov. The FDAAA TrialsTracker was successfully launched in February 2018 and provides users with an overview of results reporting compliance.Discussion Clinical trials continue to go unreported despite numerous guidelines, commitments, and legal frameworks intended to address this issue. In the absence of formal sanctions from the FDA and others, we argue tools such as ours - providing live data on trial reporting - can improve accountability and performance. In addition, our service helps sponsors identify their own individual trials that have not yet reported results: we therefore offer positive practical support for sponsors who wish to ensure that all their completed trials have reported.",19465,1294,4753,29
3,Effects of daily L-dopa administration on learning and brain structure in older adults undergoing cognitive training: a randomised clinical trial,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/482679v3,"Alexander V. Lebedev, Jonna Nilsson, Joanna Lindström, William Fredborg, Ulrika Akenine, Carolina Hillilä, Pia Andersen, Gabriela Spulber, Elizabeth CM de Lange, Dirk-Jan van den Berg, Miia Kivipelto, Martin Lövdén",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/482679 ,"Cognitive aging creates major individual and societal burden, motivating search for treatment and preventive care strategies. Behavioural interventions can improve cognitive performance in older age, but effects are small. Basic research has implicated dopaminergic signaling in plasticity. We investigated whether transient enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission via administration of L-dopa improves effects of cognitive training on performance.Sixty-three participants for this randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were recruited via newspaper advertisements. Inclusion criteria were: age of 65-75 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score &gt;25, absence of serious medical conditions. Eligible subjects were randomly allocated to either receive 100/25mg L-dopa/benserazide (n=32) or placebo (n=31) prior to each of twenty cognitive training sessions administered during a four-week period. Participants and staff were blinded to group assignment. Primary outcomes were latent variables of spatial and verbal fluid intelligence.Compared to the placebo group, subjects receiving L-dopa improved less in spatial intelligence (−0.267 SDs; 95%CI [−0.498, −0.036]; p=0.024). Change in verbal intelligence did not significantly differ between the groups (−0.081 SDs, 95%CI [−0.242, 0.080]; p=0.323). Subjects receiving L-dopa also progressed slower through the training and the groups displayed differential volumetric changes in the midbrain. Adverse events occurred for 10 (31%) and 7 (23%) participants in the active and control groups, correspondingly. No statistically significant differences were found for the secondary cognitive outcomes.The results speak against early pharmacological interventions in older healthy adults to improve broader cognitive functions by targeting the dopaminergic system and provide no support for learning-enhancing properties of L-dopa supplements. The findings warrant closer investigation about the cognitive effects of early dopamine-replacement therapy in neurological disorders. This trial was preregistered at the European Clinical Trial Registry, EudraCT#2016-000891-54.Significance The results put constraints on the hypothesis of a key role of the deteriorated dopaminergic system in age-related decline of learning abilities, and speak against early pharmacological interventions in older healthy adults to improve cognitive functions by targeting the dopaminergic system. Our findings also raise concerns about usefulness of novel L-dopa-containing supplements that claim to have neuroprotective and learning-enhancing properties, and present an urgent need to carefully investigate the cognitive outcomes of early pro-dopaminergic interventions in clinical populations often receiving substantially larger doses of L-dopa.",9317,646,2141,21

Sudheimer, Nolan R. Williams",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581280 ,"Background Current treatments for depression are limited by suboptimal efficacy, delayed response, and frequent side effects. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment that is FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recent methodological advancements suggest iTBS could be improved through 1) treating with multiple sessions per day at optimally-spaced intervals, 2) applying a higher overall pulse-dose of stimulation and 3) precision targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) circuit. We examined the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of an accelerated, high-dose, resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)-guided iTBS protocol for TRD termed ‘Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT)’.Methods Twenty-one participants with TRD received open-label SAINT. FcMRI was used to individually target the region of L-DLPFC most anticorrelated with sgACC. Fifty iTBS sessions (1800 pulses per session, 50-minute inter-session interval) were delivered as 10 daily sessions over 5 consecutive days at 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth). Neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after SAINT.Results Nineteen of 21 participants (90.48%) met criteria for remission (≤10 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) immediately after SAINT. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no negative cognitive side-effects. There were no seizures or other severe adverse events.Discussion Our accelerated, high-dose, iTBS protocol with fcMRI-guided targeting (SAINT) was well tolerated and safe. Efficacy was strikingly high, especially for this treatment-resistant population. Double-blinded sham-controlled trials are required to confirm the high remission rate found in this initial study.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03240692",14496,5341,3609,36

To elucidate the extent and principles of microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment, we conducted an interventional prospective cohort study. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11, and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification, S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples of the participants were collected along with their clinical metadata. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy people were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent natural microbiota shifts during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing.We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (&gt; 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC &gt; 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as the most contributive factors for prediction accuracy.",7785,848,1304,37

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in rodents. We aimed to establish whether oral NR supplementation in aged participants can increase the skeletal muscle NAD+ metabolome, and questioned if tissue NAD+ levels are depressed with aging. We supplemented 12 aged men with NR 1g per day for 21-days in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Targeted metabolomics showed that NR elevated the muscle NAD+ metabolome, evident by increased nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide clearance products. Muscle RNA sequencing revealed NR-mediated downregulation of energy metabolism and mitochondria pathways. NR also depressed levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. In an additional study, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based NAD+ measurement in muscle and brain showed no difference between young and aged individuals. Our data establish that oral NR is available to aged human muscle and identify anti-inflammatory effects of NR, while suggesting that NAD+ decline is not associated with chronological aging per se in human muscle or brain.",13142,5459,3157,61

Female subjects over 18-years-old affected by recurrent BV were included. The latest episode was diagnosed by Amsel criteria 6-9 days before the start of the study and treated with vaginal metronidazole (gel 0.75% mg for 5 days or ovules 500 mg for 7 days). The recurrence was defined by at least 2 episodes in the previous 12 months. Polybactum® vaginal ovules, day 1-4-7, were started within the 12th and the 24th hr after the end of metronidazole therapy and repeated monthly for 3 cycles.The first 41 patients enrolled were evaluated for an interim analysis 6 months after the study started; 2 patients interrupted the trial, leaving 39 evaluable subjects. The recurrence rate was significantly reduced compared to previous published data (10.26% vs 40% p&lt;0.001). In 35 patients without recurrence, the assessment of Lactobacillus vaginal flora performed by phase contrast microscopy evidenced a significant improvement form baseline (p=0.022) The Investigator global assessment of tolerability was excellent in 38 out of 39 cases.IMPORTANCE Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of childbearing age. In BV, Lactobacillus species, which are predominant in a healthy vaginal flora, are replaced by anaerobes, mainly Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is responsible for more than 60% of vulvovaginal infections and has been linked to serious, potentially life-threatening conditions, including: pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative infections, acquisition and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, preterm birth, and several adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our research showed that 3 monthly cycles of Polybactum® ovules administered after one course of metronidazole vaginal therapy can reduce the rate of Bacterial vaginosis recurrence and improve the vaginal milieu, favouring the growth of vaginal lactobacillus species. Taken together our results confirm that Polibactum® is a safe and effective treatment to reduce BV recurrence rate after a first line therapy with metronidazole.",9415,553,1564,24

Prim, Sangtae Ahn, Maria I. Davila, Morgan L. Alexander, Karen L. McCulloch, Flavio Fröhlich",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/668541 ,"Background Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is characterized by an alteration in pain processing by the central nervous system that may affect autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance. Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic ANS activation. In particular, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) solely reflects parasympathetic input and is reduced in CLBP patients. Yet, it remains unknown if non-invasive brain stimulation can alter ANS balance in CLBP patients.Objective To evaluate if non-invasive brain stimulation modulates the ANS, we analyzed HRV metrics collected in a previously published study of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for the modulation of CLBP through enhancing alpha oscillations. We hypothesized that tACS would increase RSA.Methods A randomized, crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study was conducted to investigate the effects of 10Hz-tACS on metrics of ANS balance calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG data were collected for 2 minutes before and after 40 minutes of 10Hz-tACS or sham stimulation.Results There were no significant changes in RSA or other frequency-domain HRV components from 10Hz-tACS. However, exploratory time-domain HRV analysis revealed a significant increase in the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN) for 10Hz-tACS relative to sham.Conclusion(s) Although tACS did not significantly increase RSA, we found in an exploratory analysis that tACS modulated an integrated HRV measure of both ANS branches. These findings support the further study of how the ANS and alpha oscillations interact and are modulated by tACS.",9180,549,1382,33

Intuitively, the exposed location at the epithelial surface qualifies these tumor types for utilization of visual aids to assist in discriminating tumor from healthy surrounding tissue. Here, we explored the DNA repair enzyme PARP1 as imaging biomarker and conducted optical imaging in animal models, human tissues and as part of a first-in-human clinical trial. Our data suggests that PARP1 is a quantitative biomarker for oral, oropharyngeal, and esophageal cancer and can be visualized with PARPi-FL, a fluorescently labeled small molecule contrast agent for topical or intravenous delivery. We show feasibility of PARPi-FL-assisted tumor detection in esophageal cancer, oropharyngeal and oral cancer. We developed a contemporaneous PARPi-FL topical staining protocol for human biospecimens. Using fresh oral cancer tissues within 25 min of biopsy, tumor and margin samples were correctly identified with &gt;95% sensitivity and specificity without terminal processing. PARPi-FL imaging can be integrated into clinical workflows, potentially providing instantaneous assessment of the presence or absence of microscopic disease at the surgical margin. Additionally, we showed first-in-human PARPi-FL imaging in oral cancer. In aggregate, our preclinical and clinical studies have the unifying goal of verifying the clinical value of PARPi-FL-based optical imaging for early detection and intraoperative margin assignment.",10068,560,1986,60

However, the effects of the NMDA partial agonist d-cycloserine on psychological treatment have been mixed. We investigated potential neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of d-cycloserine-augmented exposure, to inform the optimal combination of this and similar agents with psychological treatment.Methods Unmedicated patients with panic disorder were randomised to single-dose d-cycloserine (250mg; N=17) or matching placebo (N=16) 2hrs before one session of exposure therapy. Neurocognitive markers were assessed one day after treatment, including reaction-time based threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala response to threat. Clinical symptom severity was measured using self-report and clinician-rated scales the day before and after treatment, and at 1- and 6-months follow-up. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.Results One day after treatment, threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala threat response were attenuated in the drug compared to the placebo group. Lower amygdala magnitude predicted greater clinical improvement during follow-up across groups. D-cycloserine led to greater clinical recovery at 1-month follow-up (d-cycloserine 71% versus placebo 25%).Discussion D-cycloserine-augmented single-session exposure therapy reduces amygdala threat response, and this effect predicts later clinical response.

While low-dose chemotherapy reduces MDSCs in preclinical models, the use of this strategy to reduce MDSCs in GBM patients has yet to be evaluated.Methods A phase 0/1 dose-escalation clinical trial was conducted in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated 5-7 days prior to surgery with low-dose chemotherapy via capecitabine followed by concomitant low-dose capecitabine and bevacizumab. Clinical outcomes, including progression-free and overall survival, were measured, along with safety and toxicity profiles. Over the treatment time course, circulating MDSC levels were measured by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and tumor tissue immune profiles were assessed via mass cytometry time-of-flight.Results A total of 11 patients were enrolled across escalating dose cohorts of 150, 300, and 450 mg bid, with a progression-free survival of 5.8 months (range of 1.8-27.8 months) and an overall survival of 11.5 months (range of 3-&gt;28.0 months) from trial enrollment.

Instead, prosthesis users rely heavily on visual feedback, even though state transitions that are necessary to skillfully interact with objects, such as object contact, are relayed more precisely through tactile feedback4–6. Here we show that restoring tactile sensory feedback, through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex7, enables a person with a bidirectional intracortical brain-computer interface to improve their performance on functional object transport tasks completed with a neurally-controlled prosthetic limb. The participant had full visual feedback and had practiced the task for approximately two years prior to these experiments. Nevertheless, successful trial times on a commonly used clinical upper limb assessment task were reduced from a median time of 20.9 s (13.1 - 40.5 s interquartile range) to 10.2 s (5.4 - 18.1 s interquartile range) when vision was supplemented with microstimulation-evoked cutaneous percepts that were referred to different fingers and were graded in intensity based on real-time prosthesis contact forces. Faster completion times were primarily due to a reduction in the amount of time spent attempting to grasp objects. These results demonstrate the importance of tactile sensations in upper-limb control and the utility of creating bidirectional brain-computer interfaces to restore this stream of information using intracortical microstimulation.",6289,507,2381,26

We hypothesized that meditation before exercise would reduce disability and pain by increasing mindfulness prior to physical activity. Thirty-eight adults completed either meditation and exercise treatment (MedExT) (n=18) or an audiobook control condition (n=20). Over a 4-week period, participants in the MedExT group performed 12-17 minutes of guided meditation followed by 30 minutes of moderate intensity walking exercise 5 days per week.

We assessed therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability, and investigate indicators of in vivo efficacy of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor AZD4017 compared to placebo in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A multicenter, UK, 16-week phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks treatment with AZD4017 or placebo was conducted. Women aged 18 to 55 years with active idiopathic intracranial hypertension (&gt;25cmH2O lumbar puncture opening pressure and active papilledema) were included. Participants received 400mg twice daily of oral AZD4017 compared to matching placebo over 12-weeks. The outcome measures were initial efficacy, safety and tolerability. The primary clinical outcome was lumbar puncture opening pressure at 12 weeks analysed by intention-to-treat. Secondary clinical outcomes were symptoms, visual function, papilledema, headache and anthropological measures. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in the central nervous system and systemically. 31 subjects (mean age 31.2 (SD=6.9) years and BMI 39.2 (SD=12.6) kg/m2) were randomized to AZD4017 (n=17) or placebo (n=14). At 12 weeks, lumbar puncture pressure was lower in the AZD4017 group (29.7 cmH2O) compared with placebo (31.3 cmH2O), but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (mean difference: −2.8, 95% confidence interval: −7.1-1.5; p=0.2). An exploratory analysis assessing mean change in lumbar puncture pressure within each group found a significant decrease in the AZD4017 group (mean change: −4.3 cmH2O (SD=5.7); p=0.009) but not in the placebo group (mean change: −0.3 cmH2O (SD=5.9); p=0.8). AZD4017 was safe, with no withdrawals related to adverse effects. Nine transient drug-related adverse events were reported. One serious adverse event occurred in the placebo group (deterioration requiring shunt surgery). In vivo biomarkers of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity (urinary glucocorticoid metabolites, hepatic prednisolone generation and CSF cortisone to cortisol ratios) demonstrated significant enzyme inhibition. This is the first phase 2 randomized controlled trial in idiopathic intracranial hypertension evaluating a novel therapeutic target. AZD4017 was safe, well-tolerated and inhibited 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity in vivo. Possible clinical benefits were noted in this small cohort. A longer, larger study would now be of interest.",4825,178,1148,38

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SSRI citalopram combined with part-time patching of the fellow fixing eye would improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in adult humans. Following a cross-over, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design (pre-registration: ACTRN12611000669998), participants completed two 2-week blocks of fellow fixing eye patching. One block combined patching with citalopram (20 mg/day) and the other with a placebo tablet. The blocks were separated by a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye visual acuity. Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity and electrophysiological measures of retinal and cortical function. Seven participants were randomized, fewer than our pre-specified sample size of 20. There were no statistically significant differences in amblyopic eye visual acuity change between the active (mean ± SD change = 0.08±0.16 logMAR) and the placebo (mean change = −0.01±0.03 logMAR) blocks. No treatment effects were observed for any secondary outcomes. However, 3 of 7 participants experienced a 0.1 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block. These results from a small sample suggest that larger-scale trials of SSRI treatment for adult amblyopia may be warranted.

GHD (n=71) and TS patients (n=43) were recruited in a study on the long term response to r-hGH over five years of therapy. Pharmacogenomic analysis was performed using 1219 genetic markers and baseline blood transcriptome. Random forest was used to determine predictive value of transcriptomic data associated with growth response. No genetic marker passed the stringency criteria required for predictive value. However, we demonstrated that transcriptomic data can be used to predict growth with a high accuracy (AUC &gt; 0.9) for short and long term therapeutic response in GHD and TS. Network models identified an identical core set of genes in both GHD and TS at each year of therapy whose expression can be used to classify therapeutic response to r-hGH. Combining transcriptomic markers with clinical phenotype was shown to significantly reduce predictive error. We have characterised the utility of baseline transcriptome for the prediction of growth response including the identification of a set of common genes in GHD and TS.

Barriers to cervical cancer screening include lack of awareness of cervical cancer and the cervix, fear of the speculum, and lack of women-centric technologies. We developed a low-cost (∼$50), cervix-imaging device called the Callascope, which comprises an imaging component, camera and inserter that eliminates the need for a speculum and enables self-insertion. We sought to assess the quality of physicians’ images of the cervix using the Callascope versus the speculum in live patients and study women’s willingness to independently use the Callascope to image their cervix.Methods We conducted two main studies: (1) a clinical study in which a physician imaged the cervix of patients using both the speculum and Callascope in a 2×2 crossover design; and (2) home-based self-cervix imaging with the Callascope.Results Participants of the clinical study (n=28) and home study (n=12) all indicated greater comfort and an overall preference for the Callascope over the speculum. The clinical study data indicated that the Callascope enabled similar visualization compared to the speculum while significantly improving patient experience. With physician insertion and manipulation, the Callascope enabled cervix visualization for 82% of participants. In the home-study, 83% of participants were able to visualize their cervix with the Callascope on the first try and 100% after multiple attempts.Conclusion The Callascope is more comfortable and provides similar visualization to the speculum. The Callascope can be used by medical providers for clinical exams while also enabling home self-screening for cervical cancer and promoting a better understanding of one’s cervix to increase awareness of cervical screening needs.

Kendrick, Benjamin Becker",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/512657 ,"Extinction is considered a core mechanism underlying exposure-based therapy in anxiety-related disorders. However, marked impairments in threat extinction learning coupled with impaired neuroplasticity in patients strongly impede the efficacy of exposure-based interventions. Recent translational research suggests a role of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system in both these processes. However, the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the RA system to enhance threat extinction in humans and the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The present pre-registered, randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological neuroimaging trial demonstrates that pre-extinction administration of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan accelerated attenuation of the psychophysiological threat response during extinction. On the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threat-signal specific enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis and voxel-wise mediation analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically involved treatment-induced modulation of vmPFC activation. Overall the results provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate the efficacy of extinction-based therapies.",5536,511,1700,56

Nevertheless, basic questions remain about the benefits of such programs, and about the degree to which participant expectations might influence training and transfer. Here we examined a commercial cognitive training program (Activate) in a 5-week double-blind, pseudo-randomized placebo-controlled trial. Based on a priori power analysis, we recruited 99 healthy older adults 59-91 years of age (M = 68.87, SD = 6.31; 69 women), assigning them to either the intervention or an active control program (Sudoku and n-back working memory exercises). We subdivided both groups into high and low expectation priming conditions, to probe for effects of participants’ expectations on training and transfer. We assessed transfer using a battery of standard neuropsychological and psychosocial measures that had been agreed to by the training program developers. We planned and pre-registered our analyses (on osf.io). The majority (88%) of participants progressed through the training, and most provided positive feedback about it. Similarly, the majority (80%) of participants believed they were truly training their brains. Yet, transfer of training was minimal. Also minimal were any effects of expectations on training and transfer, although participants who received high expectation priming tended to engage more with their assigned program overall.

However, few eye tracking studies have compared the relative efficacy of different paradigms to discriminate between autistic compared with typically developing children and their sensitivity to specific symptoms. To target this issue, the current study used three common eye tracking protocols contrasting social versus non-social stimuli in young (2-7 years old) Chinese autistic (n = 35) and typically developing (n = 34) children matched for age and gender. Protocols included dancing people vs. dynamic geometrical images, biological motion (dynamic light point walking human or cat) vs. non-biological motion (scrambled controls) and child playing with toy vs. toy alone. Although all three paradigms differentiated autistic and typically developing children, the dancing people versus dynamic geometry pattern paradigm was the most effective, with autistic children showing marked reductions in visual preference for dancing people and correspondingly increased one for geometric patterns. Furthermore, this altered visual preference in autistic children was correlated with the ADOS social affect score and had the highest discrimination accuracy. Our results therefore indicate that decreased visual preference for dynamic social stimuli may be the most effective visual attention-based paradigm for use as a biomarker for autism in Chinese children.

A few days later, they walked on a street for 1 h. Within each activity, the starting and ending levels of plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum aldosterone (SA) were compared using paired t-test. Total urine volume, creatinine clearance, and change in PRA levels between each activity were compared by t-test. Regression coefficients for total urine volume and creatinine clearance during pool walking were estimated by linear regression and additionally controlled for the change in PRA levels. Land walking served as the reference group.Results Within each activity, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone levels were suppressed during pool walking: the mean starting and ending values of PRA and SA were 6.8 vs. 5.5 ng/mL/h (p=0.002) and 654 vs. 473 pg/mL (p=0.02), respectively. Compared to land walking, the decrease in PRA level was more evident in pool walking (−1.27 vs. 0.81 ng/mL/h, p=0.004), resulting in higher total urine volume and creatinine clearance in pool walking (both p&lt;0.05).

All patients received an educational letter and a standing urinalysis lab order, and then were randomized to control (usual care) or intervention. Intervention arm participants were invited to complete proteinuria screening with a mailed home smartphone urinalysis test. Co-primary outcomes were completion of proteinuria screening and number of albuminuria cases (albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥ 30 mg/g or protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 150 mg/g) at the end of 3 months. We also evaluated patient satisfaction with the home test, and compliance with recommendations for patients with newly detected albuminuria.Results A total of 999 patients were randomized to intervention or control. Out of 499 patients assigned to the intervention arm, 253 were reached by phone, and 69/97 (71.1%) consented patients completed the home test. Overall, the intervention increased proteinuria screening completion (28.9% vs. 18.0%; p&lt;0.001) with no effect on the number of albuminuria cases (4 vs. 4) although only 6/57 (10.5%) patients with trace or 1+ urine dipstick protein had a follow-up quantitative test. Among the 55 patients who completed a survey after the home test, 89% preferred testing at home rather than the physician’s office.Conclusions A strategy using a home urinalysis smartphone test increased proteinuria screening rates in previously unscreened patients with hypertension and may be useful in increasing rates of proteinuria screening compliance.

Training that targets recognition of low intensity emotional expressions may therefore be effective as an intervention to improve social-emotional skills. This paper reports the results of two randomised controlled experiments looking at the effect of a training methodology designed to increase the recognition of happy emotion in low intensity happy facial expressions. The first study implements this training with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N = 14) and the second study implements this training with adults with ASD (N = 27). The training paradigm used images from a morph sequence that mixed a happy expression with a mixed-emotion ‘norm’ expression to create a sequence of varying intensity happy expressions. Participants were asked to say whether or not individual faces from the sequence were happy, to measure their happiness detection threshold. Participants that received active training were given biased feedback to shift their detection threshold, while participants that received control training were given feedback consistent with their baseline threshold. There was some statistical evidence that thresholds in the active training group shifted more than in the control group. This suggests training was successful in increasing the number of expressions that individuals identified as happy. However, there was no evidence that training increased facial expression recognition accuracy, as measured by the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task completed after training (Study 2).",3919,139,1283,16

For patients with a spinal cord injury (SCI), FES can prevent muscular atrophy, reduce spasticity and/or restore limb movements. To this last aim, FES external devices can be used, but elicit imprecise movements. FES implanted devices used neuromuscular stimulation and required implantation of one electrode for each site (muscle) to stimulate, an heavy surgical procedure and 10 times more electrical charges than nerve stimulation. Moreover, complications related to the numerous implanted components could appear over time. The purpose of this work is to evaluate whether a multi-contact nerve cuff electrode can selectively activate forearm and hand muscles and restore functional movements in patient with a complete tetraplegia.Methods A 12-contacts cuff electrode was designed to selectively activate, without damage it, multi fascicular peripheral nerve (1). Six subjects rwith at least one extensor or one flexor muscle stimulable by surface electrical stimulation, have been enrolled into the study. During the surgical procedure, radial or median nerve was stimulated through up to 35 different configurations of stimulation at an intensity up to 2.1 mA (25 Hz, pulse width 250 µs, inter-pulse 100 µs).

Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months of age. Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible for infant growth, decreasing alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, and modulating gut microbiome and metabolome when compared to control. Rice bran merits investigation as a practical intervention strategy that could decrease EED prevalence and risk for children from low- and middle-income countries where rice is grown as a staple food, and bran is used as animal feed or wasted.One Sentence Summary Dietary rice bran supplementation during infant weaning from 6-12 months of age improved growth outcomes, modulated environmental enteric dysfunction biomarkers, and supported metabolism by the gut microbiome.The authors declare no competing financial or non financial interests to disclose as defined by Nature Research.

The reasons for this are unclear, but may be due to impaired replicative fitness of pH1N1 A/California/07/2009-like (Cal09) LAIV strains.Methods In an open-label, prospective, observational, phase 4 study, we evaluated the impact of updating the pH1N1 component in the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV from Cal09 in 2016-17 (n=118) to an A/Michigan/45/2015-like strain (A/17/New York/15/5364, NY15) in 2017-18 (n=126), on shedding and immunogenicity in Gambian children aged 2-4 years old. The study was nested within a larger randomised controlled trial investigating LAIV-microbiome interactions (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02972957).Findings Cal09 showed impaired nasopharyngeal shedding compared to H3N2 and influenza B, along with sub-optimal serum antibody and T-cell responses. Following the switch to NY15, a significant increase in pH1N1 shedding was seen, along with improvements in seroconversion and influenza-specific CD4+ T-cell responses. Viral kinetics in vitro mirrored these findings, with NY15 showing greater replicative ability than Cal09 in human nasal epithelial cells. Persistent shedding to day 7 was independently associated with both seroconversion and CD4+ T cell response in multivariable logistic regression.Interpretation Our results suggest that the pH1N1 component switch in LAIV may have overcome problems in prior formulations. LAIV effectiveness against pH1N1 should therefore improve in upcoming influenza seasons. Our data also highlight the importance of evaluating replicative fitness, in addition to antigenicity, when selecting annual LAIV components and design of potentially more effective vaccines.Funding The Wellcome Trust.",4255,176,1262,29

Luby",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/512509 ,"Background Soil transmitted helminths (STH) infect &gt;1.5 billion people. Mass drug administration (MDA) reduces infection; however, drug resistance is emerging and reinfection occurs rapidly. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh (WASH Benefits, NCT01590095) to assess whether water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition interventions, alone and combined, reduce STH in a setting with ongoing MDA.Methodology/Principal Findings We randomized clusters of pregnant women into water treatment, sanitation, handwashing, combined water+sanitation+handwashing (WSH), nutrition, nutrition+WSH (N+WSH) or control arms. After 2.5 years of intervention, we enumerated STH infections in children aged 2-12 years with Kato-Katz. We estimated intention-to-treat intervention effects on infection prevalence and intensity. Participants and field staff were not blinded; laboratory technicians and data analysts were blinded.In 2012-2013, we randomized 5551 women in 720 clusters. In 2015-2016, we enrolled 7795 children of 4102 available women for STH follow-up and collected stool from 7187. Prevalence among controls was 36.8% for A. lumbricoides, 9.2% for hookworm and 7.5% for T. trichiura. Most infections were low-intensity. Compared to controls, the water intervention reduced hookworm (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.69 (0.50, 0.95), prevalence difference [PD]=−2.83 (−5.16, −0.50)) but did not affect other STH. Sanitation improvements reduced T. trichiura (PR=0.71 (0.52, 0.98), PD=−2.17 (−4.03, −0.38)), had a similar borderline effect on hookworm and no effect on A. lumbricoides. Handwashing and nutrition interventions did not reduce any STH. WSH and N+WSH reduced hookworm prevalence by 29-33% (2-3 percentage points) and marginally reduced A. lumbricoides. Effects on infection intensity were similar.Conclusions/Significance In a low-intensity infection setting with MDA, we found modest but sustained hookworm reduction from water treatment, sanitation and combined WSH interventions. Interventions more effectively reduced STH species with no persistent environmental reservoirs. Our findings highlight waterborne transmission for hookworm and suggest that water treatment and sanitation improvements can augment MDA programs to interrupt STH transmission.Author summary Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infect &gt;1.5 billion people worldwide. Mass-administration of deworming drugs is the cornerstone of global strategy for STH control but treated individuals often rapidly get reinfected and there is also concern about emerging drug resistance. Interventions to treat drinking water, wash hands at critical times and isolate human feces from the environment through improved sanitation could reduce STH transmission by reducing the spread of ova from the feces of infected individuals into the environment and subsequently to new hosts, while nutrition improvements could reduce host susceptibility to infection. Existing evidence on the effect of these interventions on STH is scarce. In a setting with ongoing mass-drug administration, we assessed the effect of individual and combined water, sanitation, handwashing and nutrition interventions on STH infection in children. Approximately 2.5 years after delivering interventions, we found reductions in STH infection from water treatment and sanitation interventions; there was no reduction from the handwashing and nutrition interventions. While the reductions were modest in magnitude compared to cure rates achieved by deworming drugs, they indicated sustained reduction in environmental transmission. The reductions were more pronounced for STH species that do not have persistent environmental reservoirs. These findings suggest that water treatment and sanitation interventions can augment mass-drug administration programs in striving toward elimination of STH.",4234,182,1454,42

Hatfield, David J. Cohen, Suzanne V. Arnold, Martin Ho, Philip G. Jones, Martin Leon, Bram Zuckerman, John A. Spertus",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/513895 ,"Background Survival and health status (e.g., symptoms and quality of life) are key outcomes in clinical trials of heart failure treatment. However, health status can only be recorded on survivors, potentially biasing treatment effect estimates when there is differential survival across treatment groups. Joint modeling of survival and health status can address this bias.Methods and Results We analyzed patient-level data from the PARTNER 1B trial of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus standard care. Health status was quantified with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) at randomization, 1, 6, and 12 months. We compared hazard ratios for survival and mean differences in KCCQ scores at 12 months using several models: the original growth curve model for KCCQ scores (ignoring death), separate Bayesian models for survival and KCCQ scores, and a Bayesian joint longitudinal-survival model fit to either 12 or 30 months of survival follow-up. The benefit of TAVR on 12-month KCCQ scores was greatest in the joint model fit to all survival data (mean difference = 33.7 points; 95% CrI: 24.2, 42.4), followed by the joint model fit to 12 months of survival follow-up (32.3 points; 95% CrI: 22.5, 41.5), a Bayesian model without integrating death (30.4 points; 95% CrI: 21.4, 39.3), and the original growth curve model (26.0 points; 95% CI: 18.7, 33.3). At 12 months, the survival benefit of TAVR was also greater in the joint model (hazard ratio = 0.50; 95% CrI: 0.32, 0.73) than in the non-joint Bayesian model (0.54; 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.75) or the original Kaplan-Meier estimate (0.55; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.74).Conclusions In patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and prohibitive surgical risk, the estimated benefits of TAVR on survival and health status compared with standard care were greater in joint Bayesian models than other approaches.",3871,182,1215,18

Davis, Larisa G.

We studied how much blood pressure (BP) change and evolving LVH contribute to the effect that lisinopril, doxazosin, amlodipine have on HF compared to chlorthalidone.Methods We conducted causal mediation analysis of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) data. ALLHAT participants with available serial ECGs and BP measurements were included (n=29,892; mean age 67±4 y; 32% black; 56% men): 11,008 were randomized to chlorthalidone, 5,967 – to doxazosin, 6,593 – to amlodipine, and 6,324 – to lisinopril. Evolving ECG-LVH, and BP-lowering served as mediators. Incident symptomatic HF was the primary outcome. Linear regression (for mediator) and logistic regression (for outcome) models were adjusted for mediator-outcome confounders (demographic and clinical characteristics known to be associated both with both LVH/HTN and HF).Results A large majority of participants (96%) had ECG-LVH status unchanged; 4% developed evolving ECG-LVH. On average, BP decreased by 11/7 mmHg. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, progressing ECG-LVH [HR 1.78(1.43-2.22)], resolving ECG-LVH [HR 1.33(1.03-1.70)], and baseline ECG-LVH [1.17(1.04-1.31)] carried risk of incident HF. After full adjustment, evolving ECG-LVH mediated 4% of the effect of doxazosin on HF. Systolic BP-lowering mediated 12% of the effect of doxazosin, and diastolic BP-lowering mediated 10% effect of doxazosin, 7% effect of amlodipine, and borderline 9% effect of lisinopril on HF.Conclusions Evolving ECG-LVH and BP change account for 4-13% of the mechanism by which antihypertensive medications prevent HF.",4087,209,1301,37

The outcome measures included total and subscale scores of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive 12 (ADAS-Cog 12), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) and the AD composite score (ADCOMS), an outcome measure recently developed to detect treatment responses in subjects with prodromal AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau and P181 tau were measured in a subset of samples (n = 55). Regression analyses were adjusted for potential confounders and effect modifiers in order to examine the interactive effects of nilvadipine and AD severity on cognitive outcomes over 78-weeks.Results Compared to their respective placebo-controls, nilvadipine-treated, very mild AD subjects showed less decline, whereas moderate AD subjects showed greater decline on the ADAS-Cog 12. Also in very mild AD, a beneficial effect (as measured by ADCOMS), was detected in the nilvadipine treated group. Therapeutic effects of nilvadipine were also observed for a composite memory trait in very mild AD subjects and a composite language trait in mild AD subjects. CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios were increased in mild AD and decreased in moderate AD patients treated with nilvadipine, compared to their respective controls.Conclusion These data suggest that very mild AD subjects benefited from nilvadipine and that future clinical trials of nilvadipine in this population are required to confirm these findings.Trial Registration NCT02017340 Registered 20 December 2013, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02017340EUDRACT Reference Number 2012-002764-27 Registered 04 February 2013, https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2012-002764-27",2537,260,821,26

Cognitive bias modification paradigms have been developed to attenuate cognitive biases but there have been few studies that examined neural responses to these paradigms. This study compared neural responses following CBM and explored whether CBM effects were potentiated by varenicline administration. This was a double-blind placebo-controlled study with two between subject factors of drug (varenicline, placebo) and CBM (attend towards smoking cues, train away from smoking cues, control training) that recruited daily (≥ 10 cigarettes per day) non-treatment seeking smokers. Participants (n = 67, 53% female) were randomised to one-week of drug administration (varenicline or placebo) before attending a study session at which they were randomised to CBM condition, and underwent an fMRI scan were they were presented with smoking and neutral cues. Neural response to smoking (vs. neutral) cues, cognitive bias, craving and mood were assessed. There was no evidence of CBM effects on any outcomes. There was evidence of effects of varenicline on craving, with greater reductions in craving in the week preceding the study session in the varencline group (p = 0.04, ηp2 = .06). There was also evidence of a drug by CBM interaction for neural responses (z = 3.78, p &lt;0.001). Compared to placebo, varenicline was associated with greater activation in the right temporal middle gyrus in the CBM control condition, compared to an opposite effect in the CBM “attend towards” condition. These data suggest that CBM does not modify cognitive bias, subjective craving and mood, or neural response to smoking cues.

Here, we report the effect of the CCI on surrogate scores of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis.Methods This was a non-randomized longitudinal study, including adults with T2D who were self-enrolled to the CCI (n=262) or to receive usual care (UC, n=87) during one year. A NAFLD liver fat score [N-LFS] &gt; −0.640 defined the presence of fatty liver. A NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS] of &gt; 0.675 identified subjects with advanced fibrosis.

Hilland, N.I. Landrø, C. J. Harmer, M. Browning, L. A. Maglanoc, R. Jonassen",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/322842 ,Background Modification of attentional biases (ABM) may lead to more adaptive emotion perception and emotion regulation. Understanding the neural basis of these effects may lead to greater precision for future treatment development. Task-related fMRI following ABM training has so far not been investigated in depression. The main aim of the RCT was to explore differences in brain activity after ABM training in response to emotional stimuli.Methods A total of 134 previously depressed individuals were randomized into 14 days of ABM- or a placebo training followed by an fMRI emotion regulation task. Depression symptoms and subjective ratings of perceived negativity during fMRI was examined between the training groups. Brain activation was explored within predefined areas (SVC) and across the whole brain. Activation in areas associated with changes in attentional biases (AB) and degree of depression was explored.Results The ABM group showed reduced activation within the amygdala and within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when passively viewing negative images compared to the placebo group. No group differences were found within predefined SVC’s associated with emotion regulation strategies. Response within the temporal cortices was associated with degree of change in AB and with degree of depressive symptoms in ABM versus placebo.Limitations The findings should be replicated in other samples of depressed patients and in studies using designs that allow analyses of within-group variability from baseline to follow-up.Conclusions ABM training has an effect on brain function within circuitry associated with emotional appraisal and the generation of affective states.Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02931487,3042,440,1144,23

Specific Lactobacillus strains were selected in the lab and formulated in a viable form in an oil in water-based topical cream. Facial application by patients with mild-to-moderate acne symptoms was able to reduce inflammatory lesions and comedone formation. This was associated with a temporary modulation of the skin microbiome, including a reduction in relative abundance of staphylococci and an increase in lactobacilli.

Interventions that simultaneously address several risk factors at the household level have great potential to reduce these negative effects. We present the design and baseline findings of a cluster-randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of an integrated home-environmental intervention package and an early child development programme to improve diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and childhood developmental outcomes in children under 36 months of age living in resource-limited rural Andean Peru.Methods We collected baseline data on children’s developmental performance, health status and demography as well as microbial contamination in drinking water. In a sub-sample of households, we measured indoor and personal 24-hour air concentration levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).Results We recruited and randomised 317 children from 40 community-clusters to four study arms. At baseline, all arms had similar health and demographic characteristics, and the developmental status of children was comparable between arms. The analysis revealed that more than 25% of mothers completed primary education, a large proportion of children were stunted and diarrhoea prevalence was above 18%. Fifty-two percent of drinking water samples tested positive for thermo-tolerant coliforms and the occurrence of E.coli was evenly distributed between arms. The mean levels of kitchen PM2.5 and CO concentrations were 213 μg/m3 and 4.8 ppm, respectively.Conclusions The trial arms are balanced with respect to most baseline characteristics, such as household air and water pollution, and child development. These results ensure the possible estimation of the trial effectiveness. This trial will yield valuable information for assessing synergic, rational and cost-effective benefits of the combination of home-based interventions.Trial registration retrospectively registered on 15th January 2018.

Improved water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition could be more sustainable control strategies for parasite infections than mass drug administration (MDA), while providing other quality of life benefits.Methods and Findings. We enrolled geographic clusters of pregnant women into a cluster-randomized controlled trial that tested six interventions: disinfecting drinking water(W), improved sanitation(S), handwashing with soap(H), combined WSH, improved nutrition(N), and combined WSHN. We assessed intervention effects on parasite infections by measuring Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm, and Giardia duodenalis among individual children born to enrolled mothers and their older siblings (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105). We collected stool specimens from 9077 total children in 622 clusters, including 2346 children in control, 1117 in water, 1160 in sanitation, 1141 in handwashing, 1064 in WSH, 1072 in nutrition, and 1177 in WSHN. In the control group, 23% of children were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, 1% with Trichuris trichuria, 2% with hookworm and 39% with Giardia duodenalis. After two years of intervention exposure, Ascaris infection prevalence was 18% lower in the water treatment arm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0%, 33%), 22% lower in the WSH arm (CI 4%, 37%), and 22% lower in the WSHN arm (CI 4%, 36%) compared to control. Individual sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition did not significantly reduce Ascaris infection on their own, and integrating nutrition with WSH did not provide additional benefit. Trichuris and hookworm were rarely detected, resulting in imprecise effect estimates. No intervention reduced Giardia. Reanalysis of stool samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed the reductions in Ascaris infections measured by microscopy in the WSH and WSHN groups. Lab technicians and data analysts were blinded to treatment assignment, but participants and sample collectors were not blinded. The trial was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID.Conclusions. Our results suggest integration of improved water quality, sanitation, and handwashing could contribute to sustainable control strategies for Ascaris infections, particularly in similar settings with recent or ongoing deworming programs. Water treatment alone was similarly effective to integrated WSH, providing new evidence that drinking water should be given increased attention as a transmission pathway for Ascaris.",1704,213,653,31

Gunning",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/465013 ,"Low Field Magnetic Stimulation is a potentially rapid-acting treatment for depression with mood-enhancing effects in as little as one 20-minute session. The most convincing data for LFMS has come from treating bipolar depression. We examined whether LFMS also has rapid mood-enhancing effects in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and whether these effects are dose-dependent. We hypothesized that a single 20-min session of LFMS would reduce depressive symptom severity and that the magnitude of this change would be greater after three 20-min sessions than after a single 20-min session. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 30 participants (age 21–65) with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to three 20-minute active or sham LFMS treatments with 48 hours between treatments. Response was assessed immediately following LFMS treatment using the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-6), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and the Visual Analog Scale. Following the third session of LFMS, the effect of LFMS on VAS and HAMD-6 was superior to sham (F(1, 24) = 7.45, p = 0.03, Holm-Bonferroni corrected; F(1,22) = 6.92, p = 0.03, Holm-Bonferroni corrected, respectively). There were no differences between sham and LFMS following the initial or second session with the effect not becoming significant until after the third session. Three 20-minute LFMS sessions were required for active LFMS to have a mood-enhancing effect for individuals with treatment-resistant depression. As this effect may be transient, future work should address dosing schedules of longer treatment course as well as biomarker-based targeting of LFMS to optimize patient selection and treatment outcomes.",1333,302,635,18

However, which antibiotics should be used is still debatable, as relevant studies were conducted more than 20 years ago, were single centre or country, insufficiently powered, evaluated antibiotics not in clinical use anymore and had variable inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a major problem in many countries worldwide. We hypothesized that efficacy of meropenem as a broad spectrum antibiotic is superior to standard of care regimen (SOC) in empiric treatment of LOS and thus aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of meropenem to SOC in infants aged &lt;90 days with LOS.Methods and findings NeoMero-1 was a randomized, open-label, phase III superiority trial conducted in 18 neonatal units in 6 countries. Infants with post-menstrual age (PMA) of ≤44 weeks with positive blood culture and one, or those with negative culture and at least with two predefined clinical and laboratory signs suggestive of LOS, or those with PMA &gt;44 weeks meeting the Goldstein criteria of sepsis, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive meropenem or SOC (ampicillin+gentamicin or cefotaxime+gentamicin) for 8-14 days. The primary outcome was treatment success (survival, no modification of allocated therapy, resolution/improvement of clinical and laboratory markers, no need of additional antibiotics and presumed/confirmed eradication of pathogens) at test-of-cure visit (TOC) in full analysis set. Stool samples were tested at baseline and day 28 for meropenem-resistant Gram-negative organisms (CRGNO).The primary analysis was performed in all randomised patients (full analysis set) and in patients with culture confirmed LOS. Proportions of participants with successful outcome were compared by using a logistic regression model adjusted for the stratification factors.From September 3rd 2012 to November 30th 2014, in total 136 patients in each arm were randomized; 140 (52%) were culture positive. Success at TOC was achieved in 44/136 (32%) in the meropenem arm vs. 31/135 (23%) in the SOC arm (p=0.087); 17/63 (27%) vs. 10/77 (13%) in patients with positive cultures (p=0.022). The main reason of failure was modification of allocated therapy. Adverse events occurred in 72% and serious adverse events in 17% of patients, the mortality rate was 6% with no differences between study arms. Cumulative acquisition of CRGNO by day 28 occurred in 4% in the meropenem and 12% in the SOC arm (p=0.052).Conclusions Meropenem was not superior to SOC in terms of success at TOC, short term hearing disturbances, safety or mortality and did not outselect colonization with CRGNOs. Meropenem as broad-spectrum antibiotic should be reserved for neonates who are more likely to have Gram-negative LOS, especially in NICUs where microorganisms producing ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases are circulating.",1374,283,729,36

We evaluate for the first time the potential of tDCS, coupled with motor skill training, to accelerate the development of laparoscopic technical skills. In this pre-registered, double-blinded and sham-controlled study, 60 healthy subjects were randomized into sham or active tDCS in either bilateral primary motor cortex (bM1) or supplementary motor area (SMA) electrode configurations. All subjects practiced the Fundamental of Laparoscopic Surgery Peg Transfer Task during a pre-test, six 20-minute training sessions, and a post-test. The primary outcome was change in laparoscopic skill performance over time, quantified by improvement in performance according to a seconds-per-object calculated score accounting for errors. Sixty participants were randomized equally into the three training cohorts (active bM1, active SMA, sham). The active groups had significantly greater improvement in performance from pre-test to post-test compared to the sham groups (108 vs 76 seconds, p = 0.018). Both bM1 and SMA active cohorts had significantly greater improvement in learning (p &lt; 0.01), achieving the same skill level in 4 sessions compared to the 6 sessions required of the sham cohort. The SMA cohort had more variability in performance compared to the bM1 and control cohorts. Laparoscopic skill training with active, bM1 or SMA, tDCS exhibited significantly greater learning relative to training with sham tDCS. The potential for tDCS to enhance the training of surgical skills merits further investigation to determine if these preliminary results may be replicated.",1217,255,541,20

Little is known, however, about what constitutes an effective dosage of therapy.Methods This is a parallel group, four arm, single blind, phase I, randomized control trial of four dosages of upper extremity therapy delivered in an outpatient setting during the chronic phase after stroke. Participants were randomized into groups that varied in total dosage of therapy (i.e., 0, 15, 30, or 60 hours). Seven hundred and four participants were assessed for eligibility, 50 were eligible to enroll, 45 were randomized, 44 participated and 41 completed the study. Planned primary analyses used linear mixed effects regression to model baseline to post-intervention changes in the Motor Activity Log-Quality of Movement rating (MALQ) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) time score as a function of therapy dosage. A series of hierarchical models were constructed using the MALQ and WMFT.Results We observed a significant dose response curve: the greater the dosage of training, the greater the change in MALQ, with the dose by week slope parameter of 0.0045 (ΔMAL/hour/week; p = 0.0011; 95% CI = [0.0019; 0.0071]). Over the 3 weeks of therapy, this corresponds to a gain of 0.81 in MALQ for the 60 hour dose.Conclusions For mild-to-moderately impaired stroke survivors, the dosage of a patient-centered, task specific motor therapy was shown to systematically influence the gain in quality of arm use in the natural environment, but not functional capacity as measured in the laboratory. We highlight the importance of recovery outcomes that capture arm use vs. functional capacity.Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Linear regression analyses, adjusted for baseline values, were performed to estimate intervention effects on an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.Findings 45 patients (HTB n = 22; PEP n = 23) were randomized and analyzed according to ITT (mean age = 48.4 years, SD = 11.3, mean HAM-D score = 21.7, SD = 3.2). Baseline-adjusted mean difference was 4.3 points in the HAM-D score in favor of HTB (p&lt;0.001). This improvement was achieved after two weeks. Compliance with the intervention and follow-up was far better in the HTB group (2 vs 13 dropouts). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Main limitation: the number of dropouts in the PEP group (13 of 23) was far higher than in other trials investigating exercise in depression (18.1 % dropouts).Conclusions HTB seems to be a fast-acting, safe and easy accessible method leading to clinically relevant improvement in depressive disorder after two weeks; it is also suitable for persons who have problems performing exercise training.Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) with the registration number DRKS00011013 (registration date 2016-09-19) before onset of the study.",3398,466,6254,25

Haaland, Torkil Berge, Nils Inge Landrø",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/318279 ,"Background Following treatment, many depressed patients have significant residual symptoms. However, large randomised controlled trials (RCT) in this population are lacking. When Attention bias modification training (ABM) leads to more positive emotional biases, associated changes in clinical symptoms have been reported. A broader and more transparent picture of the true advantage of ABM based on larger and more stringent clinical trials have been requested.Aims To evaluate the early effect of two weeks ABM training on blinded clinician-rated and self-reported residual symptoms, and whether changes towards more positive attentional biases (AB) would be associated with symptom reduction.Method A total of 321 patients with a history of depression were included in a preregistered randomized controlled double-blinded trial. Patients were randomised to an emotional ABM paradigm over fourteen days or a closely matched control condition. Symptoms based on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) were obtained at baseline and after ABM training.Results ABM training led to significantly greater decrease in clinician-rated symptoms of depression as compared to the control condition. No differences between ABM and placebo were found for self-reported symptoms. ABM induced a change of AB towards relatively more positive stimuli associated with greater symptom reduction.Conclusion The current study demonstrates that ABM produces early changes in both AB and blinded clinician-rated depressive symptoms. ABM may have practical potential in the treatment of residual depression.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02658682",2106,287,683,16

Obesity is an important modifiable risk factor for both the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. Consequently, international guidelines recommend patients with knee osteoarthritis who are overweight receive support to lose weight. However, few overweight patients with knee osteoarthritis receive care to support weight loss. Telephone-based interventions are one potential solution to provide scalable care to the many patients with knee osteoarthritis. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for patients with knee osteoarthritis, who are overweight or obese, is cost-effective from a societal perspective compared to usual care.Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. We randomised 120 patients with knee osteoarthritis to an intervention or usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention group received a referral to an existing non-disease specific 6-month telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service. For this economic evaluation, the primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs (healthcare services and medication use) and absenteeism costs due to knee pain. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective.Results Mean cost differences between groups (intervention minus control) were, $454 (95%CI: −2735 to 4206) for healthcare costs, $−36, (95%CI: −73 to 2) for medication costs, and $−13 (95%CI: −225 to 235) for absenteeism costs. The total mean difference in societal costs was $1022 (95%CI: −2201 to 4771). For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with usual care was less than 0.33 at all willingness-to-pay values.Conclusions From a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support, provided using an existing non-disease specific 6-month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis for QALYs, pain intensity, disability, weight, and BMI.Trial Registration number ACTRN12615000490572",2476,222,588,26

Sweeney",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/343251 ,"Background Ketogenic therapy (KT) in the form of ketogenic diets (KDs) and/or supplements that induce nutritional ketosis have gained interest as a complementary treatment for cancer patients. Besides putative anti-tumor effects, preclinical and preliminary clinical data indicate that KT could induce favorable changes in body composition of the tumor bearing host. Here we present first results of our ongoing KETOCOMP study (NCT02516501) study concerning body composition changes among rectal, breast and head &amp; neck cancer (HNC) patients who underwent concurrent KT during standard-of-care radiotherapy (RT).Methods Eligible patients were assigned to one of three groups: (i) a standard diet group; (ii) a ketogenic breakfast group taking 50-250 ml of a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) drink plus 10 g essential amino acids in the morning of RT days; (iii) a complete KD group supplemented with 10 g essential amino acids on RT days. Body composition was to be measured prior to and weekly during RT using 8-electrode bioimpedance analysis. Longitudinal data were analyzed using mixed effects linear regression.Results A total of 17 patients underwent KT during RT thus far (rectal cancer: n=6; HNC: n=6; breast cancer: n=5). All patients consuming a KD (n=14) reached nutritional ketosis and finished the study protocol with only minor problems reported. Compared to control subjects, the ketogenic intervention in rectal and breast cancer patients was significantly associated with a decline in fat mass over time (−0.3 and −0.5 kg/week, respectively), with no significant changes in skeletal muscle mass. In HNC patients, concurrent chemotherapy was the strongest predictor of body weight, fat free and skeletal muscle mass decline during radiotherapy, while KT showed significant opposite associations. Rectal cancer patients who underwent KT during neoadjuvant RT had significantly better tumor response at the time of surgery as assessed by the Dworak regression grade (median 3 versus 2, p=0.04483).Conclusions While sample sizes are still small our results already indicate some significant favorable effects of KT on body composition. These as well as a putative radiosensitizing effect on rectal tumor cells need to be confirmed once the final analysis of our study becomes possible.",3290,294,688,29

The circulating reservoir was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative outgrowth assay (Q2VOA) at entry and after 6 months, prior to ATI. Although there were no significant quantitative changes in the size of the reservoir, the composition of circulating reservoir clones varied over the 6_month period before treatment interruption in a manner that did not correlate with antibody sensitivity. The neutralization profile obtained from the reservoir by Q2VOA was predictive of time to rebound after ATI, and thus of antibody efficacy. Although 3BNC117 binding site amino acid variants found in rebound viruses pre_existed in the latent reservoir, only 3 of 217 rebound viruses were identical to 868 latent viruses. Instead many of the rebound viruses appeared to be recombinants, even in individuals with resistant reservoir viruses. By incorporating the possibility of recombination, 63% of the rebound viruses could have derived from the observed latent reservoir. In conclusion, viruses emerging during ATI in individuals treated with 3BNC117 are not the dominant species found in the circulating reservoir, but instead appear to represent recombinants.Summary In the setting of a clinical trial evaluating the anti_HIV_1 antibody 3BNC117, Cohen et al. demonstrate that rebound viruses that emerge following interruption of antiretroviral therapy are distinct from circulating latent viruses. However, rebound viruses often appear to be recombinants between isolated latent viruses.",2725,206,666,42

However, therapies have limited efficacy in adult patients with amblyopia. Fluoxetine can reinstate early-life critical period-like neuronal plasticity and has been used to recover functional vision in adult rats with amblyopia. This phase 2, randomized, double-blind (fluoxetine vs. placebo), multicenter clinical trial examined whether or not fluoxetine can improve visual acuity in amblyopic adults. This interventional trial included 42 participants diagnosed with moderate to severe amblyopia. Subjects were randomized to receive either 20 mg fluoxetine (n=22) or placebo (n=20). During the 10-week treatment period, all subjects performed daily computerized perceptual training and eye patching. There was no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups. Visual acuity at the primary endpoint had significantly improved over baseline in both the fluoxetine (−0.167 logMAR) and placebo (−0.194 logMAR) groups (both p &lt; 0.001). Because patching alone is not effective in adults, the visual acuity improvement likely resulted from perceptual training. There was a positive correlation between visual acuity improvement and the perceptual training time. While this study failed to provide evidence that fluoxetine enhances neuroplasticity, our data support the usefulness of perceptual training for vision improvement in adults with amblyopia.",1983,147,731,29

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluations suggested that rifampicin doses higher than 13 mg/kg intravenously or 20 mg/kg orally (as previously studied) are warranted to maximize treatment response.Methods In a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we assigned 60 adult TBM patients in Bandung, Indonesia, to standard 450 mg, 900 mg or 1350 mg (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) oral rifampicin combined with other TB drugs for 30 days. Endpoints included pharmacokinetic measures, adverse events and survival.Results A double and triple dose of oral rifampicin led to three and five-fold higher geometric mean total exposures in plasma in the critical early days (2±1) of treatment (AUC0-24h: 53·5 mg.h/L vs 170·6 mg.h/L vs. 293·5 mg.h/L, p&lt;0·001), with proportional increases in CSF concentrations and without an increase in the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events.

Kendrick, Benjamin Becker",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/308924 ,"Deficient emotion regulation and exaggerated anxiety represent a major transdiagnostic psychopathological marker. On the neural level these deficits have been closely linked to impaired, yet treatment-sensitive, prefrontal regulatory control over the amygdala. Gaining direct control over these pathways could therefore provide an innovative and promising strategy to regulate exaggerated anxiety. To this end the current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-informed real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. In a randomized within-subject sham-controlled design high anxious subjects (n = 26) underwent real-time fMRI-guided training to enhance connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the amygdala (target pathway) during threat exposure. Maintenance of regulatory control was assessed after three days and in the absence of feedback. Training-induced changes in functional connectivity of the target pathway and anxiety ratings served as primary outcomes. Training of the target, yet not the sham-control, pathway significantly increased amygdala-vlPFC connectivity and decreased subjective anxiety levels. On the individual level stronger connectivity increases were significantly associated with anxiety reduction. At follow-up, volitional control over the target pathway and decreased anxiety level were maintained in the absence of feedback. The present results demonstrate for the first time that successful self-regulation of amygdala-prefrontal top-down regulatory circuits may represent a novel strategy to control anxiety. As such, the present findings underscore both the critical contribution of amygdala-prefrontal circuits to emotion regulation and the therapeutic potential of connectivity-informed real-time neurofeedback.",2638,187,1095,20

This multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial evaluated the impact of the 2 x daily use of a HAP dentifrice without fluoride on the progression of enamel caries in adolescent caries-risk patients subjected to orthodontic therapy, with a fluoridated AmF/SnF dentifrice serving as a positive control. Primary study outcome was the occurrence of enamel caries lesions ≥ ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment System) code 1 around orthodontic brackets on the vestibular surfaces of teeth 15-25 within the 168 days observation period. Secondary study outcomes were the occurrence of enamel caries lesion ≥ ICDAS code 2, Plaque Index (PlI) and Gingival Index (GI). Out of 150 recruited patients, 147 were included in the intent to treat analysis (ITT); 133 finished the study per protocol (PP). PP data analysis revealed the occurrence of enamel caries ≥ ICDAS code 1 in 54.7% of the HAP group patients compared to 60.9% of the fluoride control. In the ITT analysis the corresponding numbers were 56.8% (HAP) and 61.6% (control). Non-inferiority testing of the ITT as well as the PP data set proved that the caries preventive efficacy of the HAP dentifrice was not inferior to the protection provided by the fluoridated AmF/SnF control. Regarding all assessed secondary outcomes (enamel caries ≥ ICDAS code 2, GI, PlI) no significant differences between both experimental groups were observed. Within the restraints set by design and study population of this trial microcrystalline HAP as ingredient of toothpaste may thus be regarded a promising supplement to fluorides in clinical caries prevention (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02705456).",3548,286,1695,30

We sought to address surgical trauma related muscle injuries using local intraoperative application of allogeneic placenta-derived, mesenchymal-like adherent cells (PLX-PAD), using hip arthroplasty as a standardized injury model, because of the high regenerative and immunomodulatory potency of this cell type.Methods Our pilot phase I/IIa study was prospective, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled. Twenty patients undergoing hip arthroplasty via a direct lateral approach were injected with 3.0×108 or 1.5×108 PLX-PAD or a placebo into the gluteus medius muscle.Results We did not observe any relevant PLX-PAD-related adverse events at the 2-year follow-up. Improved gluteus medius strength was noted as early as week 6 in the treatment-groups. Surprisingly, until week 26 the low-dose outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared to placebo, mirrored by an increase in muscle volume. Histology indicated accelerated healing after cell therapy. Biomarker studies revealed that low-dose treatment reduced the surgery-related immunological stress reaction more than high-dose. Signs of late-onset immune reactivity after high-dose treatment corresponded to reduced functional improvement.Conclusion Allogeneic PLX-PAD therapy improved strength and volume of injured skeletal muscle with a reasonable safety profile.

Home-based online cognitive training may have to the potential to provide an efficient and effective way to improve attentional functions in such patients. Little work has been carried out to assess the efficacy of this approach in stroke patients, and the lack of studies with active control conditions and rigorous evaluations of cognitive functioning pre and post training means understanding is limited as to whether and how such interventions may be effective. Here we compare the effects of 20 days of active cognitive training using either novel Selective Attention Training (SAT) or commercial Working Memory Training (WMT) programme, versus a waitlist control group, on a wide range of attentional and working memory tasks, as well as on self-reported everyday functioning. We demonstrate separable effects of each of the active training conditions, with SAT leading to improvements in both spatial and non-spatial aspects of attention and WMT leading to improvements only on very closely related working memory tasks. Both training groups reported improvements in everyday functioning, which were associated with improvements in attentional functions, suggesting that improving attention may be of particular importance in maximising functional recovery in this patient group.",1485,205,564,45

Eligible patients with chronic low back pain (n=160) were randomised to an intervention or usual care control group. The intervention included brief advice, a clinical consultation and referral to a 6-month telephone-based healthy lifestyle coaching service. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index. Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs and work absenteeism costs. An economic analysis was performed from the societal perspective. Mean total costs were lower in the intervention group than the control group (-$614; 95%CI: -3133 to 255). The intervention group had significantly lower healthcare costs (-$292; 95%CI: -872 to -33), medication costs (-$30; 95%CI: -65 to -4) and absenteeism costs (-$1000; 95%CI: -3573 to -210). For all outcomes, the intervention was on average less expensive and more effective than usual care, and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared to usual care was relatively high (i.e. 0.81) at a willingness-to-pay of $0/unit of effect. However, the probability of cost-effectiveness was not as favourable among sensitivity analyses. The healthy lifestyle intervention seems to be cost-effective from the societal perspective.

Participants were randomised via one central randomisation schedule, to the intervention, or usual care. The intervention consisted of brief advice and referral to a 6-month telephone-based healthy lifestyle coaching service. Participants in the back pain trial were also offered a single physiotherapy consultation. The hypothesised primary mediator was self-reported weight, and alternative mediators were diet, physical activity, and pain beliefs. Outcomes were pain intensity, disability, and quality of life (QoL). Data were analysed using causal mediation analyses with sensitivity analyses for sequential ignorability. All mediation models were specified a priori. The intervention had no effect on pain intensity, disability or physical QoL. The intervention significantly improved mental QoL, however, the intervention effect was not channelled via the selected mediators. The intervention did not reduce weight, or the alternative mediators (diet, physical activity, pain beliefs), and these mediators were not associated with the outcomes (with one exception; poor diet was associated with lower mental QoL). The sensitivity analyses showed that our estimates were stable across all possible levels of residual confounding.

We hypothesized whether a mapping algorithm “Ripple-mapping” would be able to rapidly identify the areas of long-duration multicomponent electrograms which constitute the targets for ablation for an automated strategy.Methods Ripple-Mapping analysis was performed in all patients undergoing catheter ablation of Brugada syndrome in 2 centers. The activity propagation pattern determined by Ripple-Mapping was assessed, and areas of long duration potentials identified by visual inspection. The area of interest with long-duration potentials was correlated with the location of the ablation lesions.Results Detection of long duration potentials was possible in all four patients in this analysis. Points marking the ablation area in 2 patients were a perfect match to abnormal areas identified by Ripple-mapping. However, in 2 patients Ripple-mapping identified additional sites of long duration potentials which were not ablated. Acute and mid-term normalization of the ECG pattern was observed in three patients, and all these were free from arrhythmia relapse during a 10.3±3.2 months follow-up. In one patient, who had no ECG normalization and had arrhythmia relapse, the ablated area corresponded to &lt;25% of the Ripple-map region of interest.Conclusions This study shows the potential use of Ripple-mapping for identifying areas of long duration multicomponent electrograms in patients with Brugada syndrome and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. This technique enables the rapid definition of an area of interest which should then be validated by the operator before performing ablation with an end-point of ECG normalisation.",1669,152,555,19

We recently reported that glycemic control in patients with T2D can be significantly improved through a continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis. The purpose of this study was to examine CVD risk factors in this cohort.MethodsWe investigated CVD risk factors in patients with T2D who participated in a one year open label, non-randomized, controlled study. The CCI group (n = 262) received treatment from a health coach and medical provider. A usual care (UC) group (n = 87) was independently recruited to track customary T2D progression. Circulating biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, blood pressure (BP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), multi-factorial risk scores and medication use were examined.ResultsThe CCI group consisted of 262 patients (baseline mean(SD): age 54(8) y, BMI 40.4(8.8) kg/m2). Intention-to-treat analysis (% change) revealed the following at 1-year with P values &lt; 0.0019 indicating statistical significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons: total LDL-particles (LDL-P) (−4.9%, P=0.02), small LDL-P (−20.8%, P=1.2×10−12), LDL-P size (+1.1%, P=6.0×10−10), ApoB (−1.6%, P=0.37), ApoA1 (+9.8%, P&lt;10−16), ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (−9.5%, P=1.9×10−7), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (−29.1%, P&lt;10−16), large VLDL-P (−38.9%, P=4.2×10−15), and LDL-C (+9.9%, P=4.9×10−5). Additional effects were reductions in blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count (all P&lt;1×10−7) while cIMT was unchanged. The 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score decreased −11.9% (P=4.9×10−5). Antihypertensive medication use was discontinued in 11.4 % of CCI participants (P=5.3×10−5). The UC group of 87 patients (baseline mean(SD): age 52(10)y, BMI 36.7(7.2) kg/m2) showed no significant changes. After adjusting for baseline differences when comparing CCI and UC groups, significant improvements for the CCI group included small LDL-P, ApoA1, triglyceride/HDL-C ratio, HDL-C, hs-CRP, and ASCVD score. The CCI group showed a greater rise in LDL-C.ConclusionsA continuous care treatment including nutritional ketosis in patients with T2D improved most biomarkers of CVD risk after one year.

For tumors that lack actionable drivers, extensive molecular characterization and pre-clinical drug efficacy studies will be required to match patients with the appropriate targeted therapy. A cell line maintained at low passage and a patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) were generated using a fresh biopsy from a patient with a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary origin. Next-generation sequencing, high throughput signaling network analysis, and drug efficacy trials were then conducted to identify actionable targets for therapeutic intervention. No actionable mutations were identified after whole exome sequencing of the patient’s DNA; however, whole genome sequencing revealed amplification of the 3q and 5p chromosomal arms, that include the PIK3CA and RICTOR genes, respectively. Consistent with amplification of these genes, pathway analysis revealed activation of the AKT pathway. Based on this analysis, efficacy of PIK3CA and AKT inhibitors were evaluated in the tumor biopsy-derived cell culture and PDX, and response to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 was observed both in vitro and in vivo indicating the patient would benefit from targeted therapies directed against the serine/threonine kinase AKT.

Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) can diagnose genetic disorders in time to change acute medical or surgical management (clinical utility) and improve outcomes in acutely ill infants.METHODS Retrospective cohort study of acutely ill inpatient infants in a regional children’s hospital from July 2016–March 2017. Forty-two families received rWGS for etiologic diagnosis of genetic disorders. Probands received standard genetic testing as clinically indicated. Primary end-points were rate of diagnosis, clinical utility, and healthcare utilization. The latter was modelled in six infants by comparing actual utilization with matched historical controls and/or counterfactual utilization had rWGS been performed at different time points.FINDINGS The diagnostic sensitivity was 43% (eighteen of 42 infants) for rWGS and 10% (four of 42 infants) for standard of care (P=.0005). The rate of clinical utility for rWGS (31%, thirteen of 42 infants) was significantly greater than for standard of care (2%, one of 42; P=.0015). Eleven (26%) infants with diagnostic rWGS avoided morbidity, one had 43% reduction in likelihood of mortality, and one started palliative care. In six of the eleven infants, the changes in management reduced inpatient cost by $800, 000 to $2,000,000.DISCUSSION These findings replicate a prior study of the clinical utility of rWGS in acutely ill inpatient infants, and demonstrate improved outcomes and net healthcare savings. rWGS merits consideration as a first tier test in this setting.",4013,224,784,21

Prior to this study, CHH utilized the St. John’s Sepsis Agent (SJSA) as a rules-based sepsis detection system.Methods The Predictive algoRithm for EValuation and Intervention in SEpsis (PREVISE) study was carried out between July 1, 2017 and August 30, 2017. All patients over the age of 18 who were admitted to the emergency department or intensive care units at CHH were monitored during the study. We assessed pre-implementation baseline metrics during the month of July, 2017, when the SJSA was active. During implementation in the month of August, 2017, SJSA and the MLA concurrently monitored patients for sepsis risk. At the conclusion of the study period, the primary outcome of sepsis-related in-hospital mortality and secondary outcome of sepsis-related hospital length of stay were compared between the two groups.Results Sepsis-related in-hospital mortality decreased from 3.97% to 2.64%, a 33.5% relative decrease (P = 0.038), and sepsis-related length of stay decreased from 2.99 days in the pre-implementation phase to 2.48 days in the post-implementation phase, a 17.1% relative reduction (P &lt; 0.001).Conclusion Reductions in patient mortality and length-of-stay were observed with use of a machine learning algorithm for early sepsis detection in the emergency department and intensive care units at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and may present a method for improving patient outcomes.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03235193, retrospectively registered on July 27th 2017.",4088,600,2214,13

Regulatory T cells (Tregs), that prevent autoimmunity, require Interleukin-2 (IL-2) for maintenance of immunosuppressive functions and, alterations in the IL-2 pathway predispose to T1D. Using an adaptive trial design we aimed to determine the optimal regimen of aldesleukin (recombinant human IL-2) to physiologically enhance Tregs while limiting expansion of autoreactive Teffs.Methods DILfrequency is a single-center, non-randomised, open-label, response-adaptive study of participants aged 18 to 70 years with T1D. The initial learning phase allocated 12 participants to six different predefined dose-frequency regimens. Then, three cohorts of 8 participants were sequentially allocated dose-frequencies, based on repeated interim analyses of all accumulated trial data. The co-primary endpoints were percentage change in Tregs, Teffs and, CD25 (α subunit of the IL-2 receptor) expression by Tregs, from baseline to steady state. Trial registration ISRCTN40319192 and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02265809).Findings 115 participants were assessed between November 17th 2014 and May 22nd 2016, 38 participants were enrolled with 36 completing treatment. The optimal regimen to maintain a steady state increase in Tregs of 30% and CD25 expression of 25% without Teff expansion is 0.26 × 106 IU/m2 (95% CI (−0.007 to 0.485)) every 3 days (1.3 to 4.4). Tregs and CD25 were dose-frequency responsive, while Teffs were not. The commonest adverse event was injection site reaction (464/694 events), with a single participant developing transient eosinophilia at the highest dose (0.47 × 106 IU/m2).Interpretation This response-adaptive trial defined a well-tolerated aldesleukin regimen that specifically induces Treg expansion that can now be trialled to treat T1D.Funding Sir Jules Thorn Trust, Wellcome, JDRF, SNSF, NIHR",2892,200,668,22

Age at diagnosis (median in cases 25 days, range 14-90 days vs median in controls 130 days, range 37-451) and time to diagnosis (median in cases thirteen days, range 1-84 days vs median in controls 107 days, range 21-429 days) were significantly less in cases than controls (p=0.04).CONCLUSIONS rWGS increased the proportion of infants in a regional NICU and PICU who received a timely diagnosis of a genetic disease. Additional, adequately powered studies are needed to determine whether accelerated diagnosis is associated with improved outcomes in this setting.

Chen, Anne Eaton, Melanie Jaeb, Kyle D. Rudser, James D. Neaton, Alvaro Alonso",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/215319 ,"Background Magnesium is believed to have a physiologic role in cardiac contractility, and evidence from epidemiologic and clinical studies has suggested that low serum concentrations of magnesium may be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF).Objective As part of the planning effort for a large randomized trial to prevent AF with magnesium supplementation, we conducted a 12-week pilot study to assess adherence to oral magnesium supplementation and matching placebo, estimate the effect on circulating magnesium concentrations, and evaluate the feasibility of using an ambulatory monitoring device (ZioPatch) for assessing premature atrial contractions (PACs), a predictor of AF.Design Double-blind randomized pilot clinical trial comparing supplementation with 400 mg magnesium oxide daily (versus placebo) over 12 weeks of follow-up. The ZioPatch was applied for 14 days at baseline and the end of follow-up. Adherence to the assigned treatment, and changes in PACs, serum magnesium concentration, glucose and blood pressure were assessed.Results A total of 59 participants, 73% women and average age 62 years, were randomized. 98% of participants completed follow-up. Those assigned to the magnesium supplement took 75% of tablets as compared to 83% for those in the placebo group. Change in magnesium concentrations was significantly greater for those given magnesium supplement compared to placebo (0.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.12 mEq/L; p = 0.002). ZioPatch was worn for an average of 13.0 of the requested 14 days at baseline; at the end of follow-up, the average number of days of monitoring was 13.0 days for the magnesium supplement group and 12.7 days for the placebo group. For log PAC burden (episodes per hour), the average change from baseline was −0.05 (95% CI: −0.31, 0.20) for those randomized to magnesium supplement and 0.04 (95% CI: −0.24, 0.31) for those randomized to placebo (p=0.79 for difference). Gastrointestinal problems were reported by 50% of participants in the magnesium supplement group and 7% in the placebo group. Only one person in the magnesium supplement group and none in the placebo group experienced adverse events which led to treatment discontinuation.Conclusions In this pilot randomized clinic trial, although gastrointestinal side effects to the magnesium supplement were common, adherence, measured by pill counts, was very good and, as a consequence, magnesium concentrations were greater for those randomly assigned to the magnesium supplement compared to placebo. Participant acceptance of the planned monitoring with ZioPatch was also very good. While the difference in the change in PACs was not significant, this pilot study was small, short-term, and did not include participants at high risk of AF. Thus, we could not reliably evaluate the effect of magnesium supplementation on PACs.Clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT02837328",1845,152,726,18
86,An interventional Soylent diet increases the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio in human gut microbiome communities: a randomized controlled trial,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/200881v1,"Ryan H.

Arkin",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/200881 ,"Our knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health has rapidly expanded in recent years. Diet has been shown to have causative effects on microbiome composition, which can have subsequent implications on health. Soylent 2.0 is a liquid meal replacement drink that satisfies nearly 20% of all recommended daily intakes per serving. This study aims to characterize the changes in gut microbiota composition resulting from a short-term Soylent diet. Fourteen participants were separated into two groups: 5 in the regular diet group and 9 in the Soylent diet group. The regular diet group maintained a diet closely resembling self-reported regular diets. The Soylent diet group underwent three dietary phases: A) a regular diet for 2 days, B) a Soylent-only diet (five servings of Soylent daily and water as needed) for 4 days, and C) a regular diet for 4 days. Daily logs self-reporting diet, Bristol stool ratings, and any abdominal discomfort were electronically submitted. Eight fecal samples per participant were collected using fecal sampling kits, which were subsequently sent to uBiome, Inc. for sample processing and V4 16S rDNA sequencing. Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and taxonomically identified against the GreenGenes 16S database. We find that an individual’s alpha-diversity is not significantly altered during a Soylent-only diet. In addition, principal coordinate analysis using the unweighted UniFrac distance metric shows samples cluster strongly by individual and not by dietary phase. Among Soylent dieters, we find a significant increase in the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes abundance, which is associated with several positive health outcomes, including reduced risks of obesity and intestinal inflammation.",9510,403,2489,24

In order to further test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel-arm, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. Patients received a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. Changes in depression severity were assessed with the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D). Assessments were made at baseline, and at one (D1), two (D2) and seven (D7) days after dosing. We observed significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca when compared to placebo at all timepoints. MADRS scores were significantly lower in the ayahuasca group compared to placebo (at D1 and D2: p=0.04; and at D7: p&lt;0.0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1: Cohen’ s d=0.84; D2: Cohen’ s d=0.84; D7: Cohen’ s d=1.49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7 (64% vs. 27%; p=0.04), while remission rate was marginally significant at D7 (36% vs. 7%, p=0.054). To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test a psychedelic substance in treatment-resistant depression. Overall, this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of ayahuasca, dosed within an appropriate setting, to help treat depression.",26424,776,5809,10

Long-term links to allergy and obesity are also suggested. We devised a product, DAV132, and previously showed its ability to deliver a powerful adsorbent, activated charcoal, in the late ileum of human volunteers.Methods We performed a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02176005) in 28 human volunteers treated with a 5-day clinical regimen of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic moxifloxacin in two parallel groups, with or without DAV132 co-administration. Two control goups of 8 volunteers each receiving DAV132 alone, or a non-active substitute, were added.Results The co-administration of DAV132 decreased free moxifloxacin fecal concentrations by 99%, while plasmatic levels were unaffected. Shotgun quantitative metagenomics showed that the richness and composition of the intestinal microbiota were largely preserved in subjects co-treated with DAV132 in addition to moxifloxacin. No adverse effect was observed. In addition, DAV132 efficiently adsorbed a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotics ex-vivo.Conclusions DAV132 was highly effective to protect the gut microbiome of moxifloxacin - treated healthy volunteers and may constitute a clinical breakthrough by preventing adverse health consequences of a wide range of antibiotic treatments.",4743,178,3456,31

Horst, Sharity Ludwig, Marilynn Rothen, Benjamin W. Chaffee, Svetlana Lyalina, Katherine S. Pollard, Joseph L. DeRisi, Lloyd Mancl",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/131870 ,"Objectives: The Stopping Cavities Trial investigated effectiveness and safety of 38% silver diamine fluoride in arresting caries lesions.Materials and Methods: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. Oregon preschools. 66 preschool children with ≥1 lesion. 38% silver diamine fluoride or placebo (blue-tinted water), applied topically to the lesion. The primary endpoint was caries arrest (lesion inactivity, Nyvad criteria) 14-21 days post intervention. Dental plaque was collected from all children, and microbial composition was assessed by RNA sequencing from 2 lesions and 1 unaffected surface before treatment and at follow-up for 3 children from each group.Results and Conclusion: Mean fraction of arrested caries lesions in the silver diamine fluoride group was higher (0.72; 95% CI; 0.55, 0.84) than in the placebo group (0.05; 95% CI; 0.00, 0.16). Confirmatory analysis using generalized estimating equation log-linear regression, accounting for the number of treated surfaces and length of follow-up, indicated the fraction of arrested caries was significantly higher in the treatment group (relative risk, 17.3; 95% CI: 4.3 to 69.4). No harms were observed. RNA sequencing analysis identified no consistent changes in relative abundance of caries-associated microbes, nor emergence of antibiotic or metal resistance gene expression. Topical 38% silver diamine fluoride was effective and safe in arresting cavities in preschool children. The treatment is applicable to primary care practice and may reduce the burden of untreated tooth decay in the population.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02536040.Clinical Significance In this clinical trial, 72% of caries lesions were arrested by silver diamine fluoride, with no harms. Contrary to the presumed antibacterial mechanism, lesion bacterial composition changed negligibly. This simple topical treatment is applicable to primary care practice and may reduce the burden of untreated tooth decay in the population.",3537,234,1596,30

Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.Results Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A, 14 in Arm B). All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia. Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data. Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms. MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients. DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21. Unlike end-point marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, one week prior to the patient’s marrow aspirate confirming non-response. Decitabine-induced effects of end-induction marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation and gene expression comparison with matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.Conclusions This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML. Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations. The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission. Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.

However, the availability, quality, and general funding for early intervention programs is often lacking, leaving newly diagnosed children without adequate and sufficient therapy during the most critical early period of their development. Parent-administered iPad-assisted therapy has the potential to reduce the gap between the amount of therapy recommended for children with ASD and the amount they receive. However it is unclear how ASD severity and age influence a child’s ability to engage with and learn from computerized cognitive exercises. In this manuscript, we describe data from a tablet-based therapeutic application administered by parents to 1,514 young children with ASD over the course of four to twelve months. We report that older children and children with milder forms of ASD performed better and progressed faster in cognitive and language exercises. However, most children were able to engage with and learn from exercises independent of their age or ASD severity. This data confirm that tablet-based cognitive and language exercises can be successfully administered by parents to children as young as two years of age over the course of many months independent of ASD severity.",2500,241,652,30

Gabashvili,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/139014 ,"Human breath and body odors have been used for diagnosis of serious and life-threatening conditions since the dawn of medical practice. More recently, it has been recognized that malodors without accompanying physical symptoms could be a sign of psychologically but not physically debilitating disorders such as Trimethylaminuria (TMAU). Self-reported intermittent odors without apparent cause, are, however, still treated with suspicion by medical professionals. Most cases of socially-disabling idiopathic malodor remain undiagnosed and there are no guidelines for diagnostic tests nor treatment options that extend beyond TMAU. Internationally-recruited volunteers with undiagnosed body odor and halitosis enrolled to participate in our study, registered as NCT02692495 at clinicaltrials.gov. Each volunteer underwent several blood and urine tests conducted by Biolab Medical Unit, a medical referral laboratory in London, specializing in nutritional and environmental medicine. Intestinal permeability measurements were strikingly different for subjects that named the nose/mouth as the malodor source(s) versus other, often unidentified, body regions. Furthermore, metabolite levels in blood and urine allowed matching of participants by dietary sensitivities and the type of odor reported, emphasizing the potential of harnessing patients’ olfactory observations.

A total of 330 women (median age 38.2 years) who were undergoing IVF at our clinic were enrolled.Results Serum estradiol (E2) levels were 267.71 pg/ml in Premarin group, 391.22 pg/ml in Estrogel group and 495.12 pg/ml in Estrana tape group. Therefore, serum E2 levels in Estrana tape group were higher than those of the other two groups (P&lt;0.01). The pregnancy rate in the Estrogel group was higher than that in the Premarin group (30.0% versus 17.3%, P=0.026, odds ratio 2.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.09–3.87).

Topol",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/029983 ,"Background Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and consumers – some of which have been shown to lead to improved health management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system.Methods We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a 2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that corresponded to their condition(s) and an iPhone with linked tracking applications for a period of 6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program. Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health management system which provided participants detailed device tracking information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader, health care provider, and employee wellness program – making it both unique and inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also examined health-self management.Results &amp; Conclusions There was little evidence of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital medicine technologies. Among secondary outcomes there was some evidence of improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the intervention group.Disclosure of Funding This research is funded in part by a NIH/NCATS flagship Clinical and Translational Science Award Grant (1UL1 TR001114), Qualcomm Foundation Scripps Health Digital Medicine Research Grant, and Scripps Health’s Division of Innovation and Human Capital and Division of Scripps Genomic Medicine.
