Numerous studies show that the control of whisking has anticipatory aspects. For example, rodents target their whisker protraction to the distance at which they expect objects, rather than just reacting fast to contacts with unexpected objects. Here we characterize the anticipatory control of whisking in rodents as an active inference process. In this perspective, the rodent is endowed with a prior belief that it will touch something at the end of the whisker protraction, and it continuously modulates its whisking amplitude to minimize (proprioceptive and somatosensory) prediction errors arising from an unexpected whisker-object contact, or from a lack of an expected contact. We will use the model to qualitatively reproduce key empirical findings about the ways rodents modulate their whisker amplitude during exploration and the scanning of (expected or unexpected) objects. Furthermore, we will discuss how the components of active inference model can in principle map to the neurobiological circuits of rodent whisking.",942,42,111,15.0

Ripples detected in CA1 have lower frequency in aged compared to young rats. Although CA1 ripples are theorized to manifest from CA3, ripple dynamics in CA3 have not been examined in aged animals. The current study obtained simultaneous recordings between CA1 and CA3 in young and aged rats to examine sharp-wave/ripple characteristics in both regions in relation to age. While CA1 ripple frequency was reduced with age, there were no age differences in CA3 ripples. In aged, but not young, rats there was also a significant increase in the probability of CA3 and CA1 ripples co-occurring between the pre- and post-behavior rest epochs. Moreover, in both age groups, CA1 ripples that co-occurred with a CA3 ripple had increased frequency, power, and duration. These findings suggest age differences in CA1 are not due to altered afferent input from CA3, but instead reflect distinct mechanisms of ripple generation with age.HIGHLIGHTSCA1 ripple frequency is reduced with age.CA3 ripple characteristics do not change with age.In aged rats only, CA3-CA1 ripple co-occurrence increased following behavior.CA1 ripples that co-occurred with CA3 had greater frequency, power, and duration.",65,2,4,37.0

Therefore, reducing animal stress by providing proper breeding environment and environmental enrichment can be the basis for animal study. In this study, the stress level was assessed according to the mouse breeding environment. According to the results of the experiment, it was determined that the individual ventilation cage had less cortisol concentration in serum and body weight increased in the individual ventilation cage than individual isolated cage, when providing environmental enrichment rather than group breeding or not providing environmental enrichment. The results will provide appropriate guidelines for laboratory animal welfare.",53,4,3,13.0
3,Discriminating predation attempt outcomes during natural foraging using the post-buzz pause in Japanese large-footed bat Myotis macrodactylus,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.27.457998v1,"Yuuka Mizuguchi, Emyo Fujioka, Olga Heim, Dai Fukui, Shizuko Hiryu",2021.08.27.457998;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.27.457998,"Bats emit a series of echolocation calls with an increasing repetition rate (the terminal buzz), when attempting to capture prey. This is often used as an acoustic indicator of prey-capture attempts. However, because it is directly linked to foraging efficiency, predation success is a more useful measure than predation attempts in ecological research. The characteristics of echolocation calls that consistently signify predation success across different situations have not been identified. Due to additional influencing factors, identification of these characteristics is particularly challenging for wild bats foraging in their natural environment compared to those in flight chambers. This study documented the natural foraging behavior of wild Japanese large-footed bat Myotis macrodactylus using synchronized acoustic and video recordings. From the video recordings, we could assign 137 attacks to three outcome categories: prey captured (51.8%), prey dropped (29.2%), and failed attempt (19%). Based on previous indications from laboratory studies that the length of the silent interval following the terminal buzz (post-buzz pause) might reflect the prey capture outcome, we compared post-buzz pause durations among categories of attack outcomes. The post-buzz pause was longest in the case of successful capture, suggesting that the length of the post-buzz pause is a useful acoustic indicator of predation success during natural foraging in M. macrodactylus. Our finding will advance the study of bat foraging behavior using acoustic data, including estimations of foraging efficiency and analyses of feeding habitat quality.Summary statement We investigated the natural foraging behavior of wild Myotis macrodactylus and found that the length of the post-buzz pause is a useful acoustic indicator of predation success.",58,4,4,24.0

These variants are potentially treatable with pharmacological chaperones, such as a competitive HGSNAT inhibitor, glucosamine. Since the constitutive HGSNAT knockout mice, we generated previously cannot be used to test such strategy in vivo, we generated a novel model, the HgsnatP304L strain, expressing misfolded mutant HGSNAT with human missense mutation Pro311Leu (Pro304Leu in the mouse enzyme).Results HgsnatP304L mice present deficits in short-term (novel object recognition test) and working/spatial (Y-maze test) memory at 4 months of age, 2-4 months earlier than previously described gene-targeted Hgsnat-Geo mice, which lack HGSNAT protein. HgsnatP304L mice also show increased severity of synaptic deficits in CA1 neurons, and accelerated course of CNS pathology including neuronal storage of heparan sulfate, accumulation of misfolded proteins, increase of simple gangliosides, and neuroinflammation as compared with Hgsnat-Geo mice. Expression of misfolded human Pro311Leu HGSNAT protein in cultured hippocampal Hgsnat- Geo neurons aggravated reduction of synaptic proteins. Memory deficits and majority of pathological changes in the brain were rescued in mice receiving daily doses of oral glucosamine.Interpretation Altogether, our data for the first time demonstrate dominant-negative effects of the misfolded HGSNAT Pro304Leu variant and show that these effects are treatable by oral administration of glucosamine, suggesting that patients, affected with missense mutations preventing normal folding of the enzyme, could benefit from chaperone therapy.",51,4,18,66.0

However, animals risk making recognition mistakes because the signal properties of different individuals often overlap due to within-individual variation in signal production. To understand the relationship between signal variation and decision rules for social recognition, we studied male golden rocket frogs, which recognize the calls of territory neighbors and respond less aggressively to a neighbor’s calls than to the calls of strangers. We quantified patterns of individual variation in acoustic properties of calls and predicted optimal discrimination thresholds using a signal detection theory model of receiver utility that incorporated signal variation, the payoffs of correct and incorrect decisions, and the rates of encounters with neighbors and strangers. We then experimentally determined thresholds for discriminating between neighbors and strangers using a habituation-discrimination experiment with territorial males in the field. Males required a threshold difference between 9% and 12% to discriminate between calls differing in temporal properties; this threshold matched those predicted by a signal detection theory model under ecologically realistic assumptions of infrequent encounters with strangers and relatively costly missed detections of strangers. We demonstrate empirically that receivers group continuous variation in vocalizations into discrete social categories and show that signal detection theory can be applied to investigate evolved decision rules.",48,2,2,38.0

Drawing on elementary invariance principles, we propose that a statistical geometric object, the probability distribution of the normalized contour curvatures (NCC) in the intensity field of a planar image, has the potential to represent and classify categories of objects. We show that NCC is sufficient for discriminating between cognitive categories such as animacy, size and type, and demonstrate the robustness of this metric to variation in illumination and viewpoint, consistent with neurobiological constraints and psychological experiments. A generative model for producing artificial images with the observed NCC distributions highlights the key features that our metric captures and just as importantly, those that it does not. More broadly, our study points to the need for statistical geometric approaches to cognition that build in both the statistics and the natural invariances of the sensory world.",48,2,4,11.0

RL models consider any response type indiscriminately, ranging from less  choices (e.g. pressing a key with the index finger), to more  choices that can be executed in a number of ways (e.g. getting dinner at the restaurant). But does the learning process vary as a function of how  the choices are? In Experiment 1, we show that choice ion impacts learning: participants were slower and less accurate in learning to select a more  choice. Using computational modeling, we show that two mechanisms contribute to this. First, the values of motor actions interfered with the values of more  responses, resulting in more incorrect choices; second, information integration for relevant  choices was slower. In Experiment 2, we replicate the findings from Experiment 1, and further extend the results by investigating whether slowed learning is attributable to working memory (WM) or RL contributions. We find that the impairment in more /flexible choices is driven primarily by a weaker contribution of WM. We conclude that defining a more  choice space used by multiple learning systems recruits limited executive resources, limiting how much such processes then contribute to fast learning.",54,2,4,39.0

We conducted an acoustic playback experiment combined with passive acoustic monitoring and visual observations to test the function of the whup on a Southeast Alaskan foraging ground. Using a before-during-after design, we broadcasted either a control sound or a unique whup call sequence. We investigated the change in whup rates (whups/whale/10 minutes) in response to treatment (whup or control) and period (before, during, or after). In 100% of the conspecific trials, whup rates increased during broadcasts, and whup rates were significantly higher than in before or after periods. There was no significant difference in whup rates between before and after periods during conspecific trials. In control trials, there were no significant differences in whup rates between before, during, or after periods. Neither whups nor control playbacks elicited an approach response. Humpback whale vocal responses to whup playbacks suggest that whups function as a contact call, but not necessarily as an aggregation signal.",42,2,2,10.0

Carter",2020.08.02.232710;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.232710,"Permutation tests are widely used to test null hypotheses with animal social network data, but suffer from high rates of type I and II error when the permutations do not properly simulate the intended null hypothesis.Two common types of permutations each have limitations. Pre-network (or datastream) permutations can be used to control “nuisance effects” like spatial, temporal, or sampling biases, but only when the null hypothesis assumes random social structure. Node (or node-label) permutation tests can test null hypotheses that include nonrandom social structure, but only when nuisance effects do not shape the observed network.We demonstrate one possible solution addressing these limitations: using pre-network permutations to adjust the values for each node or edge before conducting a node permutation test. We conduct a range of simulations to estimate error rates caused by confounding effects of social or non-social structure in the raw data.Regressions on simulated datasets suggest that this “double permutation” approach is less likely to produce elevated error rates relative to using only node permutations, pre-network permutations, or node permutations with simple covariates, which all exhibit elevated type I errors under at least one set of simulated conditions. For example, in scenarios where type I error rates from pre-network permutation tests exceed 30%, the error rates from double permutation remain at 5%.The double permutation procedure provides one potential solution to issues arising from elevated type I and type II error rates when testing null hypotheses with social network data. We also discuss alternative approaches that can provide robust inference, including fitting mixed effects models, restricted node permutations, testing multiple null hypotheses, and splitting large datasets to generate replicated networks. Finally, we highlight ways that uncertainty can be explicitly considered and carried through the analysis.",2238,573,895,33.0

In eusocial insects, individual differences amongst workers in a colony play a central role division of labour and task allocation. Extensive empirical and theoretical work has highlighted variation in response thresholds as a proximate mechanism underlying individual behavioural differences and hence division of labour. However, other response parameters, like response probability and intensity, can affect these differences. In this study, we first extended a previously published agent-based model on honey bee foraging to understand the relative importance of response (dance) probability and response (dance) intensity in the task of recruitment. Comparing variation obtained from the simulations with previously published empirical data, we found that response intensity plays a more important role than probability in producing consistent inter-individual differences in recruitment behaviour. We then explored the benefits provided by this individual variation in recruitment behaviour to the colony’s collective foraging effort under different environmental conditions. Our results revealed that individual variation leads to a greater energetic yield per forager, but only when food is abundant. Our study highlights the need to consider all response parameters while studying division of labour and adds to the growing body of evidence linking individual variation in behavioural responses to the success of social groups.",37,4,8,34.0

Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent. Using THC in conventional-high doses may have deleterious effects. Therefore, we propose to use an ultra-low dose of THC (ULD-THC). We previously published that a single injection of ULD-THC elevated Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1) levels in the brain and ameliorated cognitive functioning in several models of brain injuries as well as in naturally aging mice. Our working hypothesis suggests that ULD-THC can prevent and even reverse AD pathology. In this preliminary study, we saw that a single injection of ULD-THC alleviated cognitive impairments of a mice model for AD, 5xFAD mice. Our work may establish the foundations for the development of a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of AD patients, thus, bringing the ULD-THC treatment closer to clinical application.",34,3,4,11.0

Our setup uses inexpensive components, is based on open-source motion tracking software, and is easy to assemble and use in the field. It runs off-grid, supports low-light tracking with infrared lights, and can implement arbitrary light cycle colours and brightnesses with programmable LEDs. We provide a user-friendly guide to assembling pLAM hardware and accessing its pre-configured software and guidelines for using it in other systems.We benchmarked pLAM for insects under various lab and field conditions, then compared results to a commercial activity detector. They offer broadly similar activity measures, but our setup captures flight and bouts of motion that are often missed by beam-breaking activity detection.pLAM will enable high-throughput quantification of small animal location and activity in a low-cost and accessible manner, crucial to studying behaviour that can help inform conservation and management decisions.",34,4,4,24.0

Four crows and nine chickens completed the cylinder task, eight crows and six chickens completed the reversal learning experiment. Crows performed better in the cylinder task compared to chickens. In the reversal learning experiment, species did not significantly differ in the number of trials until learning criterion was reached. Performance in the reversal learning experiment did not correlate with performance in the cylinder task in chickens. Our results suggest crows to possess better motor inhibitory control compared to chickens. In contrast, learning performance in a reversal learning task did not differ between the species, indicating similar levels of behavioural flexibility. Interestingly, we describe notable individual differences in performance.

Widely documented, these structures have historically been considered as byproducts of heavy traffic or aborted relocations of the ants’ temporary nest, or bivouac. However, we recently observed that caches of the hook-jawed army ant, Eciton hamatum, appeared independently from heavy traffic or bivouac relocations. In addition, the flow of prey through caches varied based on the quantity of prey items workers transported. As this suggested a potential adaptive function, we developed agent-based simulations to compare raids of caching and non-caching virtual army ants. We found that caches increased the amount of prey that relatively low numbers of raiders were able to retrieve. However, this advantage became less conspicuous - and generally disappeared - as the number of raiders increased. Based on these results, we hypothesize that caches maximize the amount of prey that limited amounts of raiders can retrieve, especially as prey colonies coordinately evacuate their brood. In principle, caches also allow workers to safely collect multiple prey items and efficiently transport them to the bivouac. Further field observations are needed to test this and other hypotheses emerging from our study.",1080,38,125,18.0

As contingencies are learned, behavioral variance can give-way to routines and stereotypies. This phenomenon is common across a range of learning systems, but has not been well studied in the social domain in which the stimulus an agent investigates, another individual, is reactive to the agent’s behaviors. We examined the effects of social novelty on interaction variability in laboratory-reared, female degus, known to readily express affiliative behaviors with initially unfamiliar, unrelated individuals. Degus were presented with a series of 20 minute, dyadic “reunion” sessions across days, interleaving exposures to familiar and unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics. We found that dyads could be distinguished from one-another by their interactive behaviors, suggesting dyad-specific social relationships. Following the first session, stranger dyads were unexpectedly easier to differentiate than cagemates due to a combination of higher diversity of behavior between dyads and, in some cases, lower variability within dyads. Some evidence could be found for higher variability in stranger interactions within the first two exposures, though within-session variability increased in cagemates across reunions, ultimately exceeding levels in strangers. We also observed that while strangers interacted more than cagemates, this could be traced to only 30% of the animals and the higher interaction levels did not attenuate over sessions or after co-housing the animals. No strong differences were observed in the temporal structure of social behavior between the two groups. Results reveal that new relationships in adult, female degus are more diverse but not more variable compared with established relationships, particularly after the first social exposure. Given known tendencies of female degus to form and maintain new relationships, these findings are consistent with the notion that higher interaction variability may be maladaptive to building social coordination and trust.",30,2,1,39.0

Computational models can account for specific behaviours but their applicability across sensory and task domains remains untested. Here we assess the capacity of our previous model explaining visual navigation to generalise to olfactory navigation and its coordination with other guidance in flies and ants. We show that fundamental to this capacity is the use of a biologically-realistic neural copy-and-shift mechanism that ensures sensory information is presented in a format compatible with the insect steering circuit regardless of its source. Moreover, the same mechanism is shown to transfer cues from unstable/egocentric to stable/geocentric frames of reference providing a first account of the mechanism by which foraging insects robustly recover from environmental disturbances. We propose that these circuits can be flexibly repurposed by different insect navigators to address their unique ecological needs.",31,2,3,24.0

Langmore",2021.08.18.456772;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.456772,"Many hosts of brood parasitic cuckoos reject foreign eggs from the nest. Yet where nests commonly receive more than one cuckoo egg, hosts might benefit by instead accepting parasite eggs. This is because cuckoos remove an egg from the nest before adding their own, and keeping cuckoo eggs in the nest reduces the odds that further host eggs are removed by subsequent cuckoos. This ‘clutch dilution effect’ has been proposed as a precondition for the evolution of cuckoo nestling eviction by hosts, but no previous studies have tested this in a host that rejects cuckoo nestlings. We tested the clutch dilution hypothesis in large-billed gerygones (Gerygone magnirostris), which are multiply parasitized by little bronze-cuckoos (Chalcites minutillus). Gerygones evict cuckoo nestlings but accept cuckoo eggs. Consistent with multiple parasitism favouring egg acceptance, we found gerygone egg survival was higher under scenarios of cuckoo egg acceptance than rejection. Yet gerygones were also flexible in their egg acceptance, with 35% abandoning cuckoo-egg-only clutches. This novel demonstration of adaptive clutch dilution suggests that multiple parasitism can favour a facultative response to brood parasite eggs, whereby hosts accept or reject parasite eggs depending on clutch composition.",30,2,2,14.0

Here, we explored the thought extramission model, which is the notion that thoughts emanate from the eyes in the form of visualized representations. We show that the eyes project thoughts a short distance away in the form of high-resolution conceptual maps whose structure collapses at great distances. We also demonstrate that sensory filtering of thought projection by reducing light contrast lowers the resolution of conceptual maps. Our results highlight the supporting role of the visual system for thought processes relying on contrast, luminance, and perspective formation.",31,3,1,17.0

Nowadays, there are no available treatments to ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome. We analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS. CD mice showed the characteristic hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling modulation with sub-chronic (10 d) JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice.

Breeding tenures are relatively short and competitive, with vacancies usually occurring following a breeder’s death, and are often filled by unrelated immigrants or by relatives of the previous breeder. The frequency and conditions of active breeder displacements are poorly understood. Position changes in the dominance hierarchy are common yet rarely documented in detail. We describe a turnover in male breeding position in a wolf pack by males from a neighboring pack in mid-summer 2016 in Yellowstone National Park. Over the course of two months, three males from the Mollie’s pack displaced the breeding male of the neighboring Wapiti Lake pack, joined the pack’s two adult females, and subsequently raised the previous male’s four approximately three-month old pups. In the four years following the displacement (2017 to 2020), at least one of the intruding males has successfully bred with the dominant female and most years with a subordinate female (who was one of the pups at the time of displacement). The pack reared pups to adulthood each year. Male breeding displacements are likely influenced by male-male competition and female mate choice. These changes are the result of individuals competing to improve breeding position and may lead to increased pack stability and greater reproductive success. We report in detail on the behavior of a closely observed breeding displacement and we discuss the adaptive benefits of the change.",31,4,6,35.0

It contributes to survival by endowing individuals and populations with the capacity to adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions. Intra-individual variability is thought to reflect both endogenous and exogenous modulations of the neural dynamics of the central nervous system. However, how variability is internally regulated and modulated by external cues remains elusive. Here we address this question by analyzing the statistics of spontaneous exploration of freely swimming zebrafish larvae, and by probing how these locomotor patterns are impacted when changing the water temperatures within an ethologically relevant range.Results We show that, for this simple animal model, five short-term kinematic parameters - interbout interval, turn amplitude, travelled distance, turn probability and orientational flipping rate - together control the long-term exploratory dynamics. We establish that the bath temperature consistently impacts the means of these parameters, but leave their pairwise covariance unchanged. These results indicate that the temperature merely controls the sampling statistics within a well-defined kinematic space delineated by this robust statistical structure. At a given temperature, individual animals explore the behavioral space over a timescale of tens of minutes, suggestive of a slow internal state modulation that could be externally biased through the bath temperature. By combining these various observations into a minimal stochastic model of navigation, we show that this thermal modulation of locomotor kinematics results in a thermophobic behavior, complementing direct gradient-sensing mechanisms.Conclusions This study establishes the existence of a well-defined locomotor space accessible to zebrafish larvae during spontaneous exploration, and quantifies self-generated modulation of locomotor patterns. Intra-individual variability reflects a slow diffusive-like probing of this space by the animal. The bath temperature in turn restricts the sampling statistics to sub-regions, endowing the animal with basic thermophobicity. This study suggests that in Zebrafish, as well as in other ectothermic animals, ambient temperature could be used to efficiently manipulate internal states in a simple and ethological way.",940,77,224,27.0

Here we describe a previously unknown jumping behavior in a group of beetle larvae (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae). We analyze and describe this behavior in Laemophloeus biguttatus and provide information on similar observations for another laemophloeid species, Placonotus testaceus. Laemophloeus biguttatus larvae prelude jumps by arching their body while gripping the substrate with their legs over a period of 0.22 ± 0.17s. This is followed by a rapid ventral curling of the body after the larvae releases its grip that launches them into the air. Larvae reached takeoff velocities of 0.47 ± 0.15 m s-1 and traveled 11.2 ± 2.8 mm (1.98 ± 0.8 body lengths) horizontally and 7.9 ± 4.3 mm (1.5 ± 0.9 body lengths) vertically during their jumps. Conservative estimates of power output revealed that not all jumps can be explained by direct muscle power alone, suggesting Laemophloeus biguttatus uses a latch-mediated spring actuation mechanism (LaMSA) in which interaction between the larvae’s legs and the substrate serves as the latch. MicroCT scans and SEM imaging of larvae did not reveal any notable modifications that would aid in jumping. Although more in-depth experiments could not be performed to test hypotheses on the function of these jumps, we posit that this behavior is used for rapid locomotion which is energetically more efficient than crawling the same distance to disperse from their ephemeral habitat. We also summarize and discuss jumping behaviors among insect larvae for additional context of this behavior in laemophloeid beetles.",37,5,10,45.0

While such interference competition is common in nectar-feeding birds, reports in nectar-feeding bats are rare. Glossophaga bats have been observed to temporarily defend flowers but the extent of this monopolization, its effects on nectar intake, and underlying sexual differences remain unknown. We investigated resource defense behavior of Glossophaga mutica in the laboratory. We presented bats with two patches of computer-controlled artificial flowers and tracked individual nectar intake. Furthermore, we established an automated method for detecting aggressive interactions at the artificial flowers. Theoretical models of interference competition predict more aggressive interactions when resources are spatially more clumped. To test this, we varied resource distribution across two patches from clumped to distributed and monitored bats’ interactions in one male, one female, and four mixed-sex groups. Males engaged in aggressive interactions more often than females and in each group some individuals defended clumped artificial flowers against others. Subordinate males experienced a substantial decrease in nectar intake, while females were only marginally affected by male aggression. These results suggest that aggressive interactions and their effect on nectar intake are sex-dependent in G. mutica. Furthermore, aggressive interactions were more frequent and resource defense was only successful when resources were clumped. Our experimental set-up allowed us to perform an automated test of models of interference competition with a mammal under controlled laboratory conditions. This approach may pave the way for similar studies with other animals.Lay summary Males bully other males to get more food, but only when food is easy to defend. When flowers are spread out nectar-feeding bats rarely engage in fights. However, when there are rich flowers in one spot and no flowers elsewhere, some males start attacking others, denying them access to the nectar. Females do not seem bothered by such male bullies, but when there are no males around, some females become bullies themselves.",36,2,8,26.0

However, environmental humidity is highly heterogeneous, and is likely to affect the detectability of floral humidity, potentially constraining the contexts in which it can be used as a salient communication pathway between plants and their pollinators. In this study, we use differential conditioning techniques on bumblebees Bombus terrestris audax (Harris) to explore the detectability of an elevated floral humidity signal when presented against different levels of environmental noise. Artificial flowers were constructed that could be either dry or humid, and individual bumblebees were presented with consistent rewards in either the humid or dry flowers presented in an environment with four levels of constant humidity, ranging from low (∼20% RH) to highly saturated (∼95% RH). Ability to learn was dependent upon both the rewarding flower type and the environment: the bumblebees were able to learn rewarding dry flowers in all environments, but their ability to learn humid rewarding flowers was dependent on the environmental humidity, and they were unable to learn humid rewarding flowers when the environment was highly saturated. This suggests that floral humidity might be masked from bumblebees in humid environments, suggesting that it may be a more useful signal to insect pollinators in arid environments.",28,2,1,17.0

When new exploitable sites are always available, a simple optimal strategy is to leave a current site when its return falls below a single average reward rate. Here, we examined foraging in a more structured environment, with a limited number of sites that replenished at different rates and had to be revisited. When participants could choose sites, they visited fast-replenishing sites more often, left sites at higher levels of reward, and achieved a higher net reward rate. Decisions to exploit-or-leave a site were best explained with a computational model that included both the average reward rate for the environment and reward information about the unattended sites. This suggests that unattended sites influence leave decisions, in foraging environments where sites can be revisited.HighlightsBeing able to select sites during foraging increased visits to high value sitesThis visitation pattern was efficient, producing higher average reward ratesDecisions to leave a site were influenced by information about alternative sites",1554,127,434,43.0

We tested gilts before mating, and during early and late pregnancy, by assessing their responses to ambiguous probe locations. Pigs responded increasingly negatively to ambiguous probes as pregnancy progressed and there were consistent inter-individual differences in baseline optimism.

To address these issues, we developed AMVOC (Analysis of Mouse VOcal Communication) as a free, open-source software to analyze and detect USVs in both online and offline modes. When compared to hand-annotated ground-truth USV data, AMVOC’s detection functionality (both offline and online) has high accuracy, and outperforms leading methods in noisy conditions, thus allowing for broader experimental use. AMVOC also includes the implementation of an unsupervised deep learning approach that facilitates discovery and analysis of USV data by clustering USVs using latent features extracted by a convolutional autoencoder and isimplemented in a graphical user interface (GUI), also enabling user’s evaluation. These results can be used to explore the vocal repertoire space of the analyzed vocalizations.

That is, the visual size of an object that “looks best” is linked to its typical physical size in the world. Why is this the case? One intuitive possibility is that these preferences are driven by semantic knowledge: For example, when we recognize a sofa, we access our knowledge about its real-world size, and this influences what size we prefer to view the sofa within a frame. However, might visual processing play a role in this phenomenon—that is, do visual features that are related to big and small objects look better at big and small visual sizes, respectively, even when observers do not have explicit access to semantic knowledge about the objects? To test this possibility, we used “texform” images, which are synthesized versions of recognizable objects, which critically retain local perceptual texture and coarse form information, but are no longer explicitly recognizable. To test for visual size preferences, we used a two-interval forced choice task, in which each texform was presented at the preferred visual size of its corresponding original image, and a visual size slightly bigger or smaller. Observers consistently selected the texform presented at the canonical visual size as the more aesthetically pleasing one. These results suggest that the preferred visual size of an object depends not only on explicit knowledge of its real-world size, but also can be evoked by mid-level visual features that systematically covary with an object’s real-world size.",16,2,3,34.0

However, birds and mammals display an appetite for information that they cannot use to functionally alter behaviour or its outcomes. We explore two putative motivational mechanisms for this paradoxical behaviour. The ‘information hypothesis’, proposes that reducing uncertainty is reinforcing per se, consistent with the concept of curiosity: a motivation to know, in the absence of instrumental benefits. In contrast, the ‘conditioned reinforcement hypothesis’ sees information-seeking as a consequence of asymmetries in secondarily acquired reinforcement: responding increments caused by post-choice stimuli announcing positive outcomes (S+) exceed decrements caused by stimuli signalling absence of reward (S−). We contrast these hypotheses experimentally. Rats chose between two equally profitable options delivering food probabilistically after a fixed delay. In the informative option (Info), the outcome (food/no food) was signalled immediately after choice, whereas in the non-informative option (NoInfo) outcomes were uncertain until the delay lapsed. Subjects preferred Info when (1) outcomes were signalled by salient auditory cues, (2) only the absence of reward was signalled, and (3) only reward was signalled, though acquisition was slower when rewards were not explicitly signalled. Our results show that a salient good news signal is not required as a conditioned reinforcer to generate paradoxical preferences. Terminal preferences support the information hypothesis but the slower acquisition of Info preference when S+ is not present is consistent with the conditioning account. We conclude that both uncertainty reduction and conditioned reinforcement influence choice.",18,5,10,42.0

During escape responses, fish bend their bodies into a C-shape and quickly turn away from the predator and accelerate. The escape trajectory is determined by the initial turn (Stage 1) and a contralateral bend (Stage 2). Previous studies have used a single threat or model predator as a stimulus. In nature, however, multiple predators may attack from different directions simultaneously or in close succession. It is unknown whether fish are able to change the course of their escape response when startled by multiple stimuli at various time intervals. Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) were startled with a left and right visual stimulus in close succession. By varying the timing of the second stimulus, we were able to determine when and how a second stimulus could affect the escape response direction. Four treatments were used: a single visual stimulus (control); or two stimuli coming from opposite sides separated by a 0 ms (simultaneous treatment); a 33 ms; or a 83 ms time interval. The 33 ms and 83 ms time intervals were chosen to occur shortly before and after a predicted 60 ms visual escape latency (i.e. during Stage 1). The 0 ms and 33 ms treatments influenced both the escape trajectory and the Stage 1 turning angle, compared to a single stimulation, whereas the 83 ms treatment had no effect on the escape response. We conclude that Pacific staghorn sculpin can modulate their escape response only between stimulation and the onset of the response, but that escape responses are ballistic after the body motion has started.SUMMARY STATEMENT Using double stimulation from opposite sides at different time intervals to simulate coordinated predatory attacks, Pacific staghorn sculpin escape away from the first stimulus, but were unable to turn away from the second stimulus while the escape response was in progress.",5,2,0,30.0

Measuring the movements of ants entails measuring the change in locations registered at time intervals. This process involves dilemma of setting the proper time window: a short time window is vulnerable to spatial errors in observation, while a long time window leads to underestimation of the travel distance. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel algorithm that successively interpolates two consecutive points of ant’s trajectory for a given time window by embracing the alternating tripod gait of ants. We demonstrate that this algorithm is more reliable compared to the conventional method of travel distance estimation based on the sum of the consecutive straight-line displacements (SLD). After obtaining speed estimates for a range of sampling time windows, we applied a fitting method that can estimate the actual speed without prior knowledge of spatial error distribution. We compared results from several methods of speed and curvature extracted from the empirical data of ant trajectories. We encourage empirical scientists to utilize the proposed methods rather than the conventional SLD method of speed estimation as this process is a more reliable and subjective selection of the sampling time window can be avoided.",6,3,5,30.0

Reinforcement learning offers a normative framework in which to test such hypotheses. Here, we show that a reinforcement learning agent that uses an episodic memory cache to find rewards in maze environments can forget a large percentage of older memories without any performance impairments, if they utilize mnemonic representations that contain structural information about space. Moreover, we show that some forgetting can actually provide a benefit in performance compared to agents with unbounded memories. Our analyses of the agents show that forgetting reduces the influence of outdated information and states which are not frequently visited on the policies produced by the episodic control system. These results support the hypothesis that some degree of forgetting can be beneficial for decision making, which can help to explain why the brain forgets more than is required by capacity limitations.",7,2,1,24.0

Using a cooperatively breeding fish, the daffodil cichlid (Neolamprologus pulcher), we conducted the first experimental test of the effects of chronic outgroup conflict on reproductive investment and output. ‘Intruded’ groups received long-term simulated territorial intrusions by neighbours that generated consistent group-defence behaviour; matched ‘Control’ groups (each the same size and with the same neighbours as an Intruded group) received no intrusions in the same period. Intruded groups had longer inter-clutch intervals and produced eggs with less protein than Control groups. Despite this lower egg investment, Intruded groups provided more parental care, achieving similar hatching success to Control groups. Ultimately, however, Intruded groups had fewer and smaller surviving offspring than Control groups at 1-month post-hatching.

Here, we propose that to achieve this, their brain uses spatial cells similarly to how we utilize encryption for data security. Some animals are able to cache hundreds of thousands of food items annually by each individual and later retrieve most of what they themselves stashed. Rather than memorizing their cache locations as previously suggested, we propose that they use a single cryptographic-like mechanism during both caching and retrieval. The model we developed is based on hippocampal spatial cells, which respond to an animal’s positional attention, such as when the animal enters a specific region (place-cells) or gazes at a particular location (spatial-view-cells). We know that the region that activates each spatial cell remains consistent across subsequent visits to the same area but not between areas. This remapping, combined with the uniqueness of cognitive maps, produces a persistent crypto-hash function for both food caching and retrieval. We also show that the model stores temporal information that helps animals in food caching order preference as previously observed. This behavior, which we refer to as crypto-taxis, might also explain consistent differences in decision-making when animals are faced with a large number of alternatives such as in foraging.",5,1,0,14.0

Most toothed whales, however, rely on echolocation for hunting and have converged on biosonar clicking rates reaching 500/s during prey pursuits. If echoes are processed on a click-by-click basis, as assumed, neural responses 100x faster than those in vision are required to keep pace with this information flow. Using high-resolution bio-logging of wild predator-prey interactions we show that toothed whales adjust clicking rates to track prey movement within 50-200ms of prey escape responses. Hypothesising that these stereotyped biosonar adjustments are elicited by sudden prey accelerations, we measured echo-kinetic responses from trained harbour porpoises to a moving target and found similar latencies. High biosonar sampling rates are, therefore, not supported by extreme speeds of neural processing and muscular responses. Instead, the neuro-kinetic response times in echolocation are similar to those of tracking reflexes in vision, suggesting a common neural underpinning.",9,2,5,26.0

Nevertheless, under the standard approaches, the experimental analysis of behavior is based on the single response paradigm and the temporal distribution of discrete responses. Thus, the continuous analysis of spatial behavioral dynamics has been a scarcely studied field. The technological advancements in computer vision have opened new methodological perspectives for the continuous sensing of spatial behavior. With the application of such advancements, recent studies suggest that there are multiple features embedded in the spatial dynamics of behavior, such as entropy, and that they are affected by programmed stimuli (e.g., schedules of reinforcement), at least, as much as features related to discrete responses. Despite the progress, the characterization of behavioral systems is still segmented, and integrated data analysis and representations between discrete responses and continuous spatial behavior are exiguous in the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. Machine Learning advancements, such as t-SNE, variable ranking, provide invaluable tools to crystallize an integrated approach for analyzing and representing multidimensional behavioral data. Under this rationale, the present work: 1) proposes a multidisciplinary approach for the integrative and multilevel analysis of behavioral systems, 2) provides sensitive behavioral measures based on spatial dynamics and helpful data representations to study behavioral systems, and 3) reveals behavioral aspects usually ignored under the standard approaches in the experimental analysis of behavior. To exemplify and evaluate our approach, the spatial dynamics embedded in phenomena relevant to behavioral science, namely water-seeking behavior, and motivational operations, are examined, showing aspects of behavioral systems hidden until now.",1566,84,233,28.0

Such species sometimes hybridize in nature, which raises the question how can they coexist. This also holds for the Tanganyika mouthbrooders Ophthalmotilapia ventralis and O. nasuta. Earlier studies found indications of asymmetrical hybridisation with females of O. ventralis accepting males of O. nasuta, but not the other way around. We hypothesised that this was due to differences in the capacity for species recognition. Given the higher propensity of O. ventralis females towards hybridization, we expect a reduced ability for species recognition in O. ventralis females, compared to O. nasuta females. We staged two experiments, one focusing on 22 female O. nasuta and one on 21 female O. ventralis. These fish were placed in one half of a tank and briefly exposed to a conspecific or a heterospecific male, a conspecific female, or nothing (control). Female response was evaluated by scoring six tracking parameters and by noting the occurrence of ten discrete behaviours before and during the first encounter. Females always responded to the presence of another fish by approaching it. Remarkably, for both O. nasuta and O. ventralis, we did not find a different response between encounters with conspecific males and females. However, in agreement with our hypothesis, O. nasuta females behaved differently towards conspecific or heterospecific males, whereas O. ventralis females did not. When presented with a heterospecific male, O. nasuta females performed a lower number of ‘ram’ behaviours. Additionally, they never displayed the ‘flee’ behaviour, a component of the species’ mating repertoire that was seen in all but one of the presentations with a conspecific male. Our findings show that differences in species recognition at first encounter predict to a large degree the outcome of the mating process, even in the absence of mating behaviour.",5,2,0,40.0

While most experimental data come from the study of morphological evolution, we know much less about the ultimate drivers of behavioral variation. Among the most striking examples of behavioral evolution are the long, complex burrows constructed by oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus ssp.). Yet how these mice use burrows in the wild, and whether burrow length may affect fitness, remains unknown. A major barrier to studying behavior in the wild has been the lack of technologies to continuously monitor – in this case, nocturnal and underground – behavior. Here, we designed and implemented a novel radio frequency identification (RFID) system to track patterns of burrow use in a natural population of beach mice. We combine RFID monitoring with burrow measurements, genetic data, and social network analysis to uncover how these monogamous mice use burrows under fully natural ecological and social conditions. We first found that long burrows provide a more stable thermal environment and have higher juvenile activity than short burrows, underscoring the likely importance of long burrows for rearing young. We also find that adult mice consistently use multiple burrows throughout their home range and tend to use the same burrows at the same time as their genetic relatives, suggesting that inclusive fitness benefits may accrue for individuals that construct and maintain multiple burrows.

In this study, we use a simple feed-forward neural network to investigate the consequences of having such a bottleneck and identify aspects of the network architecture that enable robust information transfer. We are able to explain some recently observed properties of descending neurons – that they exhibit a modular pattern of connectivity and that their excitation leads to consistent alterations in behavior that are often dependent upon the prior behavioral state (context-dependency). Our model predicts that in the presence of an information bottleneck, such a modular structure is needed to increase the efficiency of the network and to make it more robust to perturbations. However, it does so at the cost of an increase in context-dependency. Despite its simplicity, our model is able to provide intuition for the trade-offs faced by the nervous system in the presence of an information processing constraint and makes predictions for future experiments.",11,4,11,14.0

Females drank more Boost® than males but showed similar aversive behaviors after LiCl treatment. Males produced 55 kHz USVs (indicating positive valence) when anticipating Boost® and inhibited these calls after pairing with LiCl. Females produced 55 kHz USVs based on their estrous cycle but were more likely to make 22 kHz USVs than males (indicating negative valence) after pairing with LiCl. c-Fos responses were similar in males and females after Boost® or LiCl. Females engaged the gustatory cortex and ventral tegmental area more than males during the Boost® task and males engaged the amygdala more than females in both the reinforcing and devalued tasks. Network analysis of correlated c-Fos responses across brain regions identified two unique networks characterizing the Boost® and LiCl (CTA) tasks, in both of which the VTA played a central role.

Their complex nervous systems, intricate color- and texture-changing body patterns, and problem-solving abilities have attracted the attention of the biological research community, while the high growth rates and short life cycles of some species render them suitable for laboratory culture. Octopus chierchiae is a small octopus native to the central Pacific coast of North America whose predictable reproduction, short time to maturity, small adult size, and ability to lay multiple egg clutches (iteroparity) make this species ideally suited to laboratory culture. Here we describe novel methods for culture of O. chierchiae, with emphasis on enclosure designs, feeding regimes, and breeding management. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of multigenerational culture of O. chierchiae. Specifically, O. chierchiae bred in the laboratory grows from a 3.5-millimeter mantle length at hatching to an adult mantle length of approximately 20-30 millimeters in 250-300 days, with 14-15% survivorship to over 400 days of age in first and second generations. O. chierchiae sexually matures at around an estimated six months of age and, unlike most octopus species, can lay multiple clutches of eggs, approximately every 30-90 days. Eggs are large and hatchlings emerge as direct developing octopuses. Based on these results, we propose that O. chierchiae possesses both the practical and biological features needed for a model octopus that can be cultured repeatedly to address a wide range of fundamental biological questions.",10,4,5,29.0

Published prenatal hypoxia models generally require many days of modest hypoxia or are invasive, difficult to replicate surgery to ligate the uterine artery. Postnatal models of neonatal hypoxic brain injury are not able to study the effects of antenatal risk factors that contribute to outcomes of hypoxia to the developing brain. In addition, the most common postnatal hypoxia models induce significant cell death and large focal neuroanatomic injury through unilateral ischemia, which is not a common pattern of injury in children. Large animal models suggest that brief transient prenatal hypoxia alone is sufficient to lead to significant functional impairment to the developing brain. Thus, to further understand the mechanisms underlying hypoxic injury to the developing brain, it is vital to develop murine models that are simple to reproduce and phenocopy the lack of neuroanatomic injury but significant functional injury seen in children affected by mild intrauterine hypoxia. Here we characterized the effect of late gestation (embryonic day 17.5) transient prenatal hypoxia on long-term anatomical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Prenatal hypoxia induced hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha in the fetal brain. There was no difference in gestational age at birth, litter size at birth, survival, fetal brain cell death, or long-term changes in gray or white matter between offspring after normoxia and hypoxia. However, there were several long-term functional consequences from prenatal hypoxia, including sex-dichotomous changes. Both males and females have abnormalities in repetitive behaviors, hindlimb strength, and decreased seizure threshold. Males demonstrated increased anxiety. Females have deficit in social interaction. Hypoxia did not result in motor or visual learning deficits. This work demonstrates that transient late gestation prenatal hypoxia is a simple, clinically-relevant paradigm for studying putative environmental and genetic modulators of the long-term effects of transient hypoxia on the developing brain.",9,2,6,31.0

We develop a mathematical model of collective navigation that synthesises navigational cues and perception of other individuals. Crucially, this approach incorporates the uncertainty inherent to cue interpretation and perception in the decision making process, which can arise due to noisy environments. We demonstrate that collective navigation is more efficient than individual navigation, provided a threshold number of other individuals are perceptible. This benefit is even more pronounced in low navigation information environments. In navigation “blindspots”, where no information is available, navigation is enhanced through a relay that connects individuals in information-poor regions to individuals in information-rich regions. As an expository case study, we apply our framework to minke whale migration in the North East Atlantic Ocean, and quantify the decrease in navigation ability due to anthropogenic noise pollution.",556,27,128,37.0

Moreover, the use of antidepressants during this critical period presents a serious health concern for both the mother and the child, due to the consequences of treatment in terms of the reliability and safety for the proper neurodevelopment of the organism being not well known. Atypical antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, that targets both serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the central nervous system (CNS), represent a novel focus of research due to its unique pharmacological profile. The aim of this work was to study the effects of maternal depression and/or perinatal antidepressant mirtazapine treatment on the neurobehavioral development of the offspring. Pre-gestationally chronically stressed or non-stressed Wistar rat dams were treated with either mirtazapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle during pregnancy and lactation followed by analysis of offspring’s behavior at juvenile and adolescent age. We found mirtazapine induced alterations of nursing behavior. In offspring, pregestational stress (PS) had an anxiogenic effect on adolescent males and increased their active behavior in forced swim test. Interaction between pregestational stress and mirtazapine treatment variously induced anxiolytic changes of juvenile and adolescent females and impairment of spatial memory in adolescent females as well. Hippocampal density of synaptophysin, pre-synaptic protein marker, was decreased mainly by mirtazapine treatment.

However, best practices for the online portrayal of shelter and foster dogs remain unclear. Different online photo backgrounds appearing on adoption websites for shelter dogs may impact adoption speed by influencing viewer interest. Online clicking behaviour on pet profiles and human-directed sociability, broadly defined, has been previously linked to increased adoption likelihood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between photo backgrounds of shelter dogs and online clicking as well as perceived human-directed sociability. In a virtual experiment, 680 participants were asked to rank the sociability and friendliness of four different adoptable dogs on a scale from 0-10. The photo background of each dog was digitally altered and randomly assigned to four experimental background conditions: 1) outdoor, 2) home indoor, 3) in-kennel indoor, and 4) plain coloured. As a proxy for adoption interest, a link to the dog’s adoption profile was presented on each slide and the clicking behaviour of participants on this link was recorded. Mixed logistic regression and poisson models revealed that background did not affect participants’ link-clicking behaviour (chisq = 3.55, df = 3, p = .314) nor perceptions of sociability (statistic = 6.19, df = 3, p = .103). Across all backgrounds, only 4.74% of presented slides culminated in participant link-clicking. Sociability scores also did not predict link clicking. Assessment of participant-related factors and dog ID revealed that link-clicking and sociability scores of photographs were influenced by differences between dogs themselves and unaffected by participants’ awareness of study hypotheses.

Recent work, especially in the context of (spatial) attention, suggests that alpha activity reflects a mechanism of functional inhibition. However, it remains unclear how eye closure impacts anticipatory alpha modulation observed in attention paradigms, and how this affects subsequent behavioral performance. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 33 human participants performing a tactile discrimination task with their eyes open vs. closed. We replicated the hallmarks of previous somatosensory spatial attention studies: alpha lateralization across the somatosensory cortices as well as alpha increase over posterior regions. Furthermore, we found that eye closure leads to (i) reduced task performance, (ii) widespread increase in alpha power, and (iii) reduced anticipatory visual alpha modulation (iv) with no effect on somatosensory alpha lateralization. Regardless of whether participants had their eyes open or closed, increased posterior alpha power and somatosensory alpha lateralization improved their performance. Thus, we provide evidence that eye closure does not alter the impact of anticipatory alpha modulations on behavioral performance. We propose there is an optimal posterior alpha level for somatosensory task performance, which can be achieved through a combination of eye closure and top-down anticipatory attention.Significance Statement Alpha oscillations are dominant when awake participants have their eyes closed. Furthermore, alpha is known to modulate with anticipatory attention, and has been ascribed a role of active functional inhibition. Surprisingly, the link between anticipatory alpha and eye closure remains unclear. Here we collected MEG data while human participants performed a tactile discrimination task either with their eyes open or closed. Eye closure led to a widespread increase in alpha power, and affected anticipatory visual alpha modulation but not somatosensory alpha lateralization. Importantly, eye closure did not affect the correlation between alpha and task performance. Our findings provide novel insights into how eye closure impacts anticipatory alpha modulation, and how optimal alpha levels for task performance can be achieved differently.",4,2,0,35.0

We investigated how older adults use their arms to recover from a trip and the difference between fallers and non-fallers.Sixteen older participants walked along a walkway and were occasionally tripped using a custom tripping device. A biomechanical model used full-body marker and force-plate data to calculate the body rotation during the trip, and simulated the rotation without arms (Cut) and with transfer of the arms momentum to the body (Transfer &amp; Cut). We only analysed the first trip, distinguishing fallers (n=5) from non-fallers (n=11).Apart from an expected increase in forward body rotation at foot touchdown in fallers, we found no significant differences between fallers and non-fallers in the effects of arm movements on trip recovery. Like earlier studies in young participants, we found that arm movements had most favourable effect in the transversal plane: by delaying the transfer of angular momentum of the arms to the body, participants rotated the tripped leg more forward thereby allowing more room for a larger recovery step. Older adults that are prone to falling might improve their recovery from a trip by learning to [further] prolong ongoing arm movement.",5,2,2,15.0

Reliability of private information about environmental characteristics, such as the spatial distribution of prey, is thus likely to affect individual movement and social interactions during foraging. Our aim was to investigate how movement characteristics of foraging individuals changed as they acquired reliable private information about the spatial occurrence of prey in a foraging context.We allowed guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to develop the reliability of their private knowledge about prey spatial occurrence by repeatedly testing shoals in a foraging task under three experimental distributions of prey: 1) aggregated prey forming three patches located in fixed locations, 2) scattered distribution of prey with random locations, or 3) no prey (used as control). We then applied tracking methods to obtain individual time series of spatial coordinates from which we computed a suite of movement variables reflecting search effort, social proximity and locomotion characteristics during foraging, in order to examine changes occurring over repeated trials and to investigate which best explained foraging success.We show that foraging shoals became more efficient at finding and consuming food over the first three days by increasing their time spent active. Over time, individuals foraging on either scattered or aggregated prey travelled greater distances, showed an increasing distance to their closest neighbour and became slightly more stochastic in their acceleration profile, compared to control individuals.We found that behaviour changed as private information increased over time. Social proximity was the major predictor of foraging success in the absence of prior foraging information, while stochasticity in acceleration and search effort became the most important predictors of foraging success as information increased.In conclusion, we show that individual movement patterns changed as they acquire private information. Contrary to our predictions, the spatial distribution of prey did not affect any of the movement variables of interest. Our results emphasise the importance of information, both private and social, in shaping movement behaviour in animals.",4,2,0,33.0

Such coordination might prove difficult if opportunities to communicate are scarce, which might have led to the evolution of elaborate and noisy nest relief rituals in species facing a low risk of predation. However, whether such conspicuous rituals also evolved in species that avoid predation by relying on crypsis remains unclear. Here, we used a continuous monitoring system to describe nest relief behavior during incubation in an Arctic-breeding shorebird with passive nest defense, the semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla). We then explored whether nest relief behavior provides information about parental cooperation and predicts incubation effort. We found that incubating parents vocalized twice as much before the arrival of their partner than during other times of incubation. In 75% of nest reliefs, the incubating parent left the nest only after its partner had returned and initiated the nest relief. In these cases, exchanges were quick (25s, median) and shortened over the incubation period by 0.1 – 1.4s per day (95%CI), suggesting that parents became more synchronized. However, nest reliefs were not cryptic. In 90% of exchanges, at least one parent vocalized, and in 20% of nest reliefs the incubating parent left the nest only after its returning partner called instantaneously. In 30% of cases, the returning parent initiated the nest relief with a call; in 39% of these cases, the incubating partner replied. If the partner replied, the next off-nest bout was 1 – 4hr (95%CI) longer than when the partner did not reply, which corresponds to an 8 – 45% increase. Our results indicate that incubating semipalmated sandpipers, which rely on crypsis to avoid nest predation, have quick but acoustically conspicuous nest reliefs. Our results also suggest that vocalizations during nest reliefs may be important for the division of parental duties.LAY SUMMARYBiparental care requires coordination between parents. In species where both parents incubate and nests are visible, parents often perform complex nest relief rituals. Is this also the case in species where nests are cryptic?We video-recorded nest relief behavior at nests of cryptically incubating semipalmated sandpipers.Parents relieved each other quickly, but they vocalized frequently. In 20% of nest reliefs the incubating parent left only after its returning partner called instantaneously. In 30% of cases the returning parent initiated the nest relief with a call. If the partner replied, its next off-nest bout was 1 – 4hr longer than when the partner did not reply, which corresponds to an 8 – 45% increase.Our results suggest that vocalizations during nest relief may be important for the division of parental duties. Further work in sandpipers and other taxa is needed to elucidate the role of parental vocalization in coordinating and synchronizing parental duties.",3,2,0,20.0

Domesticated finches are likely able to allocate more resources to song development rather than allocating resources to mechanisms aimed at coping with predation, which are no longer needed under domesticated conditions. Here, we aimed to examine the effects of changes in selection pressure due to domestication on the behaviour of Bengalese finches and to contemplate the possible evolutionary mechanisms underlying these changes. To do so, we compared neophobic responses to novel-object conditions as an assessment of reactions to potential predators. We studied groups of Bengalese finches and white-rumped munias and found that Bengalese finches were more likely to eat the food provided to them under novel-object conditions. Bengalese finches had a shorter latency time to eat, and this latency time was less affected by the novel object in the case of Bengalese finches compared to white-rumped munias. Therefore, Bengalese finches have reduced neophobic responses due to domestication. The behavioural strategies of white-rumped munias appear to be more suitable for natural environments, which include unpredictable risks, whereas Bengalese finches have likely adapted their behaviour to the conditions of artificial selection.",916,54,140,26.0

While goal-directed behavior is driven by its consequences, habits are elicited by a situation rather than its consequences. Existing theories have proposed that actions are controlled by these two distinct systems. Although canonical theories based on such distinctions are starting to be challenged, there is no theoretical framework that implements goal-directed behavior and habits within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theoretical framework by hypothesizing that behavior is a network composed of several responses. With this framework, we have shown that the transition of goal-directed actions to habits is caused by a change in a single network structure. Furthermore, we confirmed that the proposed network model behaves in a manner consistent with the existing experimental results reported in animal behavioral studies. Our results revealed that habit could be formed under the control of a single system rather than two distinct systems. By capturing habit formation as a single network change, this framework can help study habit formation for experimental and theoretical research.Author summary To obtain the desired consequences, organisms need to respond based on the knowledge of the consequences obtained by the response and the change in the environment caused by it. Such a process is called goal-directed behavior, which is flexible, but requires high computational cost. Once the same response is repeatedly performed under the same environment, the response becomes automatic, and transforms into a habit. In the canonical views, such a change from goal-directed response to habit was explained by the associative structures between the corresponding systems, goal-directed, and habit systems. However, the dichotomy between goal-directed responses and habits has recently been challenged. Here, we show that, instead of assuming two explicitly distinguished systems as in the canonical views, behavior is regarded as a network consisting of multiple responses, and that changes in the structure of the network cause two behavioral features, goal-directed behavior and habit. The transition from goal-directed behavior to habit has been operationally defined by sensitivity to the reward obtained by the response. We replicate such an experimental paradigm in the simulation and show that the behavioral network model can reproduce the empirical results on habit formation obtained from animal experiments. Our results demonstrate that habit formation can be explained in terms of changes in the network structure of behavior without assuming explicitly distinct systems and thus, provide a new theoretical framework for habit formation.",371,2,55,38.0

Oliveira",2021.07.29.454277;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454277,"Sociality is often seen as a single phenotypic trait, but it relies on motivational and cognitive components implemented by specific causal mechanisms. Hence, these components may have evolved independently, or may have been linked by phenotypic correlations driven by a shared selective pressure for increased social competence. Furthermore, these components may be domain-specific or of general domain across social and non-social contexts. Here we have characterized the phenotypic architecture of sociality in zebrafish, which has been increasingly used as a model organism in social neuroscience. For this purpose, we have behaviorally phenotyped zebrafish from different wild type lines in four tests: social tendency, social and non-social recognition, and open-field test. Our results indicate that: (1) sociality has two main components that are independent from each other (social tendency and social recognition), hence not supporting the occurrence of a sociality syndrome; (2) both social traits are phenotypically linked to non-social traits (non-social exploration and non-social memory, respectively), forming two general behavioral modules, general inspection and general recognition, and suggesting that sociality traits have been co-opted from general-domain motivational and cognitive traits. Moreover, the study of the association between genetic polymorphisms (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and each behavioral module further supports this view, since several SNPs from a list of candidate “social” genes, are statistically associated with the general inspection (motivational), but not with a general recognition (cognitive), behavioral module. The SNPs associated with general inspection are widespread across different chromosomes and include neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and synaptic plasticity genes, suggesting that this behavioral module is regulated by multiple genes, each of them with small effects. Together, these results support the occurrence of general domain motivational and cognitive behavioral modules in zebrafish, which have been co-opted for the social domain.Author summary Social living has been considered one of the major transitions in evolution and it has been considered to act as a major selective force shaping the evolution of brain and behavior in animals. Sociality relies on two basic behavioral mechanisms: (1) the willingness to approach and be near others (aka social tendency); and (2) the ability to distinguish between others (aka social recognition) in order to adjust the behavior expressed during social interactions according to the identity of the interactant. There is an ongoing debate on to what extent these social abilities have specifically evolved in response to social living and are domain specific, or if they were selected as a broad response to cognitive demands and are of general domain. Here, we used zebrafish to test the domain-specific vs. general domain hypotheses and to assess the association of social tendency and social recognition with a set of candidate “social” genes (i.e. genes that have been linked to social behavior in other studies with different vertebrate species). We found that both social traits are not correlated to each other and are of general domain, and that only social tendency is associated with candidate “social” genes, suggesting that social tendency and social recognition are independent behavioral modules that rely on separate genetic architectures and that can evolve separately.",427,3,51,36.0

However, most of these data have been derived from experiments involving a single active response, and the context-specificity of relapse in situations involving choice between multiple actions and outcomes is less well-understood. We thus investigated how outcome-selective reinstatement involving choice between multiple actions was affected by altering the physical context in rats. In Experiment 1, rats were trained over 6 days to press a left lever for one food outcome (pellets or sucrose) and a right lever for the other outcome. Then, rats received an extinction session in either the same context (A) as lever press training, or in a different context (B). Rats were tested immediately (5 minutes) after extinction in Context A or B such that there were four groups in total: AAA, ABB, ABA, and AAB. Testing consisted of unsignalled presentations of pellet and sucrose outcomes, and selective reinstatement was intact if these presentations reinstated responding on the same lever that earned the outcome during training, e.g. pellet delivery should reinstate responding on the pellet lever. This result (Reinstated &gt; Nonreinstated) was observed for rats in group AAA and ABB, but not rats in groups ABA and AAB. Experiment 2 was conducted identically, except that rats received two extinction sessions over two days and tested one day later. This time, all groups demonstrated intact outcome-selective reinstatement regardless of context. Analysis of c-Fos expression in several brain regions revealed that only c-Fos expression in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) was related to intact reinstatement performance. Overall, these results suggest that outcome-selective reinstatement is partially context-dependent, and that intact reinstatement is related to neuronal activity in the pDMS.HighlightsOutcome-selective reinstatement is partially context-dependentOutcome-selective reinstatement is entirely context-independent after multiple extinction sessionsOutcome-selective reinstatement increases c-Fos expression in dorsomedial striatumc-Fos expression in orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus is unaffected by selective reinstatement.",248,2,38,25.0

As hormones such as estradiol and progesterone modulate the incidence of substance abuse disorders in women, it is important to consider the influence HCs have on the female brain and behavior. This experiment explores how female sex steroid hormonal states associated with the rat estrous cycle, and modulating those states with HCs, influences measures of drug preference and responsivity. First, rats underwent food-light Pavlovian conditioning to measure conditioned orienting, a known predictor of amphetamine (AMP) place preference. Then, rats were conditioned and tested for AMP place preference with either an HC-implant or during estrous cycle stages associated with different ovarian hormone levels (i.e., proestrus (P) or metestrus/diestrus (M/D) while recording ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as an index of hedonic responsivity. Because of dopamine’s (DA) role in modulation of AMP actions, DA cell activity and availability were examined using tyrosine hydroxylase and FOS immunohistochemistry after final AMP challenge. Conditioned orienting did not differ between cycling and HC-implanted. P rats emitted more USVs during conditioning, showed higher AMP place preference throughout testing, and had higher DA cell activity in the substantia nigra compared to M/D and HC-implanted rats. Sex steroid hormone serum concentration and uterine horn thickness predicted some but not all of these measures. This experiment suggests ovarian hormones affect drug preference and responsivity, while providing novel insight into how hormone-altering contraceptives may reduce these measures.",131,2,9,45.0

While the costs are relatively clear, scientists struggle to establish how larger brains translate into higher cognitive performance. Part of the challenge is that intuitively larger brains are needed to control larger bodies without any changes in cognitive performance. Therefore, body size needs to be controlled to establish the slope of cognitive equivalence between animals of different sizes. Potentially, intraspecific slopes provide the best available estimate of how an increase in body size translates into an increase in brain size without changes in cognitive performance. Here, we provide the first evaluation of this hypothesis for fishes. First, a dataset of 51 species that included only samples of ≥ ten wild-caught individuals yielded a mean brain-body slope of 0.46 (albeit with a large range of 0.26 to 0.79). This mean slope is similar to the encephalisation quotients for ectotherm higher taxa, i.e. teleost fishes, amphibians and reptiles (∼ 0.5). However, the slope is much higher than what has been found in endotherm vertebrate species (∼ 0.3). Second, we provide slope estimates for brain-body sizes and for cognition-body sizes in wild-caught cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus as a case study. Brain-body slopes from two datasets gave the values of 0.58 (MRI scans data) and 0.47 (dissection data). Furthermore, we have cognitive performance data from 69 individuals tested in four different cognitive tasks that estimated learning, numerical, and inhibitory control abilities. In all four tasks, the cognitive performance did not correlate significantly with body size. These results suggest that the brain-body slopes represent estimates of intraspecific cognitive equivalence for this species. While subject to further studies on various species, our results suggest that endo- and ectotherm brain organisations and resulting cognitive performances are fundamentally different.",356,46,132,31.0

Neophobia aids in navigating risk and impacts on adaptability and survival. There is variation within and between individuals and species, however, lack of large-scale, comparative studies critically limits investigation of the socio-ecological drivers of neophobia. In this study, we tested responses to novel objects and food (alongside familiar food) versus a baseline (familiar food alone) in 10 corvid species (241 subjects) across 10 labs worldwide. There were species differences in the latency to touch familiar food in the novel object and food conditions relative to the baseline. Three of seven socio-ecological factors influenced object neophobia: 1) use of urban habitat (vs not), 2) territorial pair vs family group sociality and 3) large vs small flock size (whereas range, caching, hunting live animals, and genus did not); while only flock size influenced food neophobia. We found that, overall, individuals were temporally and contextually repeatable (i.e. consistent) in their novelty responses in all conditions, indicating neophobia is a stable behavioural trait. With this study, we have established a network of corvid researchers, demonstrating potential for further collaboration to explore the evolution of cognition in corvids and other bird species.

The vocal culture of a songbird population changes as new song units (syllables) are introduced through immigration, copying errors, and innovation, while other syllables fall out of use. This leads to a diversification of the syllable pool across the species, much like the diversification and spatial patterns of human language. Vocal cultures have been well studied in male songbirds but have been largely overlooked in females. In particular, few studies compare spatial variation of male and female song cultures. Here we undertake one of the first comparisons of male and female song culture in birds, analysing song data from a metapopulation of New Zealand bellbirds Anthornis melanura, spanning an archipelago of six islands. Having classified 20,700 syllables, we compare population syllable repertoire sizes and overlap between sites and sexes. We show that males and females—both with complex songs—have distinct song cultures, sharing only 6–26% of syllable types within each site. Furthermore, male and female syllable types can be statistically discriminated based on acoustic properties. Despite diverse syllable repertoires within sites, few syllable types were shared between sites (both sexes had highly distinct site-specific dialects). For the few types shared between sites, sharing decreased with distance only for males. Overall, there was no significant difference between sexes in degree of site–site repertoire overlap. These results suggest different cultural processes at play for the two sexes, underlining the inadequacy of male-centric song research and calling for comparisons of male and female song cultures in many more species.",1391,46,211,32.0

Gathering with conspecifics and using social information about their activities may reveal the location of suitable feeding and breeding sites. This could compensate for the absence of individual information about new habitats and constitute an advantage for new settlers. If a tendency to gather in response to social stimuli is transmitted from one generation to the next, and if the benefit of gathering is lower in long time established populations, there should be behavioural differences in receptivity to social cues in populations with different colonizing histories. We hypothesized that individuals of a social species like the European starling from relatively recently-established populations would be more responsive to social cues than individuals belonging to long-established populations. We conducted playback experiments using a starling chorus to test its acoustic attractiveness to populations of starlings with different colonizing histories. We compared the reaction of individuals from two populations in rural Brittany, western France, established for a long time, with three more recently settled ones: two populations from a propagation front in southern Italy and one urban population from Rennes city in Brittany.

Particularly, research have focused on the personality of invaders and on their way of coping with novelty in new habitats. Traits of neophobia may limit individuals in their exploration of novel objects or the consumption of novel foods, they may stop the access to valuable ressources. Actually, in novel environments like cities, food can be unreachable in throwaway dishes with lids or hidden in the garbage or even close to frightening objects. Animals may either left the place and waste these resources, or they can express low neophobia from the beginning and manipulate the objects to reach food. They may also habituate progressively to the context and use the ressources.Here we analyzed the behavioural responses of individuals from three populations of European starling Sturnus vulgaris: a population anciently settled in a rural region, a population that has recently colonized a urban area and a population of wintering migrant birds.We used a series of tests in order to explore if individuals would habituate to a novel object and if they could remember it eight months later. We explored if individuals would be less neophobic when confronted to two novel objects successively and we tested them in a learning task involving a novel object and an attractive food. Our results show that Sturnus vulgaris habituates rapidly to novel objects and that categorization facilitates neophobia lost when confronted to two different novel objects.

In birds, both invaders and migrants encounter novel situations, therefore one could expect that both groups might react similarly to novelty.Here we analyzed the behavioral responses of individuals from three populations of European starling Sturnus vulgaris: a population settled for centuries in a rural region, a population that recently colonized an urban area, and a population of winter migrant birds. We conducted a social isolation test, a novel environment test, a novel food test and a novel object test to explore their reactions towards novelty. We identified and characterized different behavioral profiles for each test.The group of migratory adults appeared to be less anxious in social isolation than the group of urban young. Urban and migrant groups entered the novel environment sooner than rural birds. Shy, bold and intermediate individuals were observed in all three groups when presented with novel food. Finally, the proportion of shy individuals which did not touch the novel object was higher than the proportion of bold individuals in the rural group. Our study emphasizes that neophilia or boldness present in migrant and invasive populations may facilitate the occupation of novel habitats. Our analysis also suggests that mixed reactions of neophobia ensure behavioral flexibility in a gregarious invasive species.Significant statement In this paper, we show that an invasive species like European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, presents an important flexibility in neophobia and in reaction towards social isolation. These variations depend on the settlement history of populationseven when the birds had been wild-caught as nestlings and hand-raised in standard conditions. This is significant because it highlights possible scenarios of colonization processes.We believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology because it places individuals’ behavior in the core mechanisms of an ecological phenomenom as biological invasions. Our manuscript enlarges the paradigms related to the ways of coping with novelty in animals.This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.",450,14,41,51.0

The ability of an organism to determine a conspecific’s likely intentions from their gaze direction may confer an advantage to individuals in a social group. This advantage could be cooperative and/or competitive. Humans are unusual in possessing depigmented sclerae whereas most other extant primates, including the closely related chimpanzee, possess dark scleral pigment. The origins of divergent scleral morphologies are currently unclear, though human white sclerae are often assumed to underlie our hyper-cooperative behaviors. Here, we use phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses with previously generated species-level scores of proactive prosociality, social tolerance (both n=15 primate species), and conspecific lethal aggression (n=108 primate species) to provide the first quantitative, comparative test of three complementary hypotheses. The cooperative eye [M. Tomasello, B. Hare, H. Lehmann, J. Call, J. Hum. Evol. 52, 314–320 (2007)] and self-domestication [B. Hare, Annu. Rev. Psychol. 68, 155-186 (2017)] explanations predict white sclerae to be associated with cooperative, rather than competitive, environments. The gaze camouflage hypothesis [H. Kobayashi, S. Kohshima, J. Hum. Evol. 40, 419-435 (2001)] predicts that dark scleral pigment functions as gaze direction camouflage in competitive social environments. We show that white sclerae in primates are associated with increased cooperative behaviors whereas dark sclerae are associated with reduced cooperative behaviors and increased intra-specific lethal aggression. Our results lend support to all three hypotheses of scleral evolution, suggesting that primate scleral morphologies evolve in relation to variation in social environment.",1178,24,170,16.0

A prominent hypothesis, mostly based on preclinical studies, is that individual differences in the gut microbiome composition and drug-induced dysbiosis may be associated with vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including substance use disorder. However, most studies used small sample size, ignored individual differences, or used animal models with limited relevance to addiction. Here, we test the hypothesis that pre-existing microbiome composition and drug-induced changes in microbiome composition can predict addiction-like behaviors using an advanced animal model of extended access to cocaine self-administration in a large cohort of heterogenous stock (HS) rats. Adult male and female HS rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine under short (2h/day) and long access (6h/day) for ~7 weeks under various schedule of reinforcement to identify individuals that are resistant or vulnerable to addiction-like behaviors and fecal samples were collected before the first session and after the last session to assess differences in the microbiome composition. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) identified sex-dependent and sex-independent differences at the phylum, order, and species level that are differentially abundant in resistant vs. vulnerable individuals, including high level of actinobacteria both before the first exposure to cocaine and after 7 weeks of cocaine self-administration in resistant animals. Predictions of functional gene content using PICRUSt revealed differential regulation of short-chain fatty acid processing in the vulnerable group after self-administration. These results identify microbiome constituents as well as metabolic pathways that are associated with resistance or vulnerability to addiction-like behaviors in rats. Identification of microbes and tangential metabolic pathways involved in cocaine resilience/vulnerability may represent an innovative strategy for the development of novel biomarkers and medication for the treatment of cocaine use disorder.",645,16,69,24.0

Birdsongs serve as a representative model for studying the context dependency in sequential signals produced by non-human animals, while previous reports were upper-bounded by methodological limitations. Here, we newly estimated the context dependency in birdsongs in a more scalable way using a modern neural-network-based language model whose accessible context length is sufficiently long. The detected context dependency was beyond the order of traditional Markovian models of birdsong, but was consistent with previous experimental investigations. We also studied the relation between the assumed/auto-detected vocabulary size of birdsong (i.e., fine-vs. coarse-grained syllable classifications) and the context dependency.

Results from this work provide insight into the dolphins’ movement patterns, kinematic diversity, and how changes in the environment affect their dynamics. Fixed overhead cameras were used to collect ∼100 hours of observations, recorded over multiple days including time both during and outside of formal training sessions. Animal locations were estimated using convolutional neural network (CNN) object detectors and Kalman filter post-processing. The resulting animal tracks were used to quantify habitat use and animal dynamics. Additionally, Kolmogorov-Smirnov analyses of the swimming kinematics were used for high-level behavioral mode classification. The detectors achieved a minimum Average Precision of 0.76. Performing detections and post-processing yielded 1.24×107 estimated dolphin locations. Animal kinematic diversity was found to be lowest in the morning and peaked immediately before noon. Regions of the habitat displaying the highest activity levels correlated to locations associated with animal care specialists, conspecifics, or enrichment.

This study was designed to evaluate effects of using a plethora of pen enrichments (barrier perches, angular ramps, horizontal platforms, large distance between feed and water and providing live Black Soldier fly larvae in a dustbathing area) on tibia characteristics, locomotion, leg health and home pen behaviour of fast and slower-growing broiler chickens. The experiment was set up as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with a total of 840 male broiler chickens in a complete randomized design (7 replicates per treatment and 30 chickens per replicate) with the following treatments: 1) pen enrichment (enriched pen or non-enriched pen); 2) broiler strain (fast-growing Ross 308 or slower-growing Hubbard JA 757). Home pen behaviour and use of enrichment were observed. At approximately 1400 and 2200 gram body weight, two chickens per pen were randomly selected and slaughtered, to investigate tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics and leg health. Pen enrichment positively affected tibia biophysical characteristics, e.g., osseous volume (Δ=1.8 cm3, P=0.003), total volume (Δ=1.4 cm3, P=0.03) and volume fraction (Δ=0.02 %, P=0.002), in both fast and slower-growing chickens, suggesting that pen enrichment particularly affects ossification and mineralization mechanisms. Accordingly, locomotion and active behaviours were positively influenced by pen enrichment. However, pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight gain in both strains, which might be due to higher activity or lower feed intake as a result of difficulties of crossing the barrier perches. Regarding the strain, slower-growing chickens showed consistently more advanced tibia characteristics and more active behaviour than fast-growing chickens. It can be concluded that pen enrichment may lead to more activity and better bone development in both fast and slower-growing chickens.",547,18,46,43.0

In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that fish prefer to use the entire water column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, fish show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to move away from the sides of the cage. Even when strong currents and waves decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage. This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high biomass caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that keeping the cone portion of the cage available in strong currents would be beneficial to salmon welfare.",483,18,36,24.0

In some songbirds, only males produce songs while females do not. Female birds are sensitive to inter- and intra-species song variation. Some aspects of female song preference depend on developmental experiences. For example, in Bengalese finches and zebra finches, adult females prefer the song to which they were exposed early in life, such as the father’s song. However, it is unclear whether such song preference in females is sexually motivated. The purpose of our study is to test if female Bengalese finches recognize their father’s song as sexually attractive. We measured copulation solicitation displays during playbacks of the father’s song vs. unfamiliar conspecific songs and found that across individuals, the father’s song elicited more displays than other songs. In addition, we analyzed if a bird’s response to a given song could be predicted by the level of similarity of that song to the father’s song. The results suggest that preference for the father’s song in this species is actually relevant to mate choice. Although more precise control is necessary in future studies to elucidate the process of preference development, our results imply the significance of early-life experience in shaping female song preference.",494,28,50,27.0

Yet, the effects of fog have only been rarely studied, although they could disrupt orientation and hamper the accomplishment of the journey. Soaring migrants modulate their flight speed and direction in relation to the wind vector to optimize the cost of transport. Fog could limit the visibility of migrating birds such that they might not be able to detect landmarks that guide them during their journey. Consequently, landmark-based orientation, as well as adjustments of flight speed and direction in relation to wind conditions, could be jeopardized when flying in fog. Using a radar system that operated in a migration bottleneck (Strait of Messina, Italy), we studied the behaviour of soaring birds under variable wind and fog conditions over two consecutive springs (2016 and 2017), discovering that migrating birds exhibited a wider scatter of flight directions and responded differently to wind conditions under fog conditions. Birds flying through fog deviated more from the mean migration direction and increased their speed with increasing crosswinds. In addition, airspeed and groundspeed increased in the direction of the crosswind, causing a lateral drift of the individuals. Furthermore, the response to tailwind was opposite to that predicted by optimal migration theory. Our findings represent the first quantitative empirical evidence of flight behaviour changes when birds migrate through fog and explain why low visibility conditions could risk their migration journey.",531,21,38,9.0

Estrous cycle stage (i.e., proestrus (P, high hormone) or metestrus/diestrus (M/D, low hormone)) was considered during two important learning and behavioral expression windows: at extinction training and during LTM/renewal testing. First, rats in P during context-dependent extinction training but in some other stage of the estrous cycle during long-term memory and renewal testing (Different) were shown to exhibit more renewal of conditioned foodcup (but not conditioned orienting) behavior compared to rats in other estrous cycle groups. Next, cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) was used to examine immediate early gene activity of Arc mRNA in neuronal populations after distinct context-stimulus exposures (i.e., extinction and acquisition test contexts). Arc mRNA expression patterns were examined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, hippocampus (HPC), and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. P-different rats showed differential neuronal population activity in the infralimbic cortex of the PFC, the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, and both CA1 and CA3 regions of the dorsal HPC.

Chemical attractants provide one means of directing individuals into an aggregate, but whether these structures emerge can depend on various factors, such as there being a sufficiently large population or the response to the attractant being sufficiently sensitive. In an aquatic environment, fluid flow may heavily impact on population distribution and many aquatic organisms adopt a rheotaxis response when exposed to a current, orienting and swimming according to the flow field. Consequently, flow-induced transport could be substantially different for the population members and any aggregating signal they secrete. With the aim of investigating how flows and rheotaxis responses impact on an aquatic population’s ability to form and maintain an aggregated profile, we develop and analyse a mathematical model that incorporates these factors. Through a systematic analysis into the effect of introducing rheotactic behaviour under various forms of environmental flow, we demonstrate that each of flow and rheotaxis can act beneficially or detrimentally on the ability to form and maintain a cluster. Synthesising these findings, we test a hypothesis that density-dependent rheotaxis may be optimal for group formation and maintenance, in which individuals increase their rheotactic effort as they approach an aggregated state.",521,23,60,14.0

Epidemiological studies suggest that poor nutrition is a significant contributor to this public health crisis, specifically through exposure to high level of dietary sugar, including fructose, during critical periods of development. Previous studies have shown that elevated fructose exposure during adolescence disrupts mental health. Further, it seems that infants display the highest level of exposure to fructose based on nutritional surveys. Despite these data, it is currently unknown how fructose exposure, specifically during infancy, may impact adolescent mental health.Methods We developed an experimental protocol in rats to investigate the effects of fructose exposure during infancy on behavioral, cognitive and metabolic endpoints in adolescence. Specifically, rat pups were exposed to fructose from birth until weaning through maternal diet. Metabolic assays, quantitative PCR and behavioral protocols such as open field, elevated O maze and a Go/ No-Go operant task, were used to determine whether high fructose exposure during infancy may set the stage for behavioral and metabolic dysfunction in adolescence.Results We found that exposing rats to high fructose from birth to weaning resulted in higher circulating glucose, insulin and leptin levels in adolescence. High fructose during infancy also increased bodyweight, disrupted metabolic homeostasis in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) as indicated by decreased activity of the cellular energy sensor AMPK, and impaired attention and impulsivity in a male-specific manner. This impaired attention observed in adolescent male rats following neonatal fructose exposure was partially rescued by viral-mediated, in vivo expression of a constitutively active form of AMPK in principal neurons of the BLA.Conclusion Our results suggest that exposure to high level of fructose during infancy may impact adolescent mental health in a male-specific manner and that manipulation of AMPK activity may mitigate this impact.",554,45,71,22.0

For instance, a talented musician can conceivably transfer her knowledge of flute fingerings and guitar songs to play guitar music on a piccolo for the first time. Yet there are also instances where it can be helpful to learn and transfer not just individual task components, but entire structures or substructures, particularly whenever these recur in natural tasks (e.g., in bluegrass music one might transfer the joint structure of finger movements and musical scales from one stringed instrument to another). Prior theoretical work has explored how agents can learn and generalize task components or entire latent structures, but a satisfactory account for how a single agent can simultaneously satisfy the two competing demands is still lacking. Here, we propose a hierarchical model-based agent that learns and transfers individual task components as well as entire structures by inferring both through a non-parametric Bayesian model of the task. It maintains a factorised representation of task components through a hierarchical Dirichlet process, but it also represents different possible covariances between these components through a standard Dirichlet process. We validate our approach on a variety of navigation tasks covering a wide range of statistical correlations between task components and show that this hierarchical framework can also be applied to improve generalisation and transfer in hierarchical tasks with goal/subgoal structures.",769,29,139,28.0

We tested the hypothesis that the reinstatement of responding to an appetitive CS is driven by an excitatory association formed between the US and the context that the US was ingested in during US re-exposure. Male, Long-Evans rats were acclimated to drinking alcohol (15%, v/v) in the home-cage, then trained to associate an auditory CS with an alcohol-US that was delivered into a fluid port for oral intake. During subsequent extinction sessions, the CS was presented as before, but without alcohol. After extinction, rats were re-exposed to alcohol as in training, but without the CS (alcohol re-exposure). 24 h later at test, the CS was presented as in training, but without alcohol. First, we tested the effect of extinguishing the context-alcohol association, formed during alcohol re-exposure, on reinstatement. Conducting four context extinction sessions across four days (spaced extinction) after the alcohol re-exposure session did not impact reinstatement. However, four context extinction sessions conducted across two days (massed extinction) prevented reinstatement. Next, we conducted alcohol re-exposure in a context that either differed from, or was the same as, the test context. One alcohol re-exposure session in a different context did not affect reinstatement, however, three alcohol re-exposure sessions in a different context significantly reduced reinstatement during the first CS trial.

Here we presented pastry with flavour profiles typical of human foods (oily, salty, sweet) to small and medium ground finches to test if latent taste preferences might drive selection of human foods. If human-food flavours were consumed more than a neutral or bitter control at sites with human foods, then we predicted tastes were acquired after experience with human foods; however, if no site-differences were found then this would indicate latent taste preferences. Contrary to both predictions, we found no evidence that human-food flavours were preferred compared to control flavours. Instead, medium ground finches consumed the bitter control pastry most and wiped their beaks more frequently after feeding on oily and sweet pastry (post-ingestion beak wiping can indicate aversions). Small ground finches showed no differences in consumption but wiped their beaks most after feeding on sweet pastry. Our results suggest that unlike many species, medium and small ground finches do not find bitter-tasting food aversive.

To understand how these birds afford their flights over the open sea, we investigated the role of atmospheric conditions, specifically wind and uplift, in subsidizing over-water flight at the global scale. We first established that ΔT, the temperature difference between sea surface and air, is a meaningful proxy for uplift over water. Using this proxy, we showed that the spatio-temporal patterns of sea-crossing in terrestrial migratory birds is associated with favorable uplift conditions. We then analyzed route selection over the open sea for five facultative soaring species, representing all major migratory flyways. The birds maximized wind support when selecting their sea-crossing routes and selected higher uplift when suitable wind support was available.

The stability of animal social organization reflects how individuals construct and maintain resilient patterns of interactions across changes in group size and membership. In this study we describe patterns of social interactions in captive flocks of Gouldian Finches (Erythrura gouldiae) that were exposed to changing social conditions. A flock of adult Gouldian Finches was exposed to two changing conditions, an introduction condition where juveniles were introduced to the flock, and a fission-fusion condition where the flock was split into two smaller flocks and a new group of juveniles introduced to each. We show that the social organization of captive Gouldian finch flocks is characterized by stable homophilic communities of adult females and juveniles. Females showed higher rates of approaches to other adult females, while juveniles maintined higher rates of approaches towards other juveniles. These findings highlight how the stable interactive decisions made by individuals contribute to higher-order patterns of organization in bird flocks. Furthermore, this study is one of the few to demonstrate self-assortment of juveniles in passerine flocks and suggests that peer and sibling interactions are an unexplored area in avian social development.",697,29,48,21.0

A recent study conducted in our laboratory suggest that the features embedded in the spatial dynamics of behavior are affected by stimulus-schedules, at least, as much as features embedded in discrete responses. In that study we compared the spatial behavioral dynamics under two time-based schedules (fixed vs variable time) of water delivery, and two different locations of water delivery (delivery in central zone vs. perimetral zone) on a Modified Open Field System (MOFS). The present work replicates those findings taking in consideration previously uncontrolled variables. In Experiment 1, three subjects were exposed to a Fixed Time 30s water-delivery schedule. In the first phase the water dispenser was located at the perimetral zone. In the second condition, the water dispenser was located at the central zone. Each location was presented for 20 sessions. In Experiment 2, conditions were the same, but a Variable Time schedule was used. Measures of entropy were used to describe the spatial behavioral dynamics. We found higher levels of entropy under central location of water delivery than in the perimetral location; and higher entropy under Fixed than Variable Time Schedule, confirming previous findings but under different sequences of dispenser locations. In general, a well-differentiated dynamic between experimental conditions was observed in terms of direction (distance to the dispenser) and variation (entropy) of spatial behavior.

Linked to a variety of maladaptive behaviours in humans, inhibitory control is expected to influence behavioural plasticity in animals in the context of foraging, social interaction, or responses to sudden changes in the environment. One widely used cognitive assay, the ‘detour task’, putatively tests inhibitory control. In this task, subjects must avoid impulsively touching transparent barriers positioned in front of food, and instead access the food by an alternative but known route. Recently it has been suggested that the detour task is unreliable and measures factors unrelated to inhibitory control, including motivation, previous experience and persistence. Consequently, there is growing uncertainty as to whether this task leads to erroneous interpretations about animal cognition and its links with socio-ecological traits. To address these outstanding concerns, we designed a variant of the detour task for wild great tits (Parus major) and deployed it at the nesting site of the same individuals across two spring seasons. This approach eliminated the use of food rewards, limited social confounds, and maximised motivation. We compared task performance in the wild with their performance in captivity when tested using the classical cylinder detour task during the non-breeding season. Task performance was temporally and contextually repeatable, and none of the confounds had any significant effect on performance, nor did they drive any of the observed repeatable differences among individuals. These results support the hypothesis that our assays captured intrinsic differences in inhibitory control. Instead of ‘throwing the detour task out with the bathwater’, we suggest confounds are likely system and experimental-design specific, and that assays for this potentially fundamental but largely overlooked source of behavioural plasticity in animal populations, should be validated and refined for each study system.",849,37,88,29.0

Naturally mated queens of the following five subspecies from different parts of Europe were transferred to Southern Germany: A. m. iberiensis from Portugal, A. m. mellifera from Belgium, A. m. macedonica from Greece, A.m. ligustica from Italy and A. m. ruttneri from Malta. We also included the local subspecies A.m. carnica in our study. New colonies were built up in a common apiary where the respective queens were introduced. Worker offspring from the different subspecies was compared in classical olfactory learning performance using the proboscis extension response. Prior to conditioning we measured individual sucrose responsiveness to investigate whether possible differences in learning performances were due to a differential responsiveness to the sugar water reward. Most subspecies did not differ in their appetitive learning performance. However, foragers of the Iberian honeybee, A. m. iberiensis, performed significantly more poorly, despite having a similar sucrose responsiveness.

Despite of its complexity, we are focusing on the quorum sensing mechanism, which is also observed in bacteria model. In bacterial model, multiple biochemical networks co-exist within each cell, including binding of autoinducer and cognate receptors, and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. In ant hunting, we also have ant commitment to the nest, mimicking binding between autoinducer and cognate receptors. We also have assessment ant specific to one nest and information exchange between two assessment ants corresponding to different nests, which is similar process to the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle in bacteria quorum sensing network. Due to the similarity between the two models, we borrow the idea from bacteria quorum sensing to clarify the definition of quorum threshold through biological plausible mechanism related to limited resource model.

Prolactin underlies parental behaviors and related physiological changes across many vertebrates, including birds and mammals. While circulating prolactin levels often fluctuate across breeding, less is known about how relevant target tissues vary in their prolactin responsiveness via prolactin receptor (PRLR) expression. Recent studies have also investigated prolactin (PRL) gene expression outside of the pituitary (i.e., extra-pituitary PRL), but how PRL gene expression varies during parental care in non-pituitary tissue (e.g., hypothalamus, gonads) remains largely unknown. Further, it is unclear if and how tissue-specific PRL and PRLR vary between the sexes during biparental care. To address this, we measured PRL and PRLR gene expression in tissues relevant to parental care, the endocrine reproductive hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal (HPG) axis and the crop (a tissue with a similar function as the mammalian mammary gland), across various reproductive stages in both sexes of a biparental bird, the rock dove (Columba livia). We also assessed how these genes responded to changes in offspring presence by adding chicks mid-incubation, simulating an early hatch when prolactin levels were still moderately low. We found that pituitary PRL expression mirrored changes in plasma prolactin levels, and detected extra-pituitary PRL in the hypothalamus, gonads and crop. Hypothalamic and gonadal PRLR expression also changed as birds began incubation. Crop PRLR expression correlated with plasma prolactin, peaking when chicks hatched. Hypothalamic and gonadal PRL and PRLR gene expression differed significantly in response to offspring cues, even when plasma prolactin levels did not differ. We also found sex differences in PRL and PRLR that suggest gene expression may allow males to compensate for lower levels in prolactin by upregulating PRLR in all tissues. Overall, this study advances our understanding of how tissue-specific changes in responsiveness to parental hormones may differ across key reproductive transitions, in response to offspring cues, and between the sexes.",850,32,76,42.0

SSRIs cross the placenta and affect serotonergic neurotransmission in the fetus, but the neurobehavioral consequences for the offspring remain largely unclear. Recent rodent research has linked perinatal SSRI exposure to alterations in both social and non-social aspects of behavior. However, this research has mainly focused on behavior within simplified environments. The current study investigates the effects of perinatal SSRI exposure on social and non-social investigation behaviors of adult rat offspring upon introduction to a novel seminatural environment with unknown conspecifics. During the perinatal period (gestational day 1 until postnatal day 21), rat dams received daily treatment with either an SSRI (fluoxetine, 10 mg/kg) or vehicle. Adult male and female offspring were observed within the first hour after introduction to a seminatural environment. The results showed that perinatal fluoxetine exposure altered aspects of non-social investigation behaviors, while not altering social investigation behaviors. More specifically both fluoxetine exposed males and females spent more total time on locomotor activity than controls. Furthermore, fluoxetine exposed females spent less time exploring objects and specific elements in the environment. The data suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs leads to a quicker, less detailed investigation strategy in novel environments, and that the alteration is mostly pronounced in females.",533,63,119,33.0

The prospect of gains might enhance flexible learning through prioritized processing of reward-predicting stimuli but is unclear how far this learning benefit extends when task demands increase. Similarly, experiencing losses might facilitate learning when they trigger attentional re-orienting away from loss-inducing stimuli, but losses may also impair learning by reducing the precise encoding of loss-inducing stimuli. To clarify these divergent views, we tested how varying magnitudes of gains and losses affect the flexible learning of object values in environments that varied attentional load by increasing the number of interfering object features during learning. With this task design we found that larger prospective gains improved learning efficacy and learning speed, but only when attentional load was low. In contrast, expecting losses generally impaired learning efficacy and this impairment was larger at higher attentional load. These findings functionally dissociate the contributions of prospective gains and losses on flexible learning, suggesting they operate via separate control mechanisms. One process is triggered by experiencing loss and seems to disrupt the encoding of specific loss-inducing features which leads to less efficient exploration during learning. The second process is triggered by experiencing gains which enhances learning through a more efficient prioritizing of reward-predicting stimulus features as long as the interference of distracting information is limited. These results demonstrate strengths and limitations of motivational regulation of learning efficacy in multidimensional environments having variable attentional loads.Significance statement Increasing the prospective gains is assumed to enhance flexible learning, but there is no consensus on whether imposing losses enhances or impairs flexible learning. We show that anticipating loss of already attained assets generally reduced learning changes in the relevance of visual objects and that this learning impediment is more pronounced when learning demands higher attentional control of interference from distracting object features. Moreover, we show that increasing the prospective gains indeed facilitates learning, but only when the learning problem has intermediate or low attentional demands. These findings document that the beneficial effects of gains hit a limit when task demands increase, and that prospective losses reduce cognitive flexibility already at low task demands which is exacerbated when task demands increase. These findings provide novel insight into the strengths and limitations of gains and of losses to support flexible learning in multidimensional environments imposing variable attentional loads.",1176,126,351,43.0

This spread depends upon the transmission of social information, or social learning, between individuals. However, not all information spreads. To better understand how constraints at the individual-, dyad- and group-level might influence the formation of culture, we experimentally introduced four innovations (novel behaviours) across three troops of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). At the individual-level, different phenotypic traits constrained individuals’ use of social information about the innovations. At the dyad-level, we found evidence for social reinforcement and directed social learning affecting who learnt and from whom. Group-level characteristics also limited the diffusion of information, which spread more slowly through social networks that showed less mixing across age classes. Nevertheless, despite these multi-level limitations, the four innovations quickly spread through all the social groups in which they were tested, suggesting that the formation of animal cultures can be surprisingly resilient to constraints on information transmission.",750,28,78,34.0

Individual ants show a transition from individual exploratory excavation at random locations to spatially localized collective exploitative excavation and escape from the corral. A minimal continuum theory that coarse-grains over individual actions and considers their integrated influence on the environment leads to the emergence of an effective phase space of behaviors in terms of excavation strength and cooperation intensity. To test the theory over the range of predicted behaviors, we used custom-built robots (RAnts) that respond to stimuli and show the emergence (and failure) of cooperative excavation and escape.

One fundamental, unresolved question is whether information processed prior to a decision being made (‘pre-decisional information’) has any influence on the likelihood and speed with which that decision is reversed. We investigated this using a luminance discrimination task in which participants indicated which of two flickering greyscale squares was brightest. Following an initial decision, the stimuli briefly remained on screen, and participants could change their response. Using psychophysical reverse correlation, we examined how moment-to-moment fluctuations in stimulus luminance affected participants’ decisions. This revealed that the strength of even the very earliest (pre-decisional) evidence was associated with the likelihood and speed of later changes of mind. To account for this effect, we propose an extended diffusion model in which an initial ‘snapshot’ of sensory information biases ongoing evidence accumulation.Author Summary To avoid harm in dynamic environments we need to be able to rapidly change our minds about our decisions. For example, imagine being unable to overrule a decision to run across a street when you realise a speeding car is approaching. In this study, we examine the information processing dynamics which underlie perceptual decisions and changes of mind. By reverse correlating participants decisions with the moment-to-moment sensory evidence they received, we show that the very earliest information, processed prior to an initial decision being made, has a lasting influence over the speed and likelihood of subsequent changes of mind. To account for this, we develop a model of perceptual decisions in which initial sensory evidence exerts a lasting bias over later evidence processing. When fit to participants’ behavioural responses alone, this model predicted their observed information usage patterns. This suggests that an initial ‘snapshot’ of information can have a lasting impact on the dynamics of the decision process, thus influencing later self-corrective behaviour.",1136,95,303,29.0

The results showed that L-arabinose deterred the feeding preferences of H. armigera caterpillars for its two host plants and two phagostimulants, the tobacco, the pepper, the sucrose and the fructose. Gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) sensitive to L-arabinose were not found in the peripheral maxillary sensilla of H. armigera caterpillars, but the sensitivities of GRNs sensitive to sucrose, fructose and tobacco saps were suppressed by the additions of L-arabinose. Exposure of H. armigera caterpillars to dietary L-arabinose resulted in a prolonged larval developmental duration, a suppressed activity of intestinal sucrase and a reduced glucose level in midgut. In vitro, L-arabinose inhibited activities of the intestinal sucrase of H. armigera caterpillars in an uncompetitive manner.

Finally, we (iii) present a case study where two generations of tag were deployed using different attachment procedures on red-tailed tropicbirds Phaethon rubricauda foraging in different seasons.Bench tests showed that individual acceleration axes required a two-level correction (representing up to 4.3% of the total value) to eliminate measurement error. This resulted in DBA differences of up to 5% between calibrated and uncalibrated tags for humans walking at different speeds. Device position was associated with greater variation in DBA, with upper- and lower back-mounted tags in pigeons varying by 9%, and tail- and back-mounted tags varying by 13% in kittiwakes. Finally, DBA varied by 25% in tropicbirds between seasons, which may be attributable to tag attachment procedures.Accelerometer accuracy, tag placement, and attachment details critically affect the signal amplitude and thereby the ability of the system to detect biologically meaningful phenomena. We propose a simple method to calibrate accelerometers that should be used prior to deployments and archived with resulting data, suggest a way that researchers can assess accuracy in previously collected data, and caution that variable tag placement and attachment can increase sensor noise and even generate trends that have no biological meaning.",861,39,70,23.0

Prediction capacities of seven machine learning algorithms (Generalized Linear Model with Stepwise Feature Selection, random forest, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel, Bayesian Generalized Linear Model, Neural network, K-nearest neighbour, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) were evaluated from daily feeding data collected from 65 pens originating from two herds of grower-finisher pigs (25-100kg), in which 27 tail biting events occurred. Data were divided into training and testing data in two different ways, either by randomly splitting data into 75% (training set) and 25% (testing set), or by randomly selecting pens to constitute the testing set. In the first data splitting, the model is regularly updated with previous data from the pen, whereas in the second data splitting, the model tries to predict for a pen that it has never seen before. The K-nearest neighbour algorithm was able to predict 78% of the upcoming events with an accuracy of 96%, when predicting events in pens for which it had previous data. The detection of events for unknown pens was less sensitive, and the neural network model was able to detect 14% of the upcoming events with an accuracy of 63%.

Recent work has shown that explicitly augmenting artificial agents with such graph-structured representations endows them with more human-like capabilities of compositionality and transfer learning. An open question is how humans acquire these representations. Previously, it has been shown that humans can learn to navigate graph-structured conceptual spaces on the basis of direct experience with trajectories that intentionally draw the network contours (Schapiro et al., 2012;2016), or through direct experience with rewards that covary with the underlying associative distance (Wu et al., 2018). Here, we provide initial evidence that this capability is more general, extending to learning to reason about shortest-path distances across a graph structure acquired across disjoint experiences with randomized edges of the graph - a form of latent learning. In other words, we show that humans can infer graph structures, assembling them from disordered experiences. We further show that the degree to which individuals learn to reason correctly and with reference to the structure of the graph corresponds to their propensity, in a separate task, to use model-based reinforcement learning to achieve rewards. This connection suggests that the correct acquisition of graph-structured relationships is a central ability underlying forward planning and reasoning, and may be a core computation across the many domains in which graph-based reasoning is advantageous.",2350,295,720,42.0

Optimal pellet size for feeding was defined according to the behavioural responses and ingestion of pellets with different diameters (2, 4, 6, 8 mm) that were dropped into the tank in a random sequence. Larger pellets (6 and 8 mm) were more attractive (lower reaction time, high percentage of capture), but the small to medium-sized pellets (2 and 4 mm) were consumed the most. The optimal size was the 2- and 4- mm pellet diameter for juvenile individuals (365.50 ± 36.90 g; 28.8 ± 0.84 cm) and the 4-mm diameter pellet for adults (937.49 ± 146.54 g; 40 ± 1.12 cm). The preferred feeding area of adult mullet was also studied to estimate preference in relation to pellet characteristics such as floating or sink. Two pellet types, floating or sinking, were offered simultaneously in the water column: at the surface, mid-water column and bottom of the tank.

Episodic memory is an essential function of the human being related to the ability to store and remember experiences and anticipate possible events in the future. Studying this function in this context is crucial to help understand what effects the pandemic will have on the formation of episodic memories. To study this, the formation of episodic memories was evaluated by free recall, recognition, and episode order tasks for an aversive and neutral content. The results indicated that aversive episodic memory is impaired both in the free recall task and in the recognition task. Even the beneficial effect that emotional memory usually has for the episodic order was undermined as there were no differences between the neutral and aversive condition. The present work adds to the evidence that indicates that the level of activation does not modify memory processes in a linear way, which also depends on the type of evocation that people are asked and the characteristics of the content to be encoded.",1030,39,101,38.0

We find that academics adopt different definitions of behavior according to their academic discipline, animal model that they work with, and level of academic seniority.

Despite the ubiquity and importance of this trait, the molecular mechanisms underlying repeatable individual differences in neophobia in wild animals are poorly understood. We evaluated wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus) for neophobia in the lab using novel object tests. We then selected the most and least neophobic individuals (n=3 of each) and extracted RNA from four brain regions involved in learning, memory, threat perception, and executive function: striatum, dorsomedial hippocampus, medial ventral arcopallium, and caudolateral nidopallium (NCL). Our analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) used 11,889 gene regions annotated in the house sparrow reference genome for which we had an average of 25.7 million mapped reads/sample. PERMANOVA identified significant effects of brain region, phenotype (neophobic vs. non-neophobic), and a brain region by phenotype interaction. Comparing neophobic and non-neophobic birds revealed constitutive differences in DEGs in three of the four brain regions examined: hippocampus (12% of the transcriptome significantly differentially expressed), striatum (4%) and NCL (3%). DEGs included important known neuroendocrine mediators of learning, memory, executive function, and anxiety behavior, including serotonin receptor 5A, dopamine receptors 1, 2 and 5 (downregulated in neophobic birds), and estrogen receptor beta (upregulated in neophobic birds). These results suggest that some of the behavioral differences between phenotypes may be due to underlying gene expression differences in the brain. The large number of DEGs in neophobic and non-neophobic birds also implies that there are major differences in neural function between the two phenotypes that could affect a wide variety of behavioral traits beyond neophobia.",958,31,101,39.0

The benefits and limitations of four different enclosure use indices; Original and Modified Spread of Participation Index, Entropy, and Electivity Index were compared. Three artificial data sets were developed to represent the challenges commonly found in animal exhibits, and these indices were applied to these contrived enclosure settings. Three of the indices (Original SPI, Modified SPI, and Entropy) were used to assess a single measure of enclosure use variability. When zones within an exhibit were comparable in size, all three indices performed similarly. However, with less equal zone sizes, Modified SPI outperformed Original SPI and Entropy, suggesting that the Modified formula was more useful for assessing overall enclosure use variability under such conditions. Electivity Index assessed the use of individual zones, rather than the variability of use across the entire exhibit, and therefore could not be compared directly to the other three indices.

In this study, using order place association task where the animal learns to associate the location of the food pellet to the order of entry into the event arena, we probe the nature of temporal order memory in mice. In our task, individual trials, become distinct events, as the animal is trained to form unique association between entry order and a correct location. The inter-trial intervals (&gt; 30 mins) are chosen deliberately to minimise the working memory contributions. We develop this paradigm initially using 4 order place associates and later extend it to 5 paired associates. Our results show that animals not only acquire these explicit (entry order to place) associations but also higher order associations that can only be inferred implicitly from the temporal order of these events. As an indicator of such higher order learning during the probe trail the mice exhibit predominantly prospective errors that declines proportionally with temporal distance. On the other hand, prior to acquiring the sequence the retrospective errors are dominant. Additionally, we also tested the nature of such acquisitions when temporal order CS is presented along with flavour as a compound stimulus comprising of order and flavour both simultaneously being paired with location. Results from these experiments indicate that the animal learns both order-place and flavour-place associations. Comparing with pure order place training, we find that the additional flavour in compound training did not interfere with the ability of the animals to acquire the order place associations. When tested remotely, pure order place associations could be retrieved only after a reminder training. Further higher order associations representing the temporal relationship between the events is markedly absent in the remote time.",836,35,92,53.0

Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal’s performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (Ptpn11 D61G and Ptpn11 N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of Noonan syndrome, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327.

These patterns may emerge by self-organization from simple interactions among group-members. Computational models have been shown to be valuable for identifying the behavioral rules that may govern these interactions among individuals during collective motion. However, our knowledge of such rules for collective escape is limited by the lack of quantitative data on bird flocks under predation in the field. In the present study, we analyze the first dataset of GPS trajectories of pigeons in airborne flocks attacked by a robotic falcon in order to build a species-specific model of collective escape. We use our model to examine a recently identified distance-dependent pattern of collective behavior that shows an increase in the escape frequency of pigeons when the predator is closer. We first extract from the empirical data the characteristics of pigeon flocks regarding their shape and internal structure (bearing angle and distance to nearest neighbours). Combining these with information on their coordination from the literature, we build an agent-based model tuned to pigeons’ collective escape. We show that the pattern of increased escape frequency closer to the predator arises without flock-members prioritizing escape when the predator is near. Instead, it emerges through self-organization from an individual rule of predator-avoidance that is independent of predator-prey distance. During this self-organization process, we uncover a role of hysteresis and show that flock members increase their consensus over the escape direction and turn collectively as the predator gets closer. Our results suggest that coordination among flock-members, combined with simple escape rules, reduces the cognitive costs of tracking the predator. Such rules that are independent of predator-prey distance can now be examined in other species. Finally, we emphasize on the important role of computational models in the interpretation of empirical findings of collective behavior.Author summary Bird flocks show fascinating patterns of collective motion, particularly when escaping a predator. Little is however known about their underlying mechanisms. We fill this gap by firstly analyzing GPS data of pigeon flocks under attack by a robotic-predator and secondly, studying their collective escape in a computer simulation. Previous research on pigeons has revealed that flock-members turn away from the predator more the closer the predator gets. Using computer simulations that are based on pigeon-specific characteristics of motion and coordination among individuals, we study what escape rules at the individual level may underlie this distance-dependent pattern. We show that even if individuals do not intend to escape more when the predator is closer, their escape frequency still increases the closer they get to the predator. This happens by self-organization from the coordination among individuals and despite their tendency to turn away from the predator being constant. A key aspect of this process is the increasing consensus among flock members over the escape direction when the predator gets closer.",958,51,128,24.0

We found that females who provide more grooming to other group members survive longer. The association is stronger for older females. These benefits were independent of females’ rank, presence of their adult daughters and mothers, and their group size. Receiving more grooming from others showed a similar effect on survival, but confidence in the estimated effect was unclear. Participation in coalitionary aggression and foraging in close proximity of others were not predictive of increased survival.

Malaria declines have stagnated recently due to widespread insecticide resistance among vector populations. Flight acoustics are essential to mosquito mating biology and represent promising alternative targets for mosquito control. However, mosquito swarm acoustics data are limited. Here, for the first time, we present detailed analyses of free-flying male and female An. gambiae flight tones and their harmonization (harmonic convergence) over a complete swarm sequence. Audio analysis of single-sex swarms showed elevated male or female flight tone frequencies and amplitudes during swarming flight with gradual declines to pre-swarm levels over an approximately 35-min period. Analysis of mixed-sex swarms revealed additional increases in flight tone frequencies and amplitudes due to mating activity. Data from mixed-sex swarms suggest harmonic convergence during swarming enhances the efficiency of female detection by synchronizing male and female baseline swarm tones. Further, data from experiments using female swarm tone playbacks to males indicate that harmonic convergence during mating interactions coordinates male scramble competition by acoustically masking mating couple flight tones.

Investment in multi-sensory integration and motor requirements for task performance was estimated to be greatest for media workers whose leaf-harvesting repertoire involves the most diverse and demanding sensory and motor processes, including plant discrimination, leaf cutting, and fragment transportation. Volumetric analysis of confocal brain images revealed that absolute brain size increased with worker size and compartmental scaling allometries among functionally specialized brain compartments differed among polymorphic workers. The mushroom bodies, centers of sensory integration and learning, and the antennal lobes, which process olfactory inputs, were significantly larger in medias than in minim workers (fungal gardeners) and major workers (“soldiers”), which had lower estimated task-related neural demands.

It is uncertain, however, how the stress system contributes to the phenomenon of time-dependent fear generalization. Here, we investigated whether post-training corticosterone (CORT-HBC) injections, given after different training intensities, affect contextual fear memory specificity at several time points. We trained male Wistar rats on the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task using two footshock intensities (mild CFC, 3 footshocks of 0.3 mA, or moderate CFC, 3x 0.6 mA) and immediately after the training session we administered CORT-HBC systemically. We first tested the animals in a novel context and then in the training context at different intervals following training (2, 14, 28 or 42 days). By measuring freezing in the novel context and then contrasting freezing times shown in both contexts, we inferred contextual fear generalization for each rat, classifying them into Generalizers or Discriminators. Following mild CFC training, the glucocorticoid injection promoted an accurate contextual memory at the recent time point (2 days), and increase the contextual memory accuracy 28 days after training. In contrast, after the moderate CFC training, CORT-HBC facilitated contextual generalization at 14 days, compared to the control group that maintained contextual discrimination at this timepoint. For this training intensity, however, CORT-HBC did not have any effect on recent memory specificity. These findings indicate that treatment with CORT-HBC immediately after the encoding of mild or moderately arousing experiences may differentially modulate memory consolidation and time-dependent fear generalization.HIGHLIGHTS- Rats were trained in a contextual fear task and tested for fear generalization.- Corticosterone (CORT) injected after a mild training promoted accuracy up to 28 days.- CORT injected after a moderate training facilitated time-dependent fear generalization.",990,79,184,33.0

When exposed to specific odorants during a timely controlled post-hatch period, C. elegans worms display during adulthood an enhanced migration towards these molecules. In order to unveil some of the genetic and epigenetic factors that are responsible for such a behavioural plasticity, we assessed the role of heterochronic genes using a candidate gene approach. We report here that translation of the Hunchback-Like 1 (HBL1) transcription factor in the sensory processing interneuron AIY, is a determining factor for olfactory plasticity timing in C.elegans. HBL1 may associate to the SPR1/CoREST co-repressor, the lysine demethylase SPR5/LSD1 and the histone deacetylase HDA3 to lengthen the plasticity period, whereas the translation initiation factor IFE-4 and the histone deacetylase HDA2 abridge it. We also observed that lengthened plasticity periods allow proportionally faster stable behavioral adaptation of C. elegans populations. We conclude that plasticity timing is a key factor, not only to transiently adapt individuals but also to stably adapt animal populations via multigenerational accumulation of experience.",637,43,81,31.0

Song, like in other songbird species, is generally described as a male trait and plays an important role in mate attraction and territory defence. Over the decades, there have been recurring reports of anecdotal female song but these have not led to any quantitative study of female song in blue tits. Our systematic sampling over three years revealed prolific female singing in a northern population of colour ringed blue tits. Daytime singing of females occurred throughout the breeding season during agonistic interactions, solo songs and alarm situations, and these contexts are similar to male song. Notably, female song was absent during the dawn chorus; the period around sunrise when males sing intensively just before mating. Female and male song overlapped substantially in acoustic structure (i.e. same song types, peak frequency or trill rates) but there were also significant differences in that females had smaller repertoires, shorter trills and lower vocal consistency. Differential selections pressures related with contextual (functional) differences in the role of male and female song could explain the observed differences in acoustic structure. The new finding of prolific female singing in such a well-studied species suggests we ought to revise our understanding of male and female vocal communication in this (and probably other) species. Identifying the selection pressures associated to the convergence versus divergence of male and female song may provide important insight in understanding birdsong evolution.Lay summary Female song has been anecdotally reported in blue tits but there are no quantitative studies of singing behaviour, song structure or context. Here, we report frequent female singing in blue tits, associated mostly with agonistic interactions and alarm situations. Importantly, female song was not observed during dawn chorus, the period around sunrise when males sing intensively just before mating. Female and male song overlapped substantially in acoustic structure (i.e. same song types) but there were also significant differences (i.e. females sang with lower vocal consistency).

Despite early recognition that subjects may engage in a variety of behaviors that reflect the experimental parameters of a given protocol, the last several decades have seen the field narrow its focus to measure freezing as the sole indicator of conditioned fear. Additionally, unconditioned responses such as shock-related activity are rarely considered. We previously reported that female Sprague Dawley rats are more likely than males to engage in darting, an escape-like conditioned response that is associated with heightened shock reactivity, but we did not establish whether darting was sensitive to manipulations of factors such as chamber size, shock intensity, or number of trials. Our goal here was to address these questions by defining parametric and phenotypic predictors of darting in both sexes. To better capture fear-related behavioral repertoires in our animals, we developed ScaredyRat, a custom Python tool that analyzes Noldus Ethovision-generated raw data files to identify Darters and quantify both conditioned and unconditioned responses. We find that like freezing, darting probability scales with experimental alterations in multiple dimensions.

The key questions revolve around to what extent perceptual and linguistic processes determine categories. While prelinguistic infants and animals appear to treat color categorically, several recent attempts to model category formation have successfully utilized communicative concepts to predict color categories. Considering this apparent discrepancy, we take a different approach. Rather than modeling categories directly, we focus on the potential emergence of color categories as the result of acquiring basic visual skills. For this, we investigated whether color is represented categorically in a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects in natural images. We systematically trained novel output layers to the CNN for a color classification task, and found that clear borders arise between novel (non-training) colors that are largely invariant to the training colors. We confirmed these border locations by searching for the optimal border placement using an evolutionary algorithm that relies on the principle of categorical perception. Our findings also extend to stimuli with multiple, colored, words of varying color contrast, as well as colored objects with larger colored surfaces. These results provide strong evidence that color categorization can emerge with the development of object recognition.Significance statement The origin of color categories has been a controversial topic for a long time, the key question being to what extent perceptual and linguistic processes determine categories. Typically, this has been evaluated by modeling the shape of categories directly. Here, we take a very different approach and evaluate categorization in a neural network built for recognizing objects in natural scenes. Interestingly, the network appears to build a categorical representation of color as a side effect of learning to classify objects. This shows categorization may be driven by acquiring basic visual skills, particularly those pertaining to objects.",502,37,42,21.0

The goal of this experiment was to determine whether the behavioral response to ketamine depends on intact HPA axis function. Male and female C57BL/6J mice underwent chronic unpredictable stress prior to ketamine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle treatment, with or without the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (20 mg/kg, i.p.) to block adrenal corticosterone production. Mice were tested in the forced swim test (FST) and open field test one and two days after injection, respectively. Fecal corticosterone was measured at select time points. No significant drug effects on behavior were observed. Males consistently had higher fecal corticosterone levels and stress-induced increases than females. Ketamine lowered the fecal corticosterone response to the FST only in males. These data show that ketamine after chronic stress decreases the corticosterone response to a novel stressor (the FST) in males, but not females. Corticosterone levels in all mice correlated with immobility in the FST, suggesting that shared neural circuitry could mediate both endocrine and behavioral responses. This circuitry may be ketamine-responsive only in males.",1064,42,82,15.0

Behaviours like active scanning or head lifting are usually used to quantify vigilance, but may not be accurate measures as the individual could be conducting them for other purposes. We suggest that measuring an animal’s blinking rate gives a meaningful measure of vigilance: increased blinking implies reduced vigilance, as the animal cannot detect predators when its eyes are closed. We demonstrate that as group size increases in red deer, individuals increase their blink rate, confirming the prediction that vigilance should decrease. Blinking is a simple non-invasive measure, and offers a useful metric for assessing the welfare of animals experiencing an increase in perceived predation risk or other stressors.",1601,312,336,16.0

Here we show that this does not hold for marmosets interacting with a familiar experimenter who suddenly establishes eye contact in a playful interaction (“peek-a-boo”). In video footage synchronously recorded from the two agents, we found that our monkeys consistently alternated between eye contact and head-gaze aversion. The striking similarity with the gaze aversion’s dynamics exhibited by human infants interacting with their caregivers suggests a shared behavioral strategy to disengage temporarily from overwhelming social stimulation, in order to prepare for a new round of rewarding, affiliative face-to-face interaction.

Few models explain why human networks shrink with age, despite the risk that small networks and isolation pose. We evaluate models grounded in a life history perspective by studying social aging in wild chimpanzees, which are long-lived and show physical decline with age.Methodology We applied social network analysis to examine age-related changes in social integration in a 7+ year mixed-longitudinal dataset comprised of 38 wild adult chimpanzees (22 F, 16 M) in the Kanyawara community in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. Metrics of social integration included social attractivity and overt effort (directed degree and strength), gregariousness (undirected strength), social roles (betweenness and local transitivity), and embeddedness (eigenvector centrality) in grooming and spatial association networks.Results Males reduced overt social effort yet increased in attractivity, roles in cliques, and embeddedness. Females were overall less integrated than males, and their decreased integration with age suggested social avoidance. Effects of age were largely independent of rank. Both sexes maintained highly repeatable inter-individual differences in several aspects of integration, particularly among mixed-sex partners.Conclusions and implications As in humans, chimpanzees experience age-related declines in social effort. However, important facets of integration aged more similarly to humans in non-industrialized vs. industrialized societies, suggesting an evolutionary social mismatch between conserved declines in effort and dynamics of industrialized society. Lastly, individual and sex differences have the potential to be important mediators of successful social aging in chimpanzees, as in humans.",1084,42,104,60.0

Current approaches to understanding these behaviors model evolution as an optimization problem in which the traits of organisms are assumed to optimize an objective function representing evolutionary fitness. Here, we use a mechanistic birth-death dynamics approach to study the evolution of innate behavioral strategies in a population of organisms in silico. In particular, we performed agent-based stochastic simulations and mean-field analyses of organisms exploring random environments and competing with each other to find locations with plentiful resources. We find that when organism density is low, the mean-field model allows us to derive an effective objective function, predicting how the most competitive phenotypes depend on the exploration-exploitation trade-off between the scarcity of high-resource sites and the increase in birth rate those sites offer organisms. However, increasing organism density alters the most competitive behavioral strategies and precludes the existence of a well-defined objective function. Moreover, there exists a range of densities for which the coexistence of many phenotypes persists for evolutionarily long times.",1138,36,129,32.0

But in nature, rewards earned by work are essential to survival (e.g., working to find water), and the payoff of that work can vary on long timescales (e.g., seasonally). Under these constraints, the strategy of working less when rewards are small could be fatal. We found that instead, rats in a closed economy did more work for water rewards when the rewards were stably smaller, a phenomenon also observed in human labor supply curves. Like human consumers, rats also showed elasticity of demand, consuming far more water per day when its price in effort was lower. The neural mechanisms underlying such “rational” market behaviors remain largely unexplored. We propose a dynamic utility maximization model that can account for the dependence of rat labor supply (trials/day) on the wage rate (ml/trial), and also predict the temporal dynamics of when rats work.

Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms in three regions of the brain (fore-, mid-, and hindbrain) during the interaction of these fishes. Here we show, using transcriptomics, that most of the transcriptional response in both species was regulated in the hindbrain and forebrain regions and that the interacting behaviour responses of L. dimidiatus involved immediate early gene alteration, dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways, the expression of neurohormones (such as isotocin) and steroids (e.g. progesterone and estrogen), as well as social decision-making genes. In contrast, in the client, fewer molecular alterations were found, mostly involving pituitary hormone responses. The particular pathways found suggested learning and memory processes in the cleaner wrasse, while the client indicated stress relief and a reduction in aggression.",1291,55,205,23.0

Using game theory we investigate how the opportunity for differently ranked individuals to acquire resources influences reproductive skew, costs of hierarchy formation, and winner and loser effects. Individuals adjust their aggressive and submissive behaviour through reinforcement learning. The learning is based on perceived rewards and penalties, which depend on relative fighting ability. From individualbased simulations we determine evolutionary equilibria of traits that control an individual’s learning. We examine situations that differ in the extent of monopolisation of contested resources by dominants and in the amounts of uncontested resources that are distributed independently of rank. With costly fighting, we find that stable dominance hierarchies form, such that reproductive skew mirrors the distribution of resources over ranks. Individuals pay substantial costs of interacting, in particular in high-skew situations, with the highest costs paid by intermediately ranked individuals. For cases where dominants monopolise contested resources there are notable winner and loser effects, with winner effects for high ranks and very pronounced loser effects for lower ranks. The effects are instead weak when acquired resources increase linearly with rank.

Drosophila larva executes crawls, turns, and pauses to explore the substrate and find food sources. This exploration has to be flexible in the face of changes in the quality of food so that larvae feed in patches with favorable food and look for another source when the current location does not fulfill their nutritional needs. But which behavioral elements adapt, and what triggers those changes remain elusive. Using experiments and modeling, we investigate the foraging behavior of larvae in homogeneous environments with different food types and in environments where the food sources are patchy. Our work indicates that the speed of larval crawling and frequency of pauses is modulated by the food quality. Interestingly, we found that the genetic dimorphism in the foraging gene influences the exploratory behavior only when larvae crawl on yeast patches. While in a homogeneous substrate larvae maintain a turning bias in a specific orientation, in a patchy substrate larvae orient themselves towards the food when the patch border is reached. Therefore, by adapting different elements in their foraging behavior, larvae either increase the time inside nutritious food patches or continue exploring the substrate in less nutritious environments.",1042,32,162,40.0

To understand how figure-ground organization emerges, it is essential to investigate how the global configuration of an image is reflected. In the past, many neuro- computational models developed to reproduce figure-ground organization implemented algorithms to give a bias to convex areas. However, in certain conditions, a convex area can be perceived as a hole and a non-convex area as figural. This occurs when the surface properties of the convex area are consistent with the background and, hence, are grouped together in our perception. We argue that large-scale consistency of surface properties is reflected in the border-ownership computation. We developed a model, called DISC2, that first analyzes relationships between two border-ownership signals of all possible combinations in the image. It then enhances signals if they satisfy the following conditions: 1. the two signals fit to a convex configuration, and 2. the surface properties at the locations of the two signals are consistent. The strength of the enhancement decays with distance between the signals. The model gives extremely robust responses to various images with complexities both in shape and depth order. Furthermore, we developed an advanced version of the model (“augmented model”) where the global computation above interacts with local computation of curvilinearity, which further enhanced the robust nature of the model.

We investigated whether acute pulses of intranasal (IN) OXT influenced social behavior during social challenges that are likely to occur throughout the lifespan of a wild mouse. To test this, we examined the acute effects of IN OXT in the male California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), a monogamous, biparental, and territorial rodent, using a within-subjects longitudinal design. Social challenges included a pre-courtship male-female encounter conducted during the initial aggressive and not the following affiliative phase of courtship, same-sex resident intruder test, and parental care test, with each test and dose separated by at least two weeks. Males were treated with intranasal infusions of 0.8 IU/kg OXT or saline controls 5-min before each behavioral test, receiving a total of three treatments of either IN OXT or saline control. We predicted that IN OXT would 1) decrease aggression and increase affiliation during the pre-courtship aggression phase, 2) increase aggression during resident intruder paradigms and 3) increase paternal care and vocalizations during a paternal care test. As predicted, during pre-courtship aggression with a novel female, IN OXT males displayed less contact aggression than control males, although with no change in affiliative behavior. However, post-pairing, during the resident intruder test, IN OXT males did not differ from control males in contact aggression. During the paternal care test, IN OXT males were quicker to approach their pups than control males but did not differ in vocalizations produced, unlike our previous research demonstrating an effect on vocalizations in females. In summary, during pre-courtship aggression and the paternal care test, IN OXT promoted prosocial approach; however, during the resident intruder test IN OXT did not alter social approach. These data suggest that IN OXT promotes prosocial approach specifically in social contexts that can lead to affiliation.HIGHLIGHTSIN OXT attenuates male aggression during pre-courtship encountersIN OXT does not attenuate male aggression during resident intruder encountersIN OXT increases paternal responsiveness during a paternal care challengeIN OXT in fathers does not influence total paternal care or vocalizations",1108,22,103,36.0

One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission, because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts is often associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social structure of a group or population has been shown to be paramount to patterns of infection and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the social transmission of parasites in animals, and especially in primates, have only taken into account parts of the group (e.g., only adults or even only adult females), which is likely to impact the interpretation of any results linking sociality and parasitism. Here, we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a complete group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact of missing parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test: (1) whether social network centrality – the number of partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength) and level of social integration (eigenvector) – was linked to parasite infection intensity; and, (2) to what extent excluding all or portions of individuals within the group from the analyses might influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network analysis on data collected from one complete group of Japanese macaques over two months on Koshima Island, Japan, to relate metrics of network centrality to an index of parasite infection intensity (eggs per gram of feces: EPG). We then ran a series of knock-out simulations to test the effect(s) of accounting only for certain age-sex classes on the observed relationship. General linear mixed models showed that, in the complete network, centrality was positively associated with infection by the examined geohelminths (Oesophagostomum aculeatum, Trichuris trichiura and Strongyloides fuelleborni), but in partial networks with only adult females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of this relationship - albeit still positive - lost statistical significance. Our study indicates that sampling bias can impact the relationship that is observed between social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting earlier results linking geohelminths to Japanese macaque social networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with applications to infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health interventions.",1376,64,167,35.0

As anthropogenic disturbances rapidly degrade the quality of many habitats, site-attached animals are facing additional stressors that may alter the trade-offs of moving or remaining philopatric. Here we examined how habitat health, size and saturation affect movement decisions of a coral-dwelling goby, Gobiodon quinquestrigatus, that resides within bleaching-susceptible Acropora coral hosts. To assess effects of habitat health, we translocated individuals far from their home corals into dead corals with the choice of adjacent healthy corals. To assess effects of habitat size and saturation, we manipulated coral sizes and the number of residents in healthy corals. Remarkably, 55% of gobies returned home regardless of treatment, 7% stayed in the new coral, and the rest were not found. Contrary to expectations, habitat factors did not affect how costs of movement influence group-living decisions in this species. These site-attached fishes preferred to home instead of choosing alternative habitat, which suggests a surprising awareness of their ecological surroundings. However, disregarding alternative high-quality habitat is concerning as it may affect population persistence under conditions of rapid habitat degradation.",1001,9,61,12.0

These behavioral shifts may be an adaptive response to urbanization, but it may be costly if animals in urban areas also exhibit reduced anti-predator behavior in the presence of natural predators. In trials with only a human observer as the stimulus, urban squirrels exhibited reduced vigilance and anti-predator behavior compared to those in less urban areas. Next, we exposed squirrels in multiple urban and less urban sites to acoustic playbacks of a control stimulus (non-predatory bird calls), a natural predator (hawk), and dogs and recorded their vigilance and three different anti-predator behaviors when a human approached them while either broadcasting one of these three playbacks or no playbacks at all. Squirrels at urban sites also did not differ in their behavioral responses to the playbacks from possible predators (hawks or dogs) when they were compared to those at less urban sites exposed to these playbacks. Urban squirrels also exhibited increased vigilance and anti-predator behavior when exposed to a human paired with hawk playbacks compared to the control playbacks. Together, our results indicate that urban squirrels did perceive and assess risk to the natural predator appropriately despite exhibiting increased tolerance to humans. These results provide little support for the hypothesis that increased tolerance to humans causes animals to lose their fear of natural predators.",1369,314,299,46.0

Oxytocin (OT) context-dependently regulates social affiliation and vocal communication, but its role in pair members’ decision to jointly respond to challenge is unclear. To test for OT effects, California mouse females received an intranasal dose of OT (IN-OT) or saline after bonding with males either matched or in their approach response to an aggressive vocal challenge. Pair mates were re-tested jointly for approach response, time spent together, and vocalizations. Females and males converged in their approach after pairing, but mismatched pairs with females given a single dose of IN-OT displayed a greater convergence that resulted from behavioral changes by both pair members. Unpaired females given IN-OT did not change their approach, indicating a social partner was necessary for effects to emerge. Moreover, IN-OT increased time spent approaching together, suggesting behavioral coordination beyond a further increase in bonding. This OT-induced increase in joint approach was associated with a decrease in the proportion of sustained vocalizations, a type of vocalization that can be associated with intra-pair conflict.

Here, we measured short-term space use in non-territorial, non-migratory cane toads (Rhinella marina) in their native range in French Guiana. After establishing home range, we tested their ability to return to home following translocations of 500 and 1000 meters. Toads were able to travel in straight trajectories back to home areas, suggesting map-like navigational abilities similar to those observed in amphibians with more complex spatial behavior. These observations break with the current paradigm of amphibian navigation and suggest that navigational abilities may be widely shared among amphibians.",911,34,92,20.0

One common approach applied in language sciences to identify recurrent word combinations is collocation analysis. Through comparing the co-occurrence of two words with how each word combines with other words within a corpus, collocation analysis can highlight above chance, two-word combinations. Here, we demonstrate how this approach can also be applied to non-human animal communication systems by implementing it on a pseudo dataset.

Sequence models learn to map behavioral features extracted from video frames to discrete behaviors, and both supervised and unsupervised methods are common. However, each approach has its drawbacks: supervised models require a time-consuming annotation step where humans must hand label the desired behaviors; unsupervised models may fail to accurately segment particular behaviors of interest. We introduce a semi-supervised approach that addresses these challenges by constructing a sequence model loss function with (1) a standard supervised loss that classifies a sparse set of hand labels; (2) a weakly supervised loss that classifies a set of easy-to-compute heuristic labels; and (3) a self-supervised loss that predicts the evolution of the behavioral features.

In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), for example, learning song requires dynamic social interactions with a “tutor” during an early sensitive period. The oxytocin system plays a central role in social orienting across species, yet it is unknown whether this system participates in the attentional and motivational processes that support vocal learning. Here, we tested whether blocking oxytocin receptors during exposure to tutors would impact learning from those tutors. Juvenile, song-naïve males were each tutored by two unfamiliar adults. During exposure to one tutor, juveniles were treated with oxytocin receptor antagonist (OTA) and during exposure to the other, saline (control). We found that OTA significantly reduced behaviors associated with approach and attention during tutoring sessions. Next, using an operant assay in which exposure to the two songs was balanced, we found that the juveniles preferred the control song over the OTA song. The developmental trajectory of preference for the control song resembled the pattern shown by father-reared birds choosing to hear their father’s song. Finally, the adult songs of the tutored birds more closely resembled control song than OTA song. The magnitude of this difference was significantly predicted by the early preference for the control song. Overall, oxytocin antagonism during exposure to a tutor seemed to bias juveniles against that tutor and his song. Our results suggest that oxytocin receptors play a role in socially-guided vocal learning in zebra finches, perhaps by affecting attention and motivation during tutoring.",860,41,92,31.0

We observe a sexually dimorphic pattern of changes in the behavioral repertoire during aging.

However, it is not yet fully understood how these birds exploit hostile environments to their advantage. Casual observation seems to suggest that this species can obtain resources of biological importance such as food or nesting material from the trash. As a first approach to the problem, we located a patch outside a residential building, in a high-density urban area, where the residents left their trash for pick-up, and a group of wild Great-tailed grackles was identified as regular visitors. In total, 25 days were recorded at the site (November 2017 - January 2018). Events such as foraging, number of subjects present at the foraging site, aggressive behaviors between members of the group, and their relation with the presence or absence of the garbage collector truck were registered. The results show a higher number of grackles at the observation site and a higher frequency of foraging behaviors in the presence of garbage collection than in its absence. In its presence, the distribution of foraging during the day follows a normal distribution. In the absence, the distribution shows more variability towards the day. The highest frequency of interactions occurred between two grackles, yet there were records of up to eight subjects. The highest number of aggressions registered took place in the absence of garbage collection than in its presence. Moreover, the focal subject exhibits fewer agonistic behaviors compared to other members of the group, a result expected if the producer-scrounger game literature is considered. The outcome is explained in terms of deprivation and availability of resources. Finally, we conclude that grackles can exploit hazardous environments such as cities due to the highly social behaviors exhibited during foraging.",893,27,119,28.0

However, it is unclear whether associability enhancements reflect increased associative plasticity within a particular behavior system, or whether they can facilitate learning between a cue and any arbitrary outcome, as suggested by attentional models of conditioning. Here, we show evidence consistent with the latter hypothesis. Violating the outcome expectancies generated by a cue in an appetitive setting (feeding behavior system) facilitated subsequent learning about the cue in an aversive setting (defense behavior system). In addition to shedding light on the nature of associability enhancements, our findings offer the neuroscientist a behavioral tool to dissociate their neural substrates from those of other, behavior system- or valence-specific changes. Moreover, our results present an opportunity to utilize associability enhancements to the advantage of counterconditioning procedures in therapeutic contexts.",914,32,138,22.0

Beck, Jacob L. Yates, Ralf M. Haefner",440321;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/440321,"Making good decisions requires updating beliefs according to new evidence. This is a dynamical process that is prone to biases: in some cases, beliefs become entrenched and resistant to new evidence (leading to primacy effects), while in other cases, beliefs fade over time and rely primarily on later evidence (leading to recency effects). How and why either type of bias dominates in a given context is an important open question. Here, we study this question in classic perceptual decision-making tasks, where, puzzlingly, previous empirical studies differ in the kinds of biases they observe, ranging from primacy to recency, despite seemingly equivalent tasks. We present a new model, based on hierarchical approximate inference and derived from normative principles, that not only explains both primacy and recency effects in existing studies, but also predicts how the type of bias should depend on the statistics of stimuli in a given task. We verify this prediction in a novel visual discrimination task with human observers, finding that each observer’s temporal bias changed as the result of changing the key stimulus statistics identified by our model. By fitting an extended drift-diffusion model to our data we rule out an alternative explanation for primacy effects due to bounded integration. Taken together, our results resolve a major discrepancy among existing perceptual decision-making studies, and suggest that a key source of bias in human decision-making is approximate hierarchical inference.",5367,721,1969,30.0

However, it has been pointed out that in human migratory behavior, the step length series may have temporal correlation (i.e., it is not random walk) and that there is some relationship between this time dependency and the fact that the frequency distribution of step length follows the power-law distribution. Furthermore, some large marine organisms have been found to switch between Lévy and Brownian walks, wherein the frequency of occurrence of the step length is characterized by an exponential distribution (EP), depending on the difficulty of prey acquisition. However, as of now it has not been clarified how the aforementioned three phenomena arise: the positive correlation created in the step length series, the relation between the positive correlation of the step length series and the form of an individual’s step length distribution, and the switching between Lévy and Brownian behavior depending on the abundance of prey. The purpose of this study is to simulate foraging behavior by three Bayesian decision-making agents: an agent simultaneously performing both knowledge learning and knowledge-based inference, an agent performing only learning, an agent performing only inference, and to analyze how the aforementioned three phenomena arise. The simulation results show that only the agent with both learning and inference has a mechanism that simultaneously causes all the phenomena. This suggests that simultaneous learning on prey distribution and inference based on the knowledge gained in exploratory behavior under incomplete information may be the key to the emergence of Lévy walk-like patterns found in humans and marine organisms.",1397,62,143,46.0

Although wind and hunger are closely linked to olfaction, neither had much effect on single-class responses. Several pooling rules have been invoked to explain how ORN types combine their behavioral influences; we activated two-way combinations and compared patterns of single- and double-ORN responses: these comparisons were inconsistent with simple pooling.

As other preclinical work suggests the female rodent brain may be relatively resistant to charged particle-induced injury, and as the proportion of female vs. male astronauts is increasing, further study on how charged particles influence the touchscreen cognitive performance of female mice is warranted. We hypothesized that, similar to mature male mice, mature female C57BL/6J mice exposed to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (3 × 6.7cGy 56Fe over 5 days, 600MeV/n) would improve performance vs.Sham conditions in touchscreen tasks relevant to hippocampal and prefrontal cortical function (e.g. location discrimination reversal [LDR] and extinction, respectively). In LDR, 56Fe female mice more accurately discriminated two discrete conditioned stimuli relative to Sham mice, suggesting improved hippocampal function. However, 56Fe and Sham female mice acquired a new simple stimulus-response behavior and extinguished this acquired behavior at similar rates, suggesting similar prefrontal cortical function. Based on prior work on multiple memory systems, we next tested whether improved hippocampal-dependent function (discrimination learning) came at the expense of striatal rule-based learning (visuomotor conditional learning). Interestingly, 56Fe female mice took more days to reach criteria in this striatal-dependent rule-based test relative to Sham mice. Together, our data support the idea of competition between memory systems, as an 56Fe-induced decrease in striatal-based learning is associated with enhanced hippocampal-based learning.

We examine the alternative hypothesis that stimuli are encoded with noise, then optimally decoded. Under a model of efficient coding, the amount of noise should vary across stimuli, and depend on statistics of the stimuli. We investigate these predictions through a task in which participants are asked to compare the averages of two series of numbers, each sampled from a prior distribution that varies across blocks of trials. Subjects encode numbers with a bias and a noise that both depend on the number. Infrequently occurring numbers are encoded with more noise. We show how an efficient-coding, Bayesian-decoding model accounts for these patterns, and best captures subjects’ behaviour. Finally, our results suggest that Wei and Stocker’s “law of human perception”, which relates the bias and variability of sensory estimates, also applies to number cognition.",1846,217,596,30.0

However, it is unclear whether the discounted value of the large reward option is the main contributor to variability in animals’ choices in either task, which may limit translatability to human discounting data. Male and female mice underwent sessions of delay and probability discounting in sequence to assess how choice behavior adapts over experience with each task. To control for “anchoring” (persistent choices based on the initial delay or probability), mice experienced “Worsening” schedules where the large reward was offered under initially favorable delay or probability conditions that became less favorable during testing, followed by “Improving” schedules where the large reward was offered under initially unfavorable conditions that improved over a session. During delay discounting, both male and female mice showed elimination of anchoring effects over training. In probability discounting, both sexes of mice continued to show some anchoring even after months of training. One possibility is that noisy action selection could contribute to these anchoring effects, rather than persistent fluctuations in value discounting. We fit choice behavior in individual animals using models that included both a value-based discounting parameter and a decision noise parameter that captured variability in choices deviating from value maximization. Changes in anchoring behavior over time were tracked by changes in our decision noise parameter, not the value parameter. Thus, changes in discounting behavior in mice can result from changes in exploration of the environment rather than changes in reward valuation.",1040,51,100,36.0

CRS induced behavioral effects on anhedonia- and anxiety-like behaviors were measured using the sucrose intake and the PhenoTyper tests, respectively. PFC GFP+ or GFAP+ cells morphology was assessed using Sholl analysis and associations with behavior were determined using correlation analysis.Results CRS-exposed male and female mice displayed anxiety-like behavior at 7, 21 and 35 days and anhedonia-like behavior at 35 days. Analysis of GFAP+ cell morphology revealed significant atrophy of distal processes following 21 and 35 days of CRS. CRS induced similar decreases in intersections at distal radii for GFP+ cells, accompanied by increased proximal processes. In males, the number of intersections at the most distal radius step significantly correlated with anhedonia-like behavior (r=0.622, p&lt;0.05) for GFP+ cells and with behavioral emotionality calculated by z-scoring all behavioral measured deficits (r=-0.667, p&lt;0.05).

Shared mechanisms of color perception help explain consistent partitions of visible light into discrete color vocabularies (Regier et al., 2007). But the mappings from colors to words are not identical across languages, which may reflect communicative needs – how often speakers must refer to objects of different color (Gibson et al., 2017). Here we quantify the communicative needs of colors in 130 different languages by means of a novel inference algorithm. We find that communicative needs are not uniform: some regions of color space exhibit 30-fold greater demand for communication than other regions. The regions of greatest demand correlate with the colors of salient objects, including ripe fruits in primate diets. Our analysis also reveals a hidden diversity in the communicative needs of colors across different languages, which is partly explained by differences in geographic location and the local biogeography of linguistic communities. Accounting for language-specific, non-uniform communicative needs improves predictions for how a language maps colors to words, and how these mappings vary across languages.

The main difference is that there is, to date, no evidence for a vocal signature in the well-known 50- and 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) emitted by rats. Here, we show that rats can recognize the identity of the USV emitter since they self-administer preferentially playback of 50-kHz USV emitted by a stranger rat over those emitted by their cage-mate. In a second experiment, we show that the familiarity with the USV emitter also modulate the effect of USV playback during cocaine self-administration, since only stranger, but not familiar, 50-kHz USV decrease drug intake. Finally, to study the neurobiological substrate of those processes, we have tested the effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesion on these various conditions. STN-lesioned rats did not lever press much for any USV playback, whatever their emotional valence, nor did they seem able to differentiate familiar from stranger peer. Advocating for the existence of a vocal signature in rats, these results highlight the importance of ultrasonic communication in socio-affective influence of behavior, such as the influence of proximal social factors on drug consumption and confirm the role of the subthalamic nucleus on this influence.",1200,52,177,28.0

Mothers and non-mothers showed no significant differences on measures of objective cognition (verbal memory, short-term memory, working memory, processing speed or theory of mind). Despite the absence of objective differences, mothers self-reported significantly worse subjective memory than non-mothers. To interpret the difference between objective and subjective measures of memory, we investigated relationships between subjective memory, objective memory, and wellbeing. Mothers, but not non-mothers, showed a positive correlation between subjective and objective measures of memory, indicating mothers are more ‘in-tune’ with their memory performance than non-mothers. Mothers also demonstrated a positive relationship between subjective memory and wellbeing (sleep, anxiety and depression), where better wellbeing correlated with higher subjective memory. This relationship was not apparent in non-mothers. The results suggest that poorer sleep, higher anxiety and higher depression are related to reports of poorer subjective memory in mothers.

This has led to the adoption of several permutation-based methods for testing common hypotheses.One of the most common types of analysis is nodal regression, where the relationships between node-level network metrics and nodal covariates are analysed using a permutation technique known as node-label permutation. We show that, contrary to accepted wisdom, node-label permutations do not account for the types of non-independence assumed to exist in network data, because regression-based permutation tests still assume exchangeability of residuals. The same theoretical condition also applies to the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP), a permutation-based method often used for conducting dyadic regression.We highlight that node-label permutations produce the same p-values as equivalent parametric regression models, but that in the presence of confounds, parametric regression models produce more accurate effect size estimates. We also note that QAP only controls for a specific type of non-independence between edges that are connected to the same nodes, and that appropriate parametric regression models are also able to account for this type of non-independence.Based on this, we advocate the retirement of permutation tests for regression analyses, in favour of well-specified parametric models. Moving away from permutation-based methods will reduce over-reliance on p-values, generate more reliable estimates of effect sizes, and facilitate the adoption of more powerful types of statistical analysis.",1755,61,465,21.0

Evidence suggests that memory can also be impaired by either chronic stress or microbiota imbalance. However, it remains to be established whether these could be a part of an integrated loop model and be responsible for memory impairments. To shed light on this, we used a two-pronged approach in Japanese quail: first stress-induced alterations in gut microbiota were characterized, then we tested whether this altered microbiota could affect brain and memory function when transferred to a germ-free host. The cecal microbiota of chronically stressed quails was found to be significantly different from that of unstressed individuals with lower α and β diversities and increased Bacteroidetes abundance largely represented by the Alistipes genus, a well-known stress target in rodents and humans. The transfer of this altered microbiota into germ-free quails decreased their spatial and cue-based memory abilities as previously demonstrated in the stressed donors. The recipients also displayed increased anxiety-like behavior, reduced basal plasma corticosterone levels and differential gene expression in the brain. Furthermore, cecal microbiota transfer from a chronically stressed individual was sufficient to mimic the adverse impact of chronic stress on memory in recipient hosts and this action may be related to the Alistipes genus. Our results provide evidence of a feed-forward loop system linking the microbiota-gut-brain axis to stress and memory function and suggest that maintaining a healthy microbiota could help alleviate memory impairments linked to chronic stress.",1227,40,131,47.0

Pups were sampled from two nearby breeding colonies of contrasting density during two subsequent years, and a two-state hidden Markov model was used to identify modalities in their movement behaviour, specifically ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ states. We found that movement was typified by central place exploration, with active movement away from and subsequent return to a location of inactivity. The probability of such directed exploration was unaffected by several factors known to influence marine mammal movement including sex, body condition, and temperature. Compared to pups born at the high-density colony, pups at low-density were more active, increased their activity with age, and transitioned earlier into the tussock grass, which offers protection from predators and extreme weather.

Individuals from each species underwent three weeks of simultaneous testing to investigate the hypothesis that comfort level of the sleep-site influences sleep.

As dominance interactions are costly, individuals should be strategic in who they interact with. One hypothesis is that individuals should direct costly interactions towards those closest in rank, as they have most to gain—in terms of attaining or maintaining dominance—from winning such interactions. Here, we develop a novel analytical framework to test whether interactions are directed strategically in relation to rank differences, and use these to compare strategies across types of interactions that vary in cost. We show that male vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), a gregarious species with steep dominance hierarchies, strategically direct costly interactions towards males occupying ranks immediately below themselves in their group’s hierarchy. In contrast, low-cost interactions are not directed towards closest competitors, but towards group members slightly further down the hierarchy. We then show that, as a result of the difference in strategic use of high- and low-cost interactions towards closest competitors, individuals disproportionately use highest-cost interactions—such as chases—towards males found one to three ranks below them. Our results support the hypothesis that the costs associated with different interaction types can determine their expression in social groups.",1390,34,187,24.0

Here, we investigated the circadian clock of wild-caught threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) at the behavioural and molecular levels. While their behaviour, ecology, and evolution are well studied, information on their circadian rhythms are scarce. We quantified the daily locomotor activity rhythm under a light-dark cycle (LD) and under constant darkness (DD). Under LD, all fish exhibited significant daily rhythmicity, while under DD, only 18% of individuals remained rhythmic. This interindividual variation suggests that the circadian clock controls activity only in certain individuals. Moreover, under LD, some fish were almost exclusively nocturnal, while others were active around the clock. Furthermore, the most nocturnal fish were also the least active. These results suggest that light masks activity more strongly in some individuals than others. Finally, we quantified the expression of five clock genes in the brain of sticklebacks under DD using qPCR. We did not detect circadian rhythmicity, which could either indicate that the clock molecular oscillator is highly light-dependent, or that there was an oscillation but that we were unable to detect it. Overall, our study suggests that a strong circadian control on behavioural rhythms may not necessarily be advantageous in a natural population of sticklebacks and that the daily phase of activity varies greatly between individuals because of a differential masking effect of light.Summary statement We found that in wild-caught threespine sticklebacks, the circadian clock does not control locomotor activity in most, but not all, individuals.

Here, we hypothesized that the degree to which a juvenile songbird learns a song depends on the degree to which it finds that song rewarding to hear during vocal development. We tested this hypothesis by measuring song preferences in young birds during song learning and then analyzing their adult songs. Song preferences were measured in an operant key-pressing assay. Juvenile male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) had access to two keys, each of which was associated with a higher likelihood of playing the song of their father or that of another familiar adult (“neighbor”). To minimize the effects of exposure on learning, we implemented a reinforcement schedule that allowed us to detect preferences while balancing exposure to each song. On average, the juveniles significantly preferred the father’s song early during song learning, before they were themselves singing. At around post-hatch day 60, their preference shifted to the neighbor’s song. At the end of the song learning period, we recorded the juveniles’ songs and compared them to the father’s and the neighbor’s song. All of the birds copied father’s song. The accuracy with which the father’s song was imitated was positively correlated with the peak strength of the preference for the father’s song during the sensitive period.

Because CSD can be elicited in the absence of males by the presentation of recorded song, CSD production enables investigations into the effects of underlying signal features and behavioral state on female mating preferences. Using computer vision to quantify CSD trajectory in female brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), we show that both song quality and a female’s internal state predict CSD production, as well as the onset latency and duration of the display. We also show that CSD can be produced in a graded fashion based on both signal strength and internal state.

In Exp. 3, the effect of the co-blockade of M1 and NMDA receptors was replicated. Moreover, sole blockade of M1 receptors induced the same effect as M1 and NMDA blockade.

A theoretical understanding of the cognitive mechanisms of categorization requires a careful consideration of the employed stimulus material. Optimally, stimuli should not consist of real-world objects that might be associated with prior experience. The number of exemplars should be theoretically infinite and easy to produce. In addition, the experimenter should have the freedom to produce 2D- and 3D-versions of the stimuli and, finally, the stimulus set should provide the opportunity to identify the diagnostic elements that the animals use. To this end, we used the approach of “virtual phylogenesis” of “digital embryos” to produce two stimulus sets of objects that meet these criteria. In our experiment pigeons learned to categorize these stimuli in a forced-choice procedure. In addition, we used peck tracking to identify where on the stimulus the animals pecked to signal their choice. Pigeons learned the task and transferred successfully to novel exemplars. Using a k-nearest neighbor classifier, we were able to predict the presented stimulus class based on pecking location indicating that pecks are related to features of interest. We further identified potential strategies of the pigeons through this approach, namely that they were either learning one or two categories to discriminate between stimulus classes. These strategies remained stable during category transfer, but differed between individuals indicating that categorization learning is not limited to a single learning strategy.",711,38,55,32.0

The phenomenon itself is narrowly heritably canalized, but its content, the representation of the parental object, reflects the circumstances of the newborn. Imprinting has recently been shown to be even more subtle and complex than previously envisaged, since ducklings and chicks are now known to select and represent for later generalization  conceptual properties of the objects they perceive as neonates, including movement pattern, heterogeneity, and inter-component relationships of same or different. Here we investigate whether day-old Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) imprint on the temporal separation between duos of brief acoustic stimuli, and whether they generalize such timing information to novel sound types. Subjects did discriminate temporal structure when imprinted and tested on natural duck calls, but not when using white noise for imprinting or testing. Our data confirm that imprinting includes the establishment of neural representations of both primary percepts and  properties of candidate objects, meshing together genetically transmitted prior knowledge with selected perceptual input.",772,78,115,17.0

Given the ubiquity of SAT across species, extensive research has been devoted to understanding the computational mechanisms allowing its regulation at different timescales, including from one context to another, and from one decision to another. However, animals must frequently change their SAT on even shorter timescales – i.e., over the course of an ongoing decision – and little is known about the mechanisms that allow such rapid adaptations. The present study aimed at addressing this issue. Human subjects performed a decision task with changing evidence. In this task, subjects received rewards for correct answers but incurred penalties for mistakes. An increase or a decrease in penalty occurring halfway through the trial promoted rapid SAT shifts, favoring speeded decisions either in the early or in the late stage of the trial. Importantly, these shifts were associated with stage-specific adjustments in the accuracy criterion exploited for committing to a choice. Those subjects who decreased the most their accuracy criterion at a given decision stage exhibited the highest gain in speed, but also the highest cost in terms of performance accuracy at that time. Altogether, the current findings offer a unique extension of previous work, by suggesting that dynamic changes in accuracy criterion allow the regulation of the SAT within the timescale of a single decision.New and noteworthy Extensive research has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms allowing the regulation of the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) from one context to another and from one decision to another.

To do so, the discoid cockroach often pushes its wings against the ground to begin a somersault which rarely succeeds. As it repeatedly attempts this, the animal probabilistically rolls to the side to self- right. During winged self-righting, the animal flails its legs vigorously. Here, we studied whether wing opening and leg flailing together facilitate strenuous ground self-righting. Adding mass to increase hind leg flailing kinetic energy increased the animal’s self-righting probability. We then developed a robot with similar strenuous self-righting behavior and used it as a physical model for systematic experiments. The robot’s self-righting probability increased with wing opening and leg flailing amplitudes. A potential energy landscape model revealed that, although wing opening did not generate sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the high pitch potential energy barrier to somersault, it reduced the barrier for rolling, facilitating the small kinetic energy from leg flailing to probabilistically overcome it to self-right. The model also revealed that the stereotyped body motion during self-righting emerged from physical interaction of the body and appendages with the ground. Our work demonstrated the usefulness of potential energy landscape for modeling self-righting transitions.Impact statement Animals can, and robots should, use different types of appendages together to propel and perturb themselves to self-right when overturned, a strenuous yet crucial locomotor task.",618,103,163,53.0

Previous work has suggested that guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) may differ in the relative importance they place on these two senses in social interactions. In this study, we directly examined this issue by experimentally contrasting olfactory and visual information in social situations. In the first experiment, we found that guppies spent more time where conspecifics were visible than where they could smell them. On the contrary, zebrafish spent significantly more time in an empty compartment containing smell of conspecifics than in a compartment in which they only saw them. The difference was not large, suggesting that both species integrate various types of information to locate a nearby shoal. In two subsequent experiments, we studied the role of vision and smell in the discrimination of the quality of the social group, namely the number and the familiarity of its members. Zebrafish and guppies were confirmed to rely on different senses to estimate the size of a social group, whereas they did not differ in the discrimination of familiar and non-familiar conspecifics which appears to be based equally on the two senses. Similarly to what happens in other vertebrate clades, we suggest that, among teleosts, there are large differences in the relative importance of the different senses in the perception of the external world.",1122,52,124,27.0

One perspective involves increasing the complexity of associative learning, from conditioning to learning sequences of events (‘chaining’) to representing various cue combinations as ‘chunks’. Here we develop a weighted-graph model to study the conditions for the evolution of chunking ability, based on the ecology of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. Cleaners must learn to serve visitor clients before resident clients, because a visitor leaves if not attended while a resident waits for service. This challenge has been captured in various versions of the ephemeral-reward task, which has been proven difficult for a range of cognitively capable species. We show that chaining is the minimal requirement for solving the laboratory task, that involves repeated simultaneous exposure to an ephemeral and permanent food source. Adding ephemeral-ephemeral and permanent-permanent combinations, as cleaners face in the wild, requires individuals to have chunking abilities to solve the task. Importantly, chunking parameters need to be calibrated to ecological conditions in order to produce adaptive decisions. Thus, it is the fine tuning of this ability which may be the major target of selection during the evolution of advanced associative learning.",1169,55,98,31.0

This study used non-invasive mouse models to study biochemical, biomechanical and pain-related behavior changes induced in mice following repetitive mechanical knee loading. Mouse models were used to reflect the effects of the early stages of PTOA in humans.Methods Forty-eight twelve week old male mice were obtained for three groups: normal control without mechanical loading, trauma (24 hours after loading), and PTOA (early OA) groups. For the non-invasive PTOA mouse model, cyclic comprehensive loading (9 N) was applied on the left knee joint of each mouse. Biochemical and molecular changes induced by mechanical loading were analyzed after loading was completed. Blood and cartilage were collected and further examined using gene expression analysis. Grading of the tissue sections was completed using the osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) scale. Biomechanical features of mechanically loaded knee joints were determined after 24 hours (Trauma) and three weeks (PTOA) post-mechanical loading sessions to examine the development of PTOA, respectively.Results The loaded left knee joint showed a greater ROS/RNS signal than the right knee that was not loaded. There was an increase in cartilage damage and MMP activity in the affected knee as the intensity of MabCII680 and MMP750 signal increased in the mechanical loaded joints as compared to unloaded control knee joints. There was also an increase in the difference of viscoelastic energy dissipation ability (tan δ) in PTOA. The OA score increased significantly in mechanically loaded knee joints.Conclusion This study showed that biomechanical, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics of the murine PTOA groups are significantly different from the control group.

X-ray and HE staining were conducted on the fractured femur to evaluate the pathological state. Immunohistochemical assay was used to detect the expression level of Beclin-1 and immunofluorescence assay was used to measure the expression level of LC3 in the fractured femurs. Western blot was utilized to determine the expression level of PI3K, p-AKT1, AKT1, p-mTOR, mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p70S6K.Results The ALP activity and expression of RunX2 in fractured osteoblasts were significantly suppressed by 3-methyladenine and elevated by rapamycin, 60, and 80 μM β-ecdysterone. The apoptotic state of fractured osteoblasts was enhanced by 3-methyladenine and alleviated by rapamycin, 60, and 80 μM β-ecdysterone.

Choosiness is defined as the individual effort to invest energy and time to assess potential mates. In explosive breeding anurans, high intrasexual competition between males leads to a sexual coercion ruled mating system, where males could have evolved preferences for specific female traits. In the current study, we tested male mating preference in the explosive breeding European Common Frog without intrasexual competition. We hypothesized that males show preferences towards larger female body size in the absence of male competition. We conducted mate choice experiments, placing a male and two differently sized females in a box and recorded their mating behavior. Males did not show any preference considering female body size, neither in the attempt to grab a female nor during the formation of pairs. We witnessed a high failure rate of male mating attempts, which might make the evolution of mate choice too costly. However, small males are faster in attempting females, which could be an alternative strategy to get access to females, because their larger competitors have an advantage during scramble competition. Nonetheless, in successfully formed pairs, the females were on average larger than the males, an observation which deviated from our null-model where pairs should be of similar size if mating would be random. This indicates that selection takes place, independent from male mating preference or scramble competition.",1067,39,95,20.0

In computational models of this process we reveal the occurrence of spontaneous and abrupt “critical” transitions (associated with specific geometrical relationships) whereby organisms spontaneously switch from averaging vectorial information among, to suddenly excluding one, among the remaining options. This bifurcation process repeats until only one option---the one ultimately selected---remains. Thus we predict that the brain repeatedly breaks multi-choice decisions into a series of binary decisions in space-time. Experiments with fruit flies, desert locusts, and larval zebrafish reveal that they exhibit these same bifurcations, demonstrating that across taxa and ecological context, we show that there exist fundamental geometric principles that are essential to explain how, and why, animals move the way they do.",2348,147,728,23.0

To capture neurogenomic events underlying the dramatic behavioral transition toward parental caring behaviors, we analyzed brain gene expression and chromatin profiles of virgin female mice co-housed with mothers during pregnancy and after birth. After an initial display of antagonistic behaviors and a surge of defense-related gene expression, we observed a dramatic shift in the chromatin landscape specifically in amygdala, accompanied by a dampening of the defense-related genes. This shift coincided with the emergence of behaviors and gene expression classically associated with maternal care. The results reveal the outlines of a neurogenomic program associated with this dramatic behavioral switch, and suggest molecular networks that may be relevant to human postpartum mental health.",1177,90,170,35.0

We previously found that when rats need to retrieve particular memories to guide exploration, it reduces later retention of other memories encoded in that environment. As with humans, this retrieval-induced forgetting relies on prefrontal control processes. The dopaminergic input to the prefrontal cortex is important for executive functions and cognitive flexibility. We found that, in a similar way, prefrontal dopamine signaling through D1 receptors is required for retrieval-induced forgetting in rats. Blockade of medial prefrontal cortex D1 receptors as animals encountered a familiar object impaired forgetting of the memory of a competing object in a subsequent long-term memory test. Inactivation of the ventral tegmental area produced the same pattern of behavior, a pattern that could be reversed by concomitant activation of prefrontal D1 receptors. We observed a bidirectional modulation of retrieval-induced forgetting by agonists and antagonists of D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings establish the essential role of prefrontal dopamine in the active forgetting of competing memories, contributing to the shaping of retention in response to an organisms’ behavioral goals.",1026,86,241,27.0

Spatial positions can be quantified in numerous ways, but there are no direct comparisons of different spatial measures in predicting the risk of being targeted by real predators. Here we assess these spatial measures in groups of stationary and moving virtual prey being attacked by three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In stationary groups, the limited domain of danger best predicted the likelihood of attack. In moving groups, the number of near neighbours was the best predictor but only over a limited range of distances within which other prey were counted. Otherwise, measures of proximity to the group’s edge outperformed measures of local crowding in moving groups. There was no evidence that predators preferentially attacked the front or back of the moving groups. Domains of danger without any limit, as originally used in the selfish herd model, were also a poor predictor of risk.

We tested whether endangered ‘alalā (Corvus hawaiiensis), which are extinct in nature, have retained their natural responses to survival-relevant vocal calls. We conducted our studies on breeding populations derived from a small number of founding ‘alalā maintained in human care since their extinction in the wild in 2002. We presented pairs of ‘alalā with alarm, territorial intrusion, and two types of control playback calls (a non-threatening territorial maintenance call and a novel heterospecific call). ‘Alalā were significantly more likely to approach the speaker following alarm call playback than other call types, and were more likely to respond to territorial intrusion calls with the same aggressive territorial calls. Males were more likely to make these aggressive calls than females, mirroring their roles in territory defense. We also found individual consistency in the level of vocal behavior response across all call types, indicating that some individuals are more vocal than others. These results are encouraging, showing that ‘alalā exhibit relevant, species-specific behaviors despite generations under human care.

Conventional power analyses assume complete information, but the stochastic nature of behavioural sampling can mean that true and estimated networks are poorly correlated. Power analyses do not currently take the effect of sampling into account. This could lead to inaccurate estimates of statistical power, potentially yielding misleading results.Here we develop a method for computing network correlation: the correlation between an estimated social network and its true network, using a Gamma-Poisson model of interaction rates. We use simulations to assess how the level of network correlation affects the power of nodal regression analyses. We also develop a generic method of power analysis applicable to any statistical test, based on the concept of diminishing returns.We demonstrate that our network correlation estimator is both accurate and moderately robust to its assumptions being broken. We show that social differentiation, mean interaction rate, and the harmonic mean of sampling times positively impacts the strength of network correlation. We also show that the required level of network correlation to achieve a given power level depends on many factors, but that 80% network correlation usually corresponds to around 80% power for nodal regression in ideal circumstances.We provide guidelines for using our network correlation estimator to verify the accuracy of interaction networks, and to conduct power analysis.

We examined variation in lumpfish personalities according to the five-factor personality model that takes into account differences in activity, anxiety (shelter use, thigmotaxis), aggression, sociality, and boldness (neophobia). We then quantified how variation in lumpfish personalities influenced interactions with naïve Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), without the confounding effects of variation in sea-lice loads. Variation in activity, sociality, aggression and neophobia, but not in anxiety, was repeatable, which is consistent with a heritable basis. Neophilic, non-aggressive lumpfish spent more time inspecting salmon than neophobic and aggressive individuals, but salmon fled in the presence of the most active and social individuals, suggesting there may be an optimal cleaner fish personality amenable to artificial selection.

We tracked electrocommunication signals, in particular “rises”, and agonistic behaviors of the gymnotiform electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in staged competition experiments. A larger body size relative to the opponent was the sole significant predictor for winners. Sex and the frequency of the continuously emitted electric field were only mildly influencing competition outcome. In males, correlations of body-size and winning were stronger than in females and, especially when losing against females, communication and agonistic interactions were enhanced, hinting towards males being more motivated to compete. Fish that lost competitions emitted the majority of rises in dependence on the competitors’ relative size and sex. The emission of rises was costly since it provoked ritualized biting or chasing behaviors by the other fish. Despite winners being accurately predictable based on rise numbers already after the initial 25 minutes, losers continued to emit rises.

For example, patterns of mating can impact social structure, dispersal, effective population size and inbreeding. However, few species have been studied in sufficient detail to elucidate mating system plasticity and its dependence on ecological and demographic factors. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) have long been regarded as a textbook example of a polygynous mating system, with dominant ‘beachmaster’ males controlling harems of up to several hundred females. However, behavioural and genetic studies have uncovered appreciable geographic variation in the strength of polygyny among elephant seal populations. We therefore used molecular parentage analysis to investigate patterns of parentage in a small satellite colony of elephant seals at the South Shetland Islands. We hypothesised that dominant males would be able to successfully monopolise the relatively small numbers of females present in the colony, leading to relatively high levels of polygyny. A total of 424 individuals (comprising 33 adult males, 101 adult females and 290 pups) sampled over eight years were genotyped at 20 microsatellites and reproductive success was analysed by genetically assigning parents. Paternity could only be assigned to 31 out of 290 pups (10.7%), despite our panel of genetic markers being highly informative and the genotyping error rate being very low. The strength of inferred polygyny was weak in comparison to previous genetic studies of the same species, with the most successful male fathering only seven pups over the entire course of the study. Our results show that, even in a species long regarded as a model for extreme polygyny, male reproductive skew can vary substantially among populations.",836,38,81,27.0

This construct is known as anticipatory negative contrast (ANC) and can help elucidate the processes that underlie binge-like behavior as well as self-control in rodent motivation models. In the current investigation we aimed to shed light on the ability of distinct predictors of a preferred food choice to generate contrast effects and the motivational processes that underlie this behavior. Using a novel set of rewarding solutions, we directly compared contextual and gustatory ANC predictors in both food restricted and free-fed Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results indicate that, despite being food restricted, rats are selective in their eating behavior and show strong contextually-driven ANC and do so after fewer training sessions than free-fed animals. These differences mirrored changes in palatability for the less preferred solution across the different sessions as measured by lick microstructure analysis. Moreover, in contrast to previous research, gustatory cues in both food restricted and free-fed rats were sufficient for ANC to develop although this flavor-driven ANC did not relate to a corresponding change in lick patterning. These differences in the lick microstructure between context- and flavor-driven ANC indicate that the motivational processes underlying ANC generated by the two predictor types are distinct.",997,38,101,22.0

We show that, without any intervention, their statistics may be directly estimated through a model-free analysis of inter-response times – the silent intervals between recalls. A delay attributable to unreported recalls emerges in three situations: if the final item was already recalled (“silent recency effect”); if the item that, within the list, follows the latest recalled item was already recalled (“silent contiguity effect”); and in sequential recalls within highly performing trials (“sequential slowdown”). We then turn to reproducing all these effects by a minimal model where the discarding of memories (“bouncing”) occurs either if they are repetitious or, in strategically organized trials, if they are not sequential.

Rapid growth may also limit the performance of motivated behaviors, whereas the provision of enrichment may increase these behaviors and general activity. This study aimed to evaluate the inactivity, behavior, and enrichment use of 2 fast- (CONV) and 12 slower-growing broiler strains [categorized as fastest (FAST), moderate (MOD) and slowest slow (SLOW), based on their growth rates]. To evaluate inactivity, one male and one female from 153 pens were outfitted with omni-directional accelerometers from day 21 until processing (14–24 birds/strain from 8-12 pens/strain). Additionally, to supplement inactivity data, five-minute continuous behavioral observations of four focal birds per pen (2 males, 2 females) were conducted on days 26, 42, and 56 (72–148 observations of 8–12 pens/strain) to quantify the duration and frequency of various behaviors; at the same time, 5–11 instantaneous scan samples were also performed for pen-based enrichment use. Inactivity peaked at 78-80% of the day for all strains; however, those with slower growth rates reached these levels at older ages. Compared to slower-growing strains at the same age, faster-growing strains were more inactive, spent more time sitting and feeding, spent less time standing and walking, and used enrichments less; these differences mostly occurred at younger ages. Generally, at the same age, strains with similar growth rates (within the same category) behaved similarly, with only a few exceptions. Results suggest that not all strains identified as ‘slow-growing’ broilers behave differently from fast-growing broilers, nor do they all behave similarly to each other. As such, results suggest that improved broiler welfare, particularly with respect to reduced inactivity, the performance of a wider range of normal, motivated behaviors, and/or increased enrichment use, is related to the broiler strain’s specific growth rate.",953,45,161,42.0

Zipf’s law of brevity describes a negative relationship between behavioural length and frequency of behaviour. Menzerath’s law defines a negative correlation between the number of behaviours in a sequence and average length of the behaviour composing it. Both laws have been linked with the information-theoretic principle of compression, which tends to minimise code length. We investigate the presence of these two laws in the repertoire of chimpanzee sexual solicitation gestures. We find that chimpanzee solicitation gestures do not follow either Zipf’s law of brevity or Menzerath’s law consistently. For the second time in ape gestural communication, evidence supporting Zipf’s law of brevity was absent, and, here, the presence of Menzerath’s law appears individually driven. Ape gesture does not appear to manifest a principle of compression or pressure for efficiency that has been previously proposed to be universal. Importantly, the same signals were shown to adhere to these laws when used in a different behavioural context; highlighting that signallers consider signalling efficiency broadly, and diverse factors play important roles in shaping investment in signal production.",836,39,117,32.0

We modify a model of human tool evolution to accommodate cultural evolution of birdsong: each song learner chooses the most skilled available tutor to emulate, and each is more likely to produce an inferior copy than a superior one. Similarly to human tool evolution, we show that larger populations foster improvements in song over time, even when learners restrict their pool of tutors to a subset of individuals. We also demonstrate that songs could be simplified instead of lost after population bottlenecks if lower-quality traits are easier to imitate than higher-quality ones. We show that these processes could plausibly generate empirically observed patterns of song evolution, and we make predictions about the types of song elements most likely to be lost when populations shrink. More broadly, we aim to connect the modeling approaches used in human and non-human systems, moving toward a cohesive theoretical framework that accounts for both cognitive and demographic processes.",1254,115,170,20.0

Yet, in the context of behavioral neuroscience and pharmacological studies, social context of adult animals is often ignored. When social context has been studied in adult monkeys, such studies have typically focused on welfare-related issues, as social isolation often leads to the development of abnormal behavior, rather than the impact on outcomes in behavioral neuroscience studies. Variation in social housing conditions for adult animals could have an impact on affective responding and may have significant implications for the interpretation of data from biopsychiatry and behavioral neuroscience studies. We evaluated the affective reactivity of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) maintained in one of four housing conditions (individually-housed, grate-paired, intermittently-paired, and continuously-paired) using two classic threat processing tasks—a test of responsivity to objects and the Human Intruder Test. Individually-housed monkeys exhibited consistently blunted sensitivity to ostensibly threatening stimuli as compared to socially-housed monkeys. Within the three socially-housed conditions, intermittently- and continuously-paired monkeys behaved similarly to each other and grate-paired monkeys exhibited relatively enhanced sensitivity to threatening stimuli. These findings suggest that the adult housing conditions of monkeys can robustly modulate affective responding in a way that may be consistent with behavioral phenotypes observed in human psychiatric conditions. Results are considered in the context of the broad behavioral and psychiatric neuroscience literatures, which have historically used individually-housed animals, pointing to the potential need to reconsider inferences drawn from those studies.",1095,47,134,30.0

In this study, we further this work by examining temperature inside the honey bee colony. By placing temperature and light data loggers at different locations inside the colony we measured temperature at various locations within the colony. We observed significant oscillations of temperature inside the hive, that show seasonal patterns. We then simulated the observed temperature oscillations in the laboratory and found that using the temperature cycle as a Zeitgeber, foragers present large individual differences in the phase of locomotor rhythms with respect to temperature. Moreover, foragers successfully synchronize their locomotor rhythms to these simulated temperature cycles. Advancing the cycle by six hours, resulted in changes in the phase of activity in some foragers in the assay. The results shown in this study highlight the importance of temperature as a potential Zeitgeber in the field.

The present study attempts a first systematic evaluation of available experimental data from non-human animals, which is an essential basis for quantifying biological and non-biological factors (e.g. socio-ecology versus experimental design) affecting performance in delay of gratification tasks. Data were sourced from 52 separate studies, and a comprehensive overview of the available literature on delay of gratification in non-human animals is presented. We present data from 21 species, spanning across eight taxonomic order, with 1–9 species tested per taxonomic group. We highlight variation in experimental paradigms used to study delay of gratification abilities in non-human animals, both with regard to reward type or experimental setup, and discuss the implications for comparative analyses. We conclude that, at present, cross-species comparisons of delay of gratification abilities are hindered by a lack of consistency in experimental designs and low number of species tested across taxonomic orders.

The repurposing of FDA-approved compounds is an effective and expedited means of screening pharmacotherapies for AUD. Here, we demonstrate that apremilast, a phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor that is FDA approved for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, reduces binge-like alcohol intake and behavioral measures of motivation in unique, preclinical genetic risk models for drinking to intoxication and reduces excessive alcohol drinking in models of stress-facilitated drinking and alcohol dependence. In a double blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study in non-treatment seeking individuals with AUD, apremilast significantly reduced the number of drinks per day. Lastly, using site-directed drug infusions and electrophysiology we determined that apremilast may act by increasing neural activity in the nucleus accumbens, an important alcohol-related brain region, to reduce alcohol intake in mice.

We compared the DNA variation of one of the predator-avoidance behaviors, the recently extensively studied “death-feigning behavior,” between the long strain bred for feigning death for a long time and the short strain bred for feigning death for a short time. To clarify how the difference in DNA sequences between the long and short strains corresponds to the physiological characteristics of the death-feigning duration at the transcriptome level, we performed comprehensive and comparative analyses of gene variants in Tribolium castaneum strains using DNA-re-sequence. The duration of death feigning involves many gene pathways, including caffeine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, longevity regulating pathways, and circadian rhythm. Artificial selection based on the duration of death feigning results in the preservation of variants of genes in these pathways in the long strain. When an animal wake up from a near-death experience is closely related to its success in avoiding predation.

In the present work, we investigated whether monkeys could improve their joint-action performance, under special visuomotor conditions. The behavior of 5 monkeys was analyzed in isometric center-out tasks, requiring hand force application in different directions, either individually or together with a partner. Manipulating the presence or absence of a pre-instruction about the future action condition (SOLO or TOGETHER), allowed us to investigate on the existence of a “we-representation” in macaque monkeys. We found that pre-cueing the future action context increased the chances of dyadic success, also thanks to the emergence of an optimal kinematic setting, that ultimately facilitates inter-individual motor coordination.

This study integrates 1) a longitudinal behavioural assessment with 2) a novel joint hierarchical Bayesian mixture model that accounts for individual variation, missing data and measurement error to predict behaviour post-adoption. We analysed shelter observations (&gt; 28,000 records) and post-adoption reports (from telephone surveys) on the behaviour of 241 dogs across eight contexts. Dog behaviour at the shelter correlated positively with behaviour post-adoption within contexts (r = 0.38; 95% highest density interval: [0.20, 0.55]), and behavioural repeatability was approximately 20% higher post-adoption than at the shelter for behaviour within contexts. Although measurement error was higher post-adoption than at the shelter, we found few differences in individual-level, latent probabilities of different behaviours post-adoption versus at the shelter. This good predictive ability was aided by accurate representation of uncertainty in individual-level predictions.

We programmed interactive robot-controlled prey to flee from an approaching blue acara predator (Andinoacara pulcher), allowing us to manipulate the predictability of the prey’s initial escape direction. When repeatedly exposed to predictable prey, the predators adjusted their behaviour before the prey even began to escape: prey programmed to escape directly away were approached more rapidly than prey escaping at an acute angle. These faster approach speeds compensated for a longer time needed to capture such prey during the subsequent pursuit phase, and predators showed greater acceleration when pursuing unpredictable prey. Collectively, these behaviours resulted in the prey’s predictability having no net effect on the time to capture prey.

The synaptic signaling pathways that mediate the restorative benefits of sleep are not fully understood, particularly in the context of development. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) including 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), are bioactive lipids that activate cannabinoid receptor, CB1, to regulate synaptic transmission and mediate cognitive functions and many behaviors, including sleep. We used targeted mass spectrometry to measure changes in forebrain synaptic eCBs during the sleep/wake cycle in developing and adult mice. We find that eCBs are downregulated in response to acute sleep deprivation in juvenile mice, while in young adults eCBs are upregulated during the sleep phase in a circadian manner. Next we manipulated the eCB system using selective pharmacology and measured the effects on sleep behavior in developing and adult mice of both sexes using a non-invasive piezoelectric home-cage recording apparatus. Enhancement of eCB signaling through inhibition of 2-AG or AEA degradation, increased dark phase sleep amount and bout length in developing and adult males, but not in females. Inhibition of CB1 by injection of the antagonist AM251 reduced sleep time and caused sleep fragmentation in developing and adult males and females. Our data suggest that males are more sensitive to the sleep promoting effects of enhanced eCBs but that tonic eCB signaling supports sleep behavior through multiple stages of development in both sexes.

This fact has lead neural networks researchers to test same-different classification on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which has resulted in a controversy regarding whether this skill is within the capacity of these models. However, most tests of same-different classification rely on testing on images that come from the same pixel-level distribution as the testing images, yielding the results inconclusive. In this study we tested relational same-different reasoning DCNNs. In a series of simulations we show that DCNNs are capable of visual same-different classification, but only when the test images are similar to the training images at the pixel-level. In contrast, even when there are only subtle differences between the testing and training images, the performance of DCNNs could drop to chance levels. This is true even when DCNNs’ training regime included a wide distribution of images or when they were trained in a multi-task setup in which training included an additional relational task with test images from the same pixel-level distribution.",2606,473,817,6.0

The virtual environment imposes a limited field of view, creating a natural trade-off between allocating visual attention towards individual search or to look towards peers for social imitation. By analyzing foraging patterns, social interactions (visual and spatial), and social influence, we shine new light on how groups collectively adapt to the fluctuating demands of the environment through specialization and selective imitation, rather than homogeneity and indiscriminate copying of others.",1171,70,274,7.0

We propose that starved L1s produce and respond chemotactically to two labile diffusible chemical signals, a short-range attractant and a longer range repellent. This model takes the mathematical form of three coupled partial differential equations, one that describes the movement of the worms and one for each of the chemical signals. Numerical solution of these equations produced a pattern of aggregates that resembled that of worm aggregates observed in experiments. We also describe the identification of a sensory receptor gene, srh–2, whose expression is induced under conditions that promote L1 aggregation. Worms whose srh–2 gene has been knocked out form irregularly shaped aggregates. Our model suggests this phenotype may be explained by the mutant worms slowing their movement more quickly than the wild type.Author summary Among the most complex of animal behaviors are collective behaviors, in which animals interact with each other so as to produce large-scale organization. Starved first-stage larvae of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit such a behavior: they come together to form aggregates of several hundred worms. How and why they do this are unknown. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model of starved L1 aggregation. This model reproduced the main features of the behavior.",518,178,107,47.0

In the context of foraging, searching for food sources is performed by behavioral specialized foragers, the scouts. When the scouts have found a new food source, they recruit other foragers (recruits). These recruits never search for a new food source on their own. However, when the food source is experimentally removed, they start searching for that food source. Our study provides a detailed description of this solitary search behavior and the variation of this behavior among individual foragers. Furthermore, mass spectrometric measurement showed that the initiation and performance of this solitary search behavior is associated with changes in glutamate, GABA, histamine, aspartate and the catecholaminergic system in the optic lobes and central brain area. These findings strikingly correspond with the results of an earlier study that showed that scouts and recruits differ in the expression of glutamate and GABA receptors. Together, the results of both studies provide first clear support for the hypothesis that behavioral specialization in honey bees is based on adjusting modulatory systems involved in solitary behavior to increase the probability or frequency of that behavior.",1977,165,301,29.0

Amongst these techniques, DeepLabCut, a python-based tracking toolbox using transfer learning with deep neural networks, offers the possibility to track different body parts with unprecedented accuracy. Exploiting the potentialities of DeepLabCut, we developed ‘Visual Field Analysis’, an additional open-source application for extracting eye-use data. To our knowledge, this is the first application that can automatically quantify left-right preferences in eye use. Here we test the performance of our application in measuring preferential eye-use in young domestic chicks.

However, initial trial-and-error features that ultimately give rise to skilled, stereotypic movements, and the underlying neurobiological basis of flexibility in learning, to stereotypic movement in adult animals are still unclear. Knowledge obtained from addressing these questions is crucial to improve quality of life in patients affected by movement disorders.We sought to determine if known kinematic parameters of skilled movement in humans could predict learning of motor efficiency in mice during the single pellet reaching and grasping assay. Mice were food restricted to increase motivation to reach for a high reward food pellet. Their attempts to retrieve the pellet were recorded for 10 minutes a day for continuous 4 days. Individual successful and failed reaches for each mouse were manually tracked using Tracker Motion Analysis Software to extract time series data and kinematic features. We found the number of peaks and time to maximum velocity were strong predictors of individual variation in failure and success, respectively. Overall, our approach validates the use of select kinematic features to describe fine motor skill acquisition in mice and establishes peaks and time to maximum velocity as predictive measure of natural variation in motion efficiency in mice.

The gaze could avert or remain direct, while the emotion changed to fearful or happy. N200 field potential peak latencies indicated that face processing begins in inferior occipital cortex and proceeds anteroventrally to fusiform and inferior temporal cortices, in parallel. The superior temporal sulcus responded preferentially to gaze changes with augmented field potential amplitudes for averted versus direct gaze, and large effect sizes relative to other network regions. An overlap analysis of posterior white matter tractography endpoints (from 1066 healthy brains) relative to active intracerebral electrodes in the 11 patients showed likely involvement of both dorsal and ventral posterior white matter pathways.

In this study, we used a mouse model of AAE in which adolescent mice reach high blood alcohol concentration after voluntary binge-drinking. In order to assess short- and long-term consequences of AAE, a battery of behavioral tests was performed during late adolescence and during adulthood. We showed that AAE had no short-term effect on young mice behavior but rather increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, as well as alcohol consumption during adulthood. Moreover, alcohol binge-drinking during adolescence dramatically decreased recognition memory performances and behavioral flexibility in both adult males and females. Furthermore, we showed that voluntary consumption of alcohol during adolescence did not trigger any major activation of the innate immune system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Rodents provide a tractable model for elucidating disease mechanisms and interventions, however, studying gait and whole body posture in rodent models requires specialized methods and remains challenging. Here, we develop a simple assay that allows adoption of the commonly used open field apparatus for gait and whole body posture analysis. We leverage modern neural networks to  a mouse into keypoints and extract gait and whole body coordination metrics of the animal. Gait-level analysis allows us to detect every step of the animal’s movement and provides high resolution information about the animal’s behavior. We quantitate gait and whole body posture with high precision and accuracy across 62 highly visually diverse strains of mice. We apply our approach to characterize four genetic mutants with known gait deficits. In extended analysis, we demonstrate that multiple autism spectrum disorder (ASD) models show gait and posture deficits, implying this is a general feature of ASD. We conduct a large strain survey of 1898 mice, and find that gait and whole body posture measures are highly heritable in the laboratory mouse, and fall into three classes. Furthermore, the reference mouse strain, C57BL/6J, has a distinctly different gait and posture compared to other standard laboratory and wild-derived strains. We conduct a genome wide association study (GWAS) to define the genetic architecture of mouse movement in the open field. In sum, we describe a simple, sensitive, accurate, scalable, and ethologically relevant method of mouse gait and whole body posture analysis for behavioral neurogenetics.

However, these social contacts can also facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases through a population. Animals engaging in social interactions must therefore face a trade-off between the potential informational benefits and the risk of acquiring disease. In order to understand how this trade-off can influence animal sociality, it is necessary to quantify the effects of different social structures on individuals’ likelihood of acquiring information versus infection Theoretical models have suggested that modular social networks, associated with the formation of groups or sub-groups, can slow spread of infection by trapping it within particular groups. However these social structures will not necessarily impact the spread of information in the same way if its transmission is considered as a “complex contagion”, e.g. through individuals copying the majority (conformist learning). Here we use simulation models to demonstrate that modular networks can promote the spread of information relative to the spread of infection, but only when the network is fragmented and group sizes are small. We show that the difference in transmission between information and disease is maximised for more well-connected social networks when the likelihood of transmission is intermediate. Our results have important implications for understanding the selective pressures operating on the social structure of animal societies, revealing that highly fragmented networks such as those formed in fission-fusion social groups and multilevel societies can be effective in modulating the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.Significance statement Risk of infection is commonly regarded as one of the costs of animal social behaviours, while the potential for acquiring useful information is seen as a benefit. Balancing this risk of infection with the potential to gain useful information is one of the key trade-offs facing animals that engage in social interactions. In order to better understand this trade-off, it is necessary to quantify how different social structures can promote access to useful information while minimising risk of infection. We used simulations of disease and information spread to examine how group sizes and social network fragmentation influences both these transmission processes. Our models find that more subdivided networks slow the spread of disease far more than infection, but only group sizes are small. Our results demonstrate that showing that fragmented social structures can be more effective in balancing the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.",418,35,84,31.0

Adaptive behaviors based on learning can emerge thanks to an interdependence between the acquisition of information over time and movement decisions. The study of how spatio-ecological knowledge is constructed throughout the life of an individual has not been carried out in a quantitative and comprehensive way, hindered by the lack of knowledge of the information an animal already has of its environment at the time monitoring begins. Identifying how animals use memory to make beneficial decisions is fundamental to developing a general theory of animal movement and space use. Here we propose several mobility models based on memory and perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on 11-month trajectories of 21 elk after they were released in a completely new environment. Almost all the observed animals exhibited preferential returns to previously visited patches, such that memory and random exploration phases occurred.

This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost.The simplified setup combines existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts. We built the system around an inexpensive camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and use an inexpensive tablet computer for presenting view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. The improved system is thoroughly documented.

Here we show, through model analyses and large-scale interactive behavioural experiments with 467 human subjects, that conformist influence can indeed promote favourable risk taking in repeated risky decision making, even though many individuals are systematically biased towards adverse risk aversion. Although strong positive feedback conferred by copying the majority’s behaviour could result in unfavourable informational cascades, our dynamic model of collective behaviour identified a key role for increasing exploration by negative feedback arising when a weak minority influence undermines the inherent behavioural bias. This ‘collective behavioural rescue’, emerging through coordination of positive and negative feedback, highlights a benefit of collective learning in a broader range of environmental conditions than previously assumed and resolves the ostensible paradox of adaptive collective flexibility under conformist influences.",1384,179,418,26.0

These projections, however, generally do not call much attention to the role of behaviour, an essential thermoregulatory mechanism of many ectotherms. Here we characterize species-specific locomotor and respiratory responses to acute ambient warming in two highly stenothermic Antarctic Notothenioid fishes, one of which (Chaenocephalus aceratus) lacks haemoglobin and appears to be less tolerant to thermal stress as compared to the other (Notothenia coriiceps), which expresses haemoglobin. At the onset of ambient warming, both species perform distinct locomotor manoeuvres that appear to include avoidance reactions. In response to unavoidable progressive hyperthermia, fishes demonstrate a range of species-specific manoeuvres, all of which appear to provide some mitigation of the deleterious effects of obligatory thermoconformation and to compensate for increasing metabolic demand by enhancing the efficacy of branchial respiration. As temperature continues to rise, Chaenocephalus aceratus supplements these behaviours with intensive pectoral fin fanning which may facilitate cutaneous respiration through its scaleless integument, and Notothenia coriiceps manifests respiratory-locomotor coupling during repetitive startle-like manoeuvres which may further augment gill ventilation. The latter behaviours, found only in Notothenia coriiceps, have highly stereotyped appearance resembling Fixed Action Pattern sequences. Altogether, this behavioural flexibility could contribute to the reduction of the detrimental effects of acute thermal stress within a limited thermal range. In an ecologically relevant setting, this may enable efficient thermoregulation of fishes by habitat selection, thus facilitating their resilience in persistent environmental change.",570,40,154,62.0

The dear enemy effect is hypothesized to be adaptive by reducing unnecessary aggressive interactions with individuals that are not a threat to territory ownership. A key prediction of this hypothesis, that individual fitness will be affected by variation in the speed and extent to which individuals reduce their aggression towards neighbours relative to strangers, has never been tested. We used a series of song playbacks to measure the change in response of male great tits on their breeding territories to a simulated establishment of a neighbour on an adjacent territory. Males reduced their approach to the speaker and sang fewer songs on later repetitions of the playback trials, consistent with a dear enemy effect through habituation learning. However, not all males discriminated between the neighbour and stranger playbacks at the end of the series of trials, and there was evidence that individuals consistently differed from one another in performing this discrimination. We monitored nests and analysed offspring paternity to determine male reproductive success. Unexpectedly, individuals that exhibited dear enemy behaviour towards the simulated neighbour did not have higher reproductive success, and in fact one measure, total offspring biomass, was lower for individuals that showed the dear enemy effect. Although the general capability to recognize neighbours is most likely adaptive, it seems that individuals who decrease their responsiveness to familiar neighbours too quickly may gain no advantage or even be at a disadvantage.",515,40,106,54.0

In social insects, discriminating between colony members and aliens is subjected to this trade-off as rapid and accurate rejection of enemies is of primary importance for the maintenance and ecological success of insect societies. Recognition cues distinguishing aliens from nestmates are embedded in the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) layer and vary among colonies. In walking carpenter ants, exposure to formic acid (FA), an alarm pheromone, improves accuracy of nestmate recognition by decreasing both alien acceptance and nestmate rejection. Here we studied the effect of FA exposure on the spontaneous aggressive mandible opening response of harnessed Camponotus aethiops ants presented with either nestmate or alien CHCs. FA modulated both MOR accuracy and the latency to respond to odours of conspecifics. In particular, FA decreased MOR towards nestmates but increased it towards aliens. Furthermore, FA decreased MOR latency towards aliens but not towards nestmates. As response latency can be used as a proxy of response speed, we conclude that contrary to the prediction of the SAT theory, ants did not trade off speed against accuracy in the process of nestmate recognition.Summary statement Exposure to an alarm pheromone increases both latency and accuracy of the response to recognition cues in ants",543,53,106,25.0

For an unbiased view and well-powered analysis of the mentioned effects, a systematic review at Medline (Pubmed) followed by a meta-analysis was performed.

To cope with this challenge, males apply various behavioral and physiological strategies to maximize their paternity rates. Previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster established a link between the composition of the social environment and the reproductive success of individual male flies. While most studies until now focused on the adaptive responses of male flies to the presence of rival males, little is known about whether the outcomes of sexual interactions with female partners affect male-male social interactions in a competitive environment such as the social group. Here we show that repeated failures to mate promote a coordinated physiological and behavioral responses that can serve to increase paternity chances over mating rivals. We exposed male flies to sexual deprivation or successful mating and analyzed the behavioral repertoires of individuals within groups and the structure of their emerging social networks. We discovered that failures to mate and successful mating generate distinct emergent group interactions and structures, where sexually deprived males form low density social networks and actively minimize their encounters with other group members, while increasing their aggressive behavior. In addition, sexually deprived male flies elevate the production of seminal fluid proteins (known to facilitate post-mating responses in females) and extend mating duration upon mating with receptive females, altogether leading to reduced re-mating rates. Our results demonstrate the existence of a flexible mating strategy that may provide a short-term fitness advantage over competing rivals and pave the path for using simple model organisms to dissect the neurobiology of social plasticity as coping strategy to living in a highly dynamic environment as the social domain.",792,90,148,31.0

We here find that honey bee workers (Apis mellifera) that had been experimentally immune-challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) often exited the hive and subsequently died; some individuals were dragged out by other workers, while others appeared to leave voluntarily. In a second experiment, we found that healthy workers treated with surface chemicals from LPS-treated bees were evicted from the hive more often than controls, indicating that immune-challenged bees produce chemical cues or signals that elicit their eviction. Thirdly, we observed pairs of bees in the lab, and found that pairs spent more time apart when one member of the pair had received LPS, relative to controls. Our findings suggest that immune-challenged bees altruistically banish themselves, and that workers evict sick individuals which they identify using olfactory cues, putatively because of (kin) selection to limit the spread of pathogens within colonies.",1809,275,390,20.0

Through high-throughput larva tracking, we characterize how the likelihood of each response depends on vibration intensity and on the timing of repeated vibration pulses. By examining transitions between behavioral states at the population and individual levels, we investigate how the animals habituate to the stimulus patterns. We identify time constants associated with desensitization to prolonged vibration, with re-sensitization during removal of a stimulus, and additional layers of habituation that operate in the overall response. Known memory-deficient mutants exhibit distinct behavior profiles and habituation time constants.

The technique combines prior knowledge of the wingspan of the bird with a camera calibration procedure that needs to be used only once in the lifetime of the system. The system delivers the exact 3D coordinates of the bird, and its roll angle, at the time of every full wing extension and uses interpolated height estimates to compute the 3D positions of the bird in the video frames between successive wing extensions.

Human subjects then learnt these tasks using a feedback-based approach. We found, as hypothesised, that subject performance was significantly higher on the second task if it shared the same subspace as the first. Additionally, accuracy was positively correlated over subjects learning same-subspace tasks, and negatively correlated for those learning different-subspace tasks. These results were compared to the behaviour of a Neural Network model trained using sequential Bayesian learning. Human performance was found to be consistent with a minimal capacity variant of this model. Networks with an increased representational capacity, and networks without Bayesian learning, did not show these transfer effects. We propose that the concept of shared subspaces provides a useful framework for the experimental study of human multitask and transfer learning.Author summary How does knowledge gained from previous experience affect learning of new tasks ? This question of “Transfer Learning” has been addressed by teachers, psychologists, and more recently by researchers in the fields of neural networks and machine learning. Leveraging constructs from machine learning, we designed pairs of learning tasks that either shared or did not share a common subspace. We compared the dynamics of transfer learning in humans with those of a multitask neural network model, finding that human performance was consistent with a minimal capacity variant of the model. Learning was boosted in the second task if the same subspace was shared between tasks. Additionally, accuracy between tasks was positively correlated but only when they shared the same subspace. Our results highlight the roles of subspaces, showing how they could act as a learning boost if shared, and be detrimental if not.",1435,168,336,31.0

These effects are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies indicate that the brain social decision-making network (SDN) plays a key role in guiding experience-induced behavioral change. Also, while most studies have focused on how winning and losing experiences alter aggression, growing evidence points to these experiences driving multiple behavioral effects, including changes in the ability to learn. In mangrove rivulus fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), we discovered that single winning experiences significantly improved spatial learning but not risk-avoidance learning, whereas single losing experiences drove the exact opposite to occur. These results provide strong evidence that winning and losing modulate diverse behaviors served by key nodes within the SDN, specifically the dorsolateral pallium (Dl; fish homolog to mammalian hippocampus, which serves spatial learning) and dorsomedial pallium (Dm; fish homolog to mammalian basolateral amygdala, which responds to fear). We therefore quantified whole-proteome expression within the forebrain (where Dm and Dl are located) of adult rivulus with divergent social experiences. We discovered 23 proteins were significantly differentially expressed in the forebrains of winners and losers. Differentially expressed proteins in losers related to modulation of cellular processes, apoptosis and learning while those in winners related to neuronal plasticity, neuroendocrine homeostasis, energy utilization, and learning. These results imply that winner-loser effects might be governed by very different patterns of protein expression, which could explain why winners and losers show such pronounced differences in behavioral performance.Significance Statement Social interactions permeate the daily lives of most animals and often result in changes in behavior for all parties. This implies that social experiences reorganize the brain in ways that promote the expression of alternative behaviors, or that help individuals cope with the outcome of such interactions. But how do aggressive interactions sculpt the brain at the molecular level? We used an emerging model organism, Kryptolebias marmoratus, to examine whether experiences modulate learning ability and then probe the potential neural mechanisms underlying these behavioral changes. We discovered that single winning and losing experiences dramatically altered spatial learning and risk-avoidance learning, respectively, indicating that winning and losing experiences have markedly different effects on the brain and cognitive processes.Classification Biological Sciences, Ecology",460,51,80,38.0

Male golden rocket frogs (Anomaloglossus beebei) recognize the advertisement calls of conspecific territory neighbors and display a “dear enemy effect” by responding less aggressively to neighbors than strangers, while male Kai rocket frogs (A. kaiei) do not. Our results did not support the identity signaling hypothesis: both species produced advertisement calls that contain similar amounts of identity information. Our results did support the identity reception hypothesis: both species exhibited habituation of aggression to playbacks simulating the arrival of a new neighbor, but only golden rocket frogs showed renewed aggression when they subsequently heard calls from a different male.

Patch exploitation is a canonical foraging behavior, but a systematic treatment of how animals cope with uncertainty is lacking. To address these shortcomings, we develop a normative theory of patch foraging decisions, proposing mechanisms by which foraging behaviors emerge in the face of uncertainty. Our model foragers statistically and sequentially infer patch resource yields using Bayesian updating based on their resource encounter history. A decision to leave a patch is triggered when the certainty of the patch type or the estimated yield of the patch fall below a threshold. The timescale over which uncertainty in resource availability persists strongly impacts behavioral variables like patch residence times and decision rules determining patch departures. When patch depletion is slow, as in habitat selection, departures are characterized by a reduction of uncertainty, suggesting the forager resides in a low-yielding patch. Uncertainty leads patch-exploiting foragers to overharvest (underharvest) patches with initially low (high) resource yields in comparison to predictions of the marginal value theorem. These results extend optimal foraging theory and motivate a variety of behavioral experiments investigating patch foraging behavior.",1097,77,261,20.0

The positive effects on cognition in aged CYP46A1 overexpressing female mice were accompanied by morphological changes in dendritic spines and enhancement of estrogen receptor signaling in hippocampus.

Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless 2-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get “stuck” in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less, but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices.

A striking example is that female vampire bats often regurgitate blood to socially bonded kin and nonkin that failed in their nightly hunt. Food-sharing relationships form via preferred associations and social grooming within roosts. However, it remains unclear whether these cooperative relationships extend beyond the roost. To evaluate if long-term cooperative relationships in vampire bats play a role in foraging, we tested if foraging encounters measured by proximity sensors could be explained by wild roosting proximity, kinship, or rates of co-feeding, social grooming, and food sharing during 22 months in captivity. We assessed evidence for six hypothetical scenarios of social foraging, ranging from individual to collective hunting. We found that female vampire bats departed their roost individually, but often re-united far outside the roost. Nonrandomly repeating foraging encounters were predicted by within-roost association and histories of cooperation in captivity, even when controlling for kinship. Foraging bats demonstrated both affiliative and competitive interactions and a previously undescribed call type. We suggest that social foraging could have implications for social evolution if ‘local’ cooperation within the roost and ‘global’ competition outside the roost enhances fitness interdependence between frequent roostmates.",745,45,189,16.0

Escape behavior is essential to avoid the predator’s attack and is more frequently observed than other defensive behaviors. In some species, multiple escape responses are exhibited with different movements. It has been reported that the approaching speed of a predator is important in choosing which escape action to take among the multiple responses. However, it is unknown whether other aspects of sensory stimuli, that indicate the predator’s approach, affect the selection of escape responses. We focused on two distinct escape responses (running and jumping) to a stimulus (short airflow) in crickets and examined the effects of multiple stimulus aspects (including the angle, velocity, and duration) on the choice between these escape responses. We found that the faster and longer the airflow, the more frequently the crickets jumped, meaning that they could choose their escape response depending on both velocity and duration of the stimulus. This result suggests that the neural basis for choosing escape responses includes the integration process of multiple stimulus parameters. It was also found that the moving speed and distance changed depending on the stimulus velocity and duration during running but not during jumping, suggesting higher adaptability of the running escape. In contrast, the movement direction was accurately controlled regardless of the stimulus parameters in both responses. The escape direction depended only on stimulus orientation, but not on velocity and duration.Summary statement When air currents triggering escape are faster and longer, crickets more frequently jump than run.

In the insect brain, this process is thought to be carried out in the mushroom bodies under control of octopaminergic and dopaminergic neurons. It was assumed that appetitive learning is governed by octopaminergic neurons, while dopamine is required for aversive learning. This view has been recently challenged: Both neurotransmitters seem to be involved in both types of memory in bees and flies. Here, we test which neurotransmitters are required for appetitive learning in ants. We trained Lasius niger ant workers to discriminate two mixtures of linear hydrocarbons and associate one of them with a sucrose reward. We analysed the behaviour of the trained ants using machine learning and found that they preferred the rewarded odour over the other, a preference that was stable for at least 24 hours. We then treated the ants before learning with either epinastine, an octopamine receptor blocker, or with flupentixol, a dopamine receptor blocker. Ants with blocked octopamine receptors did not remember the rewarded odour. Octopamine signalling is thus necessary for the formation of appetitive memory. In contrast, ants with blocked dopamine receptors initially learned the rewarded odour but failed to retrieve this memory 24 hours later. Dopamine is thus required for long-term memory consolidation during appetitive conditioning, independent of short-term memory formation.

Philippides",2021.04.18.440333;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.18.440333,"SummaryWood ants were trained indoors to follow a route in a chosen magnetic direction from the centre of a small, circular arena to find a drop of sucrose at the edge. The arena, surrounded by a white cylindrical wall, was in the centre of a 3D coil system that generated an inclined Earth strength magnetic field in any horizontal direction. Between trials, the chosen magnetic training direction was rotated to a new orientation. Tests were given without food and with fresh or reversed paper on the floor of the arena. In a significant number of tests, ants left the centre facing the goal, or in the opposite direction, but they mostly failed to reach the goal. Tests given early in the day, before any training, show that ants remember the magnetic route direction overnight. On some training trials, the position of the sucrose was also indicated by a black stripe. Not uncommonly, ants first moved in the opposite direction to the stripe before switching to the correct direction. Travel away from the reward seems to express the ant’s uncertainty about the correct path to take. Tests show that this uncertainty may stem from competing directional cues linked to the room, suggesting that ants are reluctant to rely on magnetic information alone. We conclude that ants can remember a route direction defined by an Earth-strength magnetic field and that they express any uncertainty about the correct direction by moving for a stretch in the opposite direction. In a second experiment, an upright and an inverted triangle were fixed 90° from each other to the inside of the cylinder. Sucrose was placed beneath one of the triangles, dependent on the direction of the magnetic field. Ants failed to master this task and to approach the magnetically cued triangle. Instead, they preferred to approach the upright triangle. The ants were again uncertain of the correct direction and expressed this uncertainty through paths that had segments directed towards both the inverted and the upright triangles.",478,35,119,25.0

Therefore, understanding the impact of schedules on animal behaviour can be a valuable tool to improve welfare, however information on overnight behaviour and behaviour in the absence of husbandry staff remains rare. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are highly social marine mammals and the most common cetacean found in captivity. They communicate using frequency modulated signature whistles which are individually distinctive and used as a contact call. We investigated the vocal behaviour of ten dolphins housed in three social groups at uShaka Sea World dolphinarium to determine how acoustic behavioural patterns link to dolphinarium routines. Investigation focused on overnight behaviour, housing decisions, weekly patterns, and transitional periods between presence and absence of husbandry staff. Recordings were made from 17h00 – 07h00 over 24 nights, spanning May to August 2018. Whistle production rate decreased soon after husbandry staff left the facility, was low over night, and increased upon arrival. Results indicated elevate arousal states associated with the morning arrival and presence of husbandry staff and heightened excitement associated with feeding. Housing in pool configurations which limited visual contact between certain groups were characterised by lower vocal production rates. Production of signature whistles was greater over the weekends compared to weekdays however total whistle production did not differ between weekends and weekdays. Heightened arousal associated with staff arrival was reflected in the structural characteristics of signature whistles, particularly maximum frequency, frequency range and number of whistle loops. Overall, these results revealed a link between scheduled activity and associated behavioural responses, which can be used as a baseline for future welfare monitoring where changes in normal behaviour may reflect shifts in welfare state.",409,39,94,44.0

The understanding of these systems and their application can benefit from modeling and analysis of the underlying algorithms. In this study, we define a modeling framework that can be used to formally represent all components of such algorithms. As an example application of the framework, we adapt to it the much-studied house-hunting algorithm used by emigrating colonies of Temnothorax ants to reach consensus on a new nest. We provide a Python simulator that encodes accurate individual behavior rules and produces simulated behaviors consistent with empirical observations, on both the individual and group levels. Critically, through multiple simulated experiments, our results highlight the value of individual sensitivity to site population in ensuring consensus. With the help of this social information, our model successfully reproduces experimental results showing the high cognitive capacity of colonies and their rational time investment during decision-making, and also predicts the pros and cons of social information with regard to the colonies’ ability to avoid and repair splits. Additionally, we use the model to make new predictions about several unstudied aspects of emigration behavior. Our results indicate a more complex relationship between individual behavior and the speed/accuracy trade-off than previously appreciated. The model proved relatively weak at resolving colony divisions among multiple sites, suggesting either limits to the ants’ ability to reach consensus, or an aspect of their behavior not captured in our model. It is our hope that these insights and predictions can inspire further research from both the biology and computer science community.",1375,270,339,75.0

Using long-term automated tracking of over 4,200 individually-identified bees Apis mellifera, we use behavioral metrics to quantify and compare behavior. We show that individuals exhibit behavioral variation along two dominant axes that represent nest substrate use and movement within the nest. Across lifetimes, we find that individuals differ in foraging onset, and that certain bees exhibit lifelong consistencies in their movement patterns. Furthermore, we examine a period of sudden nectar availability where the honey stores tripled over 6 days, and see that the colony exhibits a distributed shift in activity that did not require a large-scale colony reorganization. Our quantitative approach shows how collective units differ over days and lifetimes, and how sources of variation and variability contribute to the colony’s robust yet flexible response.",2558,308,840,28.0

During therapy and other forms of training involving extinction, subjects are typically exposed to several sessions with a similar structure. The effects of this repeated exposure are not well understood. Here, we studied the behavior of pigeons across several sessions of a discrimination learning task in context A, extinction in context B, and a return to context A to test the context-dependent return of the learned responses (ABA renewal). By focusing on individual learning curves across animals, we uncovered a session-dependent variability of behavior: (1) During extinction, pigeons preferred the unrewarded alternative choice in one-third of the sessions, predominantly during the first one. (2) In later sessions, abrupt transitions of behavior at the onset of context B emerged, and (3) the renewal effect decayed as sessions progressed. We show that the observed results can be parsimoniously accounted for by a computational model based only on associative learning between stimuli and actions. Our work thus demonstrates the critical importance of studying the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning in individual sessions, and the power of “simple” associative learning processes.",1406,284,345,27.0

Bilateral amygdala damage results in impairments in both of these domains. There are extensive reciprocal connections between these prefrontal areas and the amygdala; however, it is not known whether the dissociable roles of OFC and MFC depend on functional interactions with the amygdala. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with crossed surgical disconnection of the amygdala and either MFC (MFC x AMY, n=4) or OFC (OFC x AMY, n=4) to a group of unoperated controls (CON, n=5). All monkeys were assessed for their performance on two tasks to measure: (1) food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of social and nonsocial stimuli in a test of social interest, and (2) object choices based on current food value using reinforcer devaluation in a test of goal-directed decision making. Compared to the CON group, the MFC x AMY group, but not the OFC x AMY group, showed significantly reduced food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of conspecifics, indicating reduced social valuation and/or interest. By contrast, on the devaluation task, group OFC x AMY, but not group MFC x AMY, displayed deficits on object choices following changes in food value. These data indicate that the MFC and OFC must functionally interact with the amygdala to support normative social and nonsocial valuation, respectively.Significance Statement Ascribing value to conspecifics (social) vs. objects (nonsocial) may be supported by distinct but overlapping brain networks. Here we test whether two nonoverlapping regions of the prefrontal cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, must causally interact with the amygdala to sustain social valuation and goal-directed decision making, respectively. We found that these prefrontal-amygdala circuits are functionally dissociable, lending support for the idea that medial frontal and orbital frontal cortex make independent contributions to cognitive appraisals of the environment.

Five groups, including a control group (Con, ten healthy rats) and forty morphine-dependent rats were considered as follows (n=10/group): 1) sedentary-dependent (Sed-D); 2) endurance exercise-dependent (En-D); 3) strength exercise-dependent (St-D); and 4) concurrent exercise-dependent (Co-D). The exercise training groups were subjected to endurance, strength, and concurrent training 5 days per week for 10 weeks. After training sessions, the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude in DG were determined in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the PP. For assessing neurogenesis NeuroD level was evaluated after performing all experiments. Concurrent training increased PS amplitude and EPSP than the control group. NeuroD in the morphine-dependent rats significantly decreased, but concurrent training returned the NeuroD to the healthy rat level.

The study examined the effects of extrinsic motivation, manipulated via monetary reward, and curiosity, a form of intrinsic motivation, on long-term memory in healthy younger and older adults. During the incidental encoding phase on Day 1, 60 younger and 53 older participants viewed high- and low-curiosity trivia items as well as unrelated face stimuli. Half of the participants in each age group received financial rewards for correctly guessing trivia answers. On Day 2, participants completed a trivia recall test and an old-new recognition test for the face stimuli. Both curiosity and reward were associated with enhanced trivia recall, but the effects were interactive, such that only low-curiosity items benefitted from monetary reward. Neither curiosity nor reward affected face recognition performance in either age group. These findings indicate that individual and joint effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on long-term memory are relatively preserved in healthy aging, a finding that highlights the viability of motivational strategies for memory enhancement into old age.

MD lesion rats needed more trials to learn the rewarded sensory dimension. However, once the choice response strategy was established, learning further two-choice discriminations in the same sensory dimension, and reversals of the reward contingencies in the same dimension, were unimpaired. Critically though, MD lesion rats were impaired during the extra-dimensional shift, when they must rapidly update the optimal choice response strategy. Behavioral analyses showed MD lesion rats had significantly reduced ‘on-the-fly’ correct second choice responses.

We analyze Bayesian models designed to mimic fully-factorial experimental studies of within and transgenerational plasticity (TWP), in which parents, offspring, neither or both are exposed to cues from predators, to determine how different durations of cue exposure for parents and offspring, the devaluation of information from parents or the degradation of information from parents would affect offspring estimates of environmental states related to risk of predation at the end of such experiments. We show that the effects of different cue durations, the devaluation of information from parents, and the degradation of information from parents on offspring estimates are all expected to vary as a function of interactions with two other key parameters of information-based models of TWP: parental priors and the relative cue reliability in the different treatments. Our results suggest empiricists should expect to observe considerable variation across experimental studies of TWP based on simple principles of information-updating, without needing to invoke additional assumptions about costs, tradeoffs, development constraints, the fitness consequences of different trait values, or other factors.",502,45,110,37.0

Coalition formation by middle- to low-rankers can be seen as a collaborative effort to modify the distribution of reproductive success within the group, so that they gain more than they would do otherwise. It has been pointed out, on the other hand, that a coalition of top-ranking males could hardly be profitable in the sense that they would gain little additional benefit from making collaborative effort. Here we report our novel observation of facultative sharing of mating opportunities among males in a wild population of stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides) as a possible case of coalition-like behavior in which dominant males jointly guard females from mating with subordinate males and actively share mating opportunities within the allies. First, we report our novel observation of facultative sharing of mating opportunities in male stump-tailed macaques, where two or more males remain in close proximity to and copulate with a female in turn without contesting or sneaking. Second, considering the kind of coalition formation in which dominant males collaboratively exclude subordinates from mating competition and thereby strengthen the reproductive skew that already exists, we specify, by means of mathematical modeling, the condition for this kind of coalition formation to be selectively favored. Finally, we derive predictions about the occurrence of the coalition-like behavior depending on ecological and demographic factors, and test them empirically using data from the five groups of stump-tailed macaques in our study population.",2104,421,511,38.0

Countless articles uncovered the advantages of trichromacy (i.e., color vision expressed by most humans) in detecting yellowish/reddish targets against a background of mature green leaves. Unfortunately, the same attention was not offered to achromatic visual information, that had their physiological foundations much more explored than their possible adaptive function. So far, mostly because of studies conducted in humans, we know that achromatic cues might also play an important role in object identification, particularly when camouflage is involved. For instance, dichromacy (i.e., color vision expressed by many colorblind humans), favors the detection of camouflaged targets by exploitation of shape cues. The present study sought to evaluate the relative importance of color and shape cues on the detection of food targets by female and male marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Animals were observed with respect to their foraging behavior and the number of food targets captured.

Instead of asynchronous vigilance, some social species synchronize their vigilance bouts or take turns acting as sentinels. A sentinel system assumes that sentinels are located at raised positions, produce alarm signals when detecting danger, and alternate vigilance bouts. However, despite the importance of sentinel systems in understanding anti-predator behavior, many species with a described sentinel system have not been tested yet for the assumption of taking turns. To increase our knowledge on the evolution of vigilance behavior, we studied whether vigilance is coordinated in Barbary ground squirrels, Atlantoxerus getulus. We show that vigilance was coordinated but synchronized instead of taking turns. In this case, synchronized vigilance may be 1) an optimal activity when in good body condition (low costs), and, 2) an adaptation to anthropogenically altered habitats (large benefits). We demonstrate that synchronized vigilance may have greater fitness benefits than sentinel behavior in habitats where the field of view is obstructed by man-made structures and individuals must watch each other’s backs for terrestrial predators. We conclude that it is essential to test assumptions of coordination and, thus, to analyze coordination to describe sentinel systems.Significance Statement Vigilance behavior can be vital to an animal’s survival. A long-standing assumption of vigilance in social species is that vigilance bouts are independent among group members; but that does not always hold, as some species can coordinate their vigilance. Coordination of vigilance, either by taking turns acting as sentinels or synchronizing vigilance bouts, reduces the cost of the trade-off between feeding and predation risk. A sentinel system assumes that sentinels are vigilant from raised positions, warn group members of danger, and alternate vigilance bouts. However, the assumption of alternating vigilance bouts remains poorly tested. We tested this assumption in invasive Barbary ground squirrels. We found that instead of alternating, individuals synchronized their vigilance bouts. Barbary ground squirrels may synchronize their vigilance 1) as an optimal activity when in good body condition, and, 2) to watch each other’s back.",851,159,258,24.0

Using custom-made telemetric backpack technology to monitor song-based communication from freely-behaving canaries, we show that males temporally overlap their songs during aggressive ‘duels’. Singing duels induce an unexpected fast plasticity in song length, thereby enhancing singing performance and flexibility of a sexually-selected behavior. Remarkably, dueling canaries sing acoustically-similar songs, suggesting that competition within a specific song acoustic space drives dueling behavior.

Leading models of incentive learning assume that motivational value is assigned to cues based on the total amount of reward they signal (i.e., their state value). Based on recent findings, we lay out the alternative hypothesis that cue-elicited reward predictions may actually suppress the motivation to seek out new rewards through instrumental behavior in order to facilitate efficient retrieval of a reward that is already expected, before it is lost or stolen. According to this view, cue-motivated reward seeking should be inversely related to the magnitude of an expected reward, since there is more to lose by failing to secure a large reward than a small reward. We investigated the influence of expected reward magnitude on PIT expression. Hungry rats were initially trained to lever press for food pellets before undergoing Pavlovian conditioning, in which two distinct auditory cues signaled food pellet delivery at cue offset. Reward magnitude was varied across cues and groups. While all groups had at least one cue that signaled three food pellets, the alternate cue signaled either one (Group 1/3), three (Group 3/3), or nine food pellets (Group 3/9). PIT testing revealed that the motivational influence of reward-predictive cues on lever pressing varied inversely with expected reward magnitude, with the 1-pellet cue augmenting performance and the 3- and 9-pellet cues suppressing performance, particularly near the expected time of reward delivery. This pattern was mirrored by opposing changes in the food-port entry behavior, which varied positively with expected reward magnitude. We discuss how these findings may relate to cognitive control over cue-motivated behavior.",436,77,127,21.0

Striking a balance between exploitation of social information and exploration for better alternatives is essential to prevent the spread of maladaptive traditions. We investigated this balance during cumulative route development in the homing pigeon Columba livia. We quantified causal interactions within pairs of birds in a transmission-chain experiment and determined how birds with different levels of experience contributed to the exploration– exploitation trade-off. Newly introduced naïve individuals were initially more likely to initiate exploration than experienced birds, but the pair soon settled into a pattern of alternating leadership with both birds contributing equally. Experimental pairs showed an oscillating pattern of exploration over generations that might facilitate the discovery of more efficient routes. Our results introduce a new perspective on the roles of leadership and information pooling in the context of collective learning.",524,47,147,28.0

Such predictions are largely based on photic phase-response curves (PRCs) generated from animals housed under seasonally agnostic equatorial photoperiods with alternating 12-hour segments of light and darkness. Most of the human population, however, lives at northerly latitudes (20-50° N of the Equator) where seasonal variations in the light-dark schedule are pronounced. Here, we address this disconnect by constructing the first high-resolution seasonal atlas for light-induced circadian phase-resetting. Testing the light responses of nearly 4,000 Drosophila at 120 timepoints across 5 seasonally relevant photoperiods (i.e., LD 8:16, 10:14, 12:12, 14:10, and 16:8; 24 hourly intervals surveyed in each), we determined that many aspects of the circadian PRC waveform are conserved with increasing daylength. Surprisingly though, irrespective of LD schedule, the start of the PRCs always remained anchored to the timing of subjective sunset, creating a differential overlap of the advance zone with the morning hours after subjective sunrise that was maximized under summer photoperiods and minimized under winter photoperiods. These data suggest that circadian photosensitivity is effectively extinguished by the early winter morning and out of optimal phase alignment with the wake schedules of many individuals (which revolve around the timing of sunrise regardless of season). They raise the possibility that phototherapy protocols for conditions such as seasonal depression might be improved with programmed light exposure during the final hours of sleep.",549,53,143,30.0

The method, which has the potential to help identify and monitor firefly populations worldwide, was successfully implemented in various natural swarms. However, camera calibration remained tedious and time-consuming. Here, we propose and implement an algorithm that calibrates the cameras directly from the data, requiring minimal user input. We explain the principles of the calibration-free algorithm, and demonstrate the ease and efficiency of its implementation.

Niven, Paul Graham, Barbara Webb",2021.01.28.428620;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.28.428620,"Insects can navigate efficiently in both novel and familiar environments, and this requires flexiblity in how they are guided by sensory cues. A prominent landmark, for example, can ellicit strong innate behaviours (attraction or menotaxis) but can also be used, after learning, as a specific directional cue as part of a navigation memory. However, the mechanisms that allow both pathways to co-exist, interact or override each other are largely unknown. Here we propose a model for the behavioural integration of innate and learned guidance based on the neuroanatomy of the central complex (CX), adapted to control landmark guided behaviours. We consider a reward signal provided either by an innate attraction to landmarks or a long-term visual memory in the mushroom bodies (MB) that modulates the formation of a local vector memory in the CX. Using an operant strategy for a simulated agent exploring a simple world containing a single visual cue, we show how the generated short-term memory can support both innate and learned steering behaviour. In addition, we show how this architecture is consistent with the observed effects of unilateral MB lesions in ants that cause a reversion to innate behaviour. We suggest the formation of a directional memory in the CX can be interpreted as transforming rewarding (positive or negative) sensory signals into a mapping of the environment that describes the geometrical attractiveness (or repulsion). We discuss how this scheme might represent an ideal way to combine multisensory information gathered during the exploration of an environment and support optimized cue integration.Author summary In this paper, we modeled the neural pathway allowing insects to perform landmark guided behaviours using their internal compass. First, we observed the intrinsic property of the connectome, extracted from drosophila online database, between the internal compass neurons and the steering neurons to support an oriented behaviour towards a single landmark. Then, we proposed and evaluated an adaptation of the bees path integration neural circuit, to sustain flexible landmark guidance behaviours such as attraction or menotaxis. We showed the model ability to form a memory during the exploration of the local environment to support both innate or learned navigation behaviour using a single landmark in the environment. In addtion, we demonstrated the transformation of a simple goodness/badness signal, from innate or long-term memory pathways, into an oriented steering signal that could be applied to other sensory pathways. Furthermore, by reproducing lesion experiments in the mushroom bodies of wood ants we highlight the consistency of the model with biological observation. We then discuss the different emergent properties and the potential outcome that this local, and operant, memory supports.",1420,165,509,24.0

While synchrony to regular (isochronous) rhythms is well documented, synchrony to non-isochronous stimuli, with multiple components at unequal time intervals, is rarer. Several katydid species with isochronous calls have been shown to achieve synchrony as part of their natural calling interactions in multi-individual choruses. Yet no study so far has demonstrated synchrony in any insect with a non-isochronous call. Using natural calling behaviour and playback experiments, we investigated acoustic synchrony and the mechanisms underlying it in the katydid species Mecopoda ‘Two Part Caller’. This species has a complex non-isochronous call consisting of a long trill followed by two or more chirps. We found that individual males synchronized trills and, to a lesser extent, chirps. Further investigation of trill synchrony showed that timing of trills is modified by external trills but not chirps. Chirp synchrony is modified by external chirps but also by trills. We suggest a two-oscillator model underlying synchrony in this species and discuss the implications for the evolution of acoustic synchrony.",933,148,188,26.0

The first, prospect theory, assumes that decision-makers use static mathematical functions, utility and probability weighting, to calculate the values of alternatives. The second, reinforcement learning theory, posits that dynamic mathematical functions update the values of alternatives based on experience through reward prediction error (RPE). To date, these theories have been examined in isolation without reference to one another. Therefore, it remains unclear whether RPE affects a decision-maker’s utility and/or probability weighting functions, or whether these functions are indeed static as in prospect theory. Here, we propose a dynamic prospect theory model that combines prospect theory and RPE, and test this combined model using choice data on gambling behavior of captive macaques. We found that under standard prospect theory, monkeys, like humans, had a concave utility function. Unlike humans, monkeys exhibited a concave, rather than inverse-S shaped, probability weighting function. Our dynamic prospect theory model revealed that probability distortions, not the utility of rewards, solely and systematically varied with RPE: after a positive RPE, the estimated probability weighting functions became more concave, suggesting more optimistic belief about receiving rewards and over-weighted subjective probabilities at all probability levels. Thus, the probability perceptions in laboratory monkeys are not static even after extensive training, and are governed by a dynamic function well captured by the algorithmic feature of reinforcement learning. This novel evidence supports combining these two major theories to capture choice behavior under uncertainty.Significance statement We propose and test a new decision theory under uncertainty by combining pre-existing two influential theories in the neuroeconomics: prospect theory from economics and prediction error theory from reinforcement learning. Collecting a large dataset (over 60,000 gambling decisions) from laboratory monkeys enables us to test the hybrid model of these two core decision theories reliably. Our results showed over-weighted subjective probabilities at all probability levels after lucky win, indicating that positive prediction error systematically bias decision-makers more optimistically about receiving rewards. This trial-by-trial prediction-error dynamics in probability perception provides outperformed performance of the model compared to the standard static prospect theory. Thus, both static and dynamic elements coexist in monkey’s risky decision-making, an evidence contradicting the assumption of prospect theory.",1350,95,209,36.0

Naturally, with this increasing usefulness comes increasing use, particularly by non-experts. This necessitates a greater understanding of, and a better controlling for, confounding factors that may limit the system’s ability to optimally detect cognitive deficits when used as a widely accessible and commercially available standardized task. In the present study, we show a strong image preference bias in a standard pairwise discrimination task with a widely used spider-plane image pairing in a putative animal model for intellectual disability. This bias greatly influenced the performance of our experimental mice, significantly affecting the length of time it took mice to complete the task, their progress over time, and several accessory measures usefully recorded by the Bussey-Saksida touchscreen system. We further show that this bias can be corrected by using more similar image pairings without sacrificing the animal’s ability to learn to distinguish the stimuli. This approach eliminated all significant stimuli specific differences seen with the spider-plane pairing. We then analyzed the pixel composition of the various stimuli to suggest that the bias is due to a difference in image brightness. These findings highlight the importance of carefully modulating paired touchscreen stimuli to ensure equivalence prior to learning and the need for more studies of visual perception in mice, particularly as it relates to their performance in cognitive assays.",580,107,136,34.0

It carries the colony fitness through delivering future reproductive adults as well as workers that will increase the colony’s workforce. Adoption of non-nestmate brood can be a mean to increase colony’s workforce but entails the risk of rearing unrelated sexuals or social parasites. For early brood (eggs and L1 larvae), this balance is less positive as young brood need a substantial amount of resource before becoming workers. Thus, it appears beneficial for ant workers to discriminate between nestmate and alien brood using the chemical cues displayed at the brood’s surface. However, the chemical signature of ant early brood stages and its use by workers remains understudied. To fill this gap, we investigated the chemical basis of early brood nestmate and cross-species recognition in six Formicoid ants. We also tested the discrimination behaviour of workers in brood retrieval trials. We observed clear species-level cues and discrimination against heterospecific brood. We also found that eggs and most young larvae display a colony signature but that only some species discriminate against non-nestmate eggs and L1 larvae.

Are these differences causes or consequences to social life? We show that anxiety emerges from life in colony whereas sociability is a pre-existing trait. Strikingly, highest ranked individuals exhibit lower bursting activity of VTA dopamine neurons. Both pharmacogenetic inhibition of this neuronal population and the genetic inactivation of glucocorticoid receptor signalling in dopamine-sensing brain areas promote the accession to higher social ranks.

Understanding the relationship between the structural network changes and group performance in wild animals remains an outstanding problem. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluate the immediate effect of disturbance on group sociality in African savanna elephants — an example, group-living species threatened by poaching. Drawing on static association data from one free ranging population, we constructed 100 virtual networks; performed a series of experiments ‘poaching’ the oldest, socially central or random individuals; and quantified the immediate change in the theoretical indices of network connectivity and efficiency of social diffusion. Although the virtual networks never broke down, targeted elimination of the socially central conspecifics, regardless of age, decreased network connectivity and efficiency. These findings hint at the need to further study resilience by modeling network reorganization and interaction-mediated socioecological learning, empirical data permitting. Our work is unique in quantifying connectivity together with global efficiency in multiple virtual networks that represent the sociodemographic diversity of elephant populations likely found in the wild. The basic design of our simulation platform makes it adaptable for hypothesis testing about the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance or lethal management on social interactions in a variety of group-living species with limited, real-world data.Author Summary We consider the immediate response of animal groups to human disturbance by using the African savanna elephant as an example of a group-living species threatened by poaching. Previous research in one elephant population showed that poaching-induced mortality reduced social interaction among distantly related elephants, but not among close kin. Whether this type of resilience indicates that affected populations function similarity before and after poaching is an open problem. Understanding it is important because poaching often targets the largest and most socially and ecologically experienced group members. Drawing on empirical association data, we simulated poaching in 100 virtual elephant populations and eliminated the most senior or sociable members. Targeted poaching of sociable conspecifics was more impactful. Although it did not lead to population breakdown, it hampered theoretical features of interspecific associations that in other systems have been associated with group cohesion and the efficiency of transferring social information. Our findings suggest that further inquiry into the relationship between resilience to poaching and group performance is warranted. In addition, our simulation platform offers a generalizable basis for hypothesis testing in other social species, wild or captive, subject to exploitation by humans.",1076,205,302,42.0

Noradrenaline plays a significant role in sexual behavior but the contribution of noradrenaline in the control of courtship vocalizations in quail has not been well established. Using dose-dependent intracerebroventricular injection of clonidine, an α2-adrenergic receptor- specific agonist, crowing vocalization was immediately suppressed. At the same time as crow suppression by clonidine there was a reduction of immediate early gene, zenk mRNA, in the ICo; no zenk mRNA expression was detected in the dorsomedial division of the nucleus. Using histochemistry, we determined that the ICo receives noradrenergic innervation and expresses α2A-adrenergic receptor mRNA.

Rotondo, Kasia M. Bieszczad",2021.03.31.437889;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437889,"Recent investigation of memory-related functions in the auditory system have capitalized on the use of memory-modulating molecules to probe the relationship between memory and its substrates in auditory system coding. For example, epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression necessary for memory consolidation, are powerful modulators of learning-induced neuroplasticity and long-term memory formation (LTM). Inhibition of the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) promotes LTM that is highly specific for spectral features of sound. The present work demonstrates for the first time that HDAC3 inhibition also enables memory for temporal features of sound. Rats trained in an amplitude modulation (AM) rate discrimination task and treated with a selective inhibitor of HDAC3 formed memory that was unusually specific to the AM rate paired with reward. Unusually sound-specific memory revealed behaviorally was associated with a signal-specific enhancement in temporal coding in the auditory system: stronger phase-locking that was specific to the rewarded AM rate was revealed in both the surface-recorded frequency following response (FFR) and auditory cortical multiunit activity in rats treated with the HDAC3-inhibitor. Furthermore, HDAC3inhibition increased trial-to-trial cortical response consistency (relative to naïve and trained vehicle-treated rats) that generalized across different AM rates. Stronger signal-specific phase-locking correlated with individual behavioral differences in memory specificity for the AM signal. Together, these findings support that epigenetic mechanisms regulate activity-dependent processes that enhance discriminability of sensory cues encoded into LTM in both spectral and temporal domains, which may be important for remembering spectrotemporal features of sounds, e.g., as in human voices and speech.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been implicated in memory and information processing. Here, we use a pharmacological inhibitor of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in a sensory model of learning to reveal, for the first time, its ability to enable unusually precise memory for amplitude modulated sound cues. In so doing, we uncover neural substrates for memory’s “specificity” for temporal sound cues. Memory specificity was supported by auditory cortical changes in temporal coding, including greater response consistency and stronger phase-locking. HDAC3 appears to regulate effects across domains that determine specific cue saliency for behavior. Thus, epigenetic players may gate how sensory information is stored in long-term memory and can be leveraged to reveal the neural substrates of sensory details stored in memory.",735,57,146,47.0

At the same time, the BBB enables selective transport of critical nutrients and other chemicals to the brain. Many of these processes are still poorly understood. Beyond these functions, another recently recognized function is even less characterized, specifically the role of the BBB in modulating behavior by affecting neuronal function in a sex dependent manner. Notably, signaling in the adult Drosophila BBB is required for normal male courtship behavior. Courtship regulation also relies on male-specific molecules in the BBB. Our previous studies have demonstrated that adult feminization of these cells in males significantly lowered courtship. Here, we conducted microarray analysis of BBB cells isolated from males and females. Findings revealed that these cells contain male- and female-enriched transcripts, respectively. Among these transcripts, nuclear receptor DHR3/Hr46 was identified as a male-enriched BBB transcript. DHR3/Hr46 is best known for its essential roles in the ecdysone response during development and metamorphosis. In this study, we demonstrate that DR3/Hr46 is specifically required in the BBB cells of mature males for courtship behavior. The protein is localized in the nuclei of sub-perineurial glial cells (SPG), indicating that it might act as a transcriptional regulator. These data provide a catalogue of sexually dimorphic BBB transcripts and demonstrate a physiological adult role for the nuclear receptor DH3/Hr46 in the regulation of male courtship, a novel function that is independent of its developmental role.Author summary The blood brain barrier very tightly regulates which molecules can enter the brain. This is an important protection for the brain, however, it also complicates communication between molecules in the circulating fluid and the brain. In fly courtship, for example, circulating male-specific products are crucially required for normal courtship. But the neuronal circuits that ultimately control the behavior are inside the brain, separated from these molecules by the blood brain barrier. The mechanisms of this communication are not known. Here we show that the blood brain barrier itself contains sex-specific RNAs and we show that one of them, a nuclear receptor called DHR3, is required in adult males for normal courtship. These findings promise new insight into the communication between blood brain barrier and the brain.",744,73,144,39.0

Predator attacks would be directed to a non-vital, and autotomizable, body part, increasing the chance of survival. However, as body size increases it also increases the signaling area that could attract predators from greater distances, increasing the overall chance of predation. Here, we test the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between tail color and size, affecting predation probabilities. We used plasticine replicas of lizards to study the predation patterns of small and large lizards with red and blue tails. In a natural environment, we exposed six hundred replicas subjected to the attack of free-ranging predators. Large red-tailed models were attacked more quickly, and more intensely, by birds. Mammals and unidentified predators showed no preference for any size or colors. The attacks were not primarily directed to conspicuous tails when compared to the body or the head of our replicas. Our study suggests that red color signals in large lizards could enhance their detection by visually oriented predators (i.e., birds). The efficacy of conspicuous tails as a decoy may rely on associated behavioral displays, which are hard to test with static replicas.The roles of blue and red tails as decoys were not corroborated.Tail color and size interact while influencing predation rates.Larger red-tailed lizards are more prone to be attacked by birds.The benefit of having conspicuous tails appears to decrease as body size increases.",991,60,158,23.0

Ant colonies display high levels of organisational complexity, with ants fulfilling different roles at different timescales (what is known as task allocation). Factors affecting task allocation can be at the individual level (e.g., physiology), or at the group level (e.g., interaction histories). In this work, we focus on group level processes by exploring the impact of the history of interaction networks on task allocation and task switching using a previously published dataset (Mersch et al., 2013) tracking the behaviour of six Camponotus fellah colonies over 41 days. First, we investigated the architecture of interaction networks using node (individual) level network measures and their relation to the individual’s task – foraging, cleaning or nursing – and whether or not the ant switched tasks. We then explored how noisy information propagation is among ants, as a function of the colony composition (how many ants are carrying out which tasks), through the information-theoretic metric of effective information. Our results show that interaction history affected task allocation, with ants more likely to switch to a task if they had interacted with other ants carrying out that task. The degree to which interaction history affected task allocation, as well as the noise in their interactions, depended on which groups of ants are interacting. Overall, we showed that colony cohesion is stable even as ant-level network measures vary more for ants when they switched functional groups; thus ant colonies maintain a high level of information flow as determined by network analysis and ant functional groups play different roles in maintaining colony cohesion.HighlightsWe analysed the interaction networks of six Camponotus fellah coloniesWe tested how centrality and information flow affected task switchingNode-level network metrics and the information theoretic measure of effective information explain differences among functional groupsInteraction histories predicted task switching, but the strength of the effect differed across functional groups",944,75,217,32.0

Patients with this disorder have distinct behavioral phenotypes including learning deficits, anxiety, increased phobias, and hypersociability. Some studies also suggest elevated blood oxytocin and altered oxytocin receptor expression, and this oxytocin dysregulation is hypothesized to be involved in the underlying mechanisms driving a subset of these phenotypes. A ‘Complete Deletion’ mouse, modeling the hemizygous critical region deletion in Williams Syndrome, recapitulates many of the phenotypes present in humans. These Complete Deletion mice also exhibited impaired fear responses in the conditioned fear task. Here, we address whether oxytocin dysregulation is responsible for this impaired associative fear memory response. We show direct delivery of an oxytocin receptor antagonist to the central nervous system did not rescue the attenuated contextual or cued fear memory responses in Complete Deletion mice. Thus, increased oxytocin signaling is not acutely responsible for this phenotype. We also evaluated oxytocin receptor and serotonin transporter availability in regions related to fear learning, memory, and sociability using autoradiography in wild type and Complete Deletion mice. While we identified trends in lowered oxytocin receptor expression in the lateral septal nucleus, and trends towards lowered serotonin transporter availability in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, we found no significant differences after correction. Together, these data suggest the fear conditioning anomalies in the Williams Syndrome mouse model are independent of any alterations in the oxytocinergic system caused by deletion of the Williams locus.",886,73,171,18.0

Inter-organismal differences in daily rhythms, called chronotypes, exist and can shift with age. In ants, age, caste-related behavior and chronotype appear to be linked. “Around-the-clock” active nurse ants are usually younger and, with age, transition into rhythmically active foragers. Moreover, ants can shift between these behavioral castes depending on social context. We investigated how changes in daily gene expression could be contributing to such behavioral plasticity in Camponotus floridanus carpenter ants by combining time-course behavioral assays and RNA-Sequencing of forager and nurse brains.Results We found that nurse brains have three times fewer 24h oscillating genes than foragers. However, several hundred genes that oscillated every 24h in forager brains showed robust 8h oscillations in nurses, including the core clock genes Period and Shaggy. These differentially rhythmic genes consisted of several components of the circadian entrainment pathway, and showed enrichments for functions related to metabolism, cellular communication and protein modification. We additionally found that Vitellogenin, known to regulate division of labor in social insects, showed robust 24h oscillations in nurse brains but not in foragers. Furthermore, the protein products of several genes that were differentially expressed between the two ant castes were previously found in the trophallactic fluid of C. floridanus. This suggests a putative role for trophallaxis in regulating behavioral division of labor through caste-specific gene expression.Conclusion We provide a first look at the chronobiological differences in gene expression between forager and nurse ant brains. This endeavor allowed us to identify putative molecular mechanisms underlying plastic timekeeping. Several components of the ant circadian clock and its output can seemingly oscillate at different harmonics of the circadian rhythm. We propose that such chronobiological plasticity has evolved to allow for distinct regulatory networks that underlie behavioral castes, while supporting swift caste transitions in response to colony demands. Behavioral division of labor is common among social insects. The links between chronobiological and behavioral plasticity that we found in C. floridanus, thus, likely represent a more general phenomenon that warrants further investigation.",1360,126,327,69.0

For example, Eurasian jays have been found to employ a variety of cache protection strategies to minimise cache loss by responding to cues about the visual perspective or current desire of an observing conspecific. However, it is not known whether these jays (or any other corvid) can integrate multiple cues about different mental states and perform the optimal response accordingly. Across five experiments, we found little evidence that our Eurasian jays responded to either the visual perspective or current desire of another agent. In Experiments 1 and 2 we investigated whether Eurasian jays can limit the risk of cache loss by responding simultaneously to cues about the desire and perspective of a potential conspecific pilferer. Building on established paradigms, we used opaque and clear barriers to manipulate the observer’s visual access to cache locations, and specific satiety to manipulate the observer’s desire towards different types of food. Across both experiments the jays’ caching pattern provided no evidence that they could integrate information about the observer’s desire and perspective. Moreover, the results were also inconsistent with the previously reported effects that jays protect their caches by responding to either the visual access or specific satiety of the observer independently. To gain further insight into these unexpected results, we conducted three more experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, we attempted to replicate the previous finding that Eurasian jays prefer to cache behind an opaque barrier over a clear barrier when observed by a conspecific than when caching in private. In Experiment 5, we further investigated the previous finding that jays preferentially cache a type of food that had been eaten to satiety by a conspecific over a food that had not been eaten by the conspecific. Experiments 3, 4 and 5 found no significant effects in the direction of the previously reported effects, questioning their robustness. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for the field of corvid cognition and highlight several key issues that affect the reliability of comparative cognition research.",734,44,159,41.0

While observations of free-ranging animals are a crucial source of information, an experimental investigation that manipulates the size or composition, or both, of animal groups in captivity can also bring complementary contributions to the research inquiry. When paired with an automatic data collection by biologging technology, experimental studies on captive animals also allow for big data analyses based on recent machine learning techniques. As an initial exploration of this research paradigm, the present study inquired to what extent isolation of captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) changed their movement patterns. Using three-dimensional location trajectories of the macaques that were systematically collected via Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and a deep neural network, we estimated the identifiability of whether a macaque was behaving in isolation or in group. We found that the neural network identified the isolation vs. in-group conditions with more than 90% accuracy from a five-minute location trajectory, suggesting that the isolation caused notable changes from the canonical group-living behaviors. In addition, the isolation made each individual more identifiable from one another based on their location trajectories.",731,52,134,13.0

However, the extent of axon regeneration is highly variable and it is not known whether it is related to the level of behavioral recovery. To address this, we examined how swimming kinematics were related to axon regeneration by quantifying the relationship between swimming performance and percent axon regeneration of transected lampreys after 11 weeks of recovery. We found that swimming speed was not related to percent axon regeneration but it was closely related to body wave frequency and speed. However, wave frequency and speed varied greatly within individuals which resulted in swimming speed also varying within individuals. In fact, most recovered individuals, regardless of percent axon regeneration, could swim at fast and slow speeds. However, none of the transected individuals were able to generate body waves as large as the control lampreys. In order to swim faster, transected lampreys increased their wave frequencies and, as a result, transected lampreys had much higher frequencies than control lamprey at comparable swimming velocities. These data suggest that the control lampreys swam more efficiently than transected lampreys. In conclusion, there appears to be a minimal recovery threshold in terms of percent axon regeneration required for lampreys to be capable of swimming, however, there also seems to be a limit to how much they can behaviorally recover.",479,47,103,21.0

We challenge this interpretation because it is subject to a statistical fallacy, a form of attrition bias, and the observed behavior can be explained without invoking a sunk cost-dependent mechanism. Using a computational model, we illustrate how a rational decision maker with a reward-maximizing decision strategy reproduces the reported behavioral pattern and propose an improved task design to dissociate sunk costs from fluctuations in decision valuation.

Bukit Merah Orang Utan Island (BMOUI) is the only orangutan rehabilitation and conservation centre in the Malay Peninsula. We recorded and analyzed the activity budget and postural behaviours of orangutans moving freely in the enclosures on BMOUI to evaluate their welfare status. From December 2015 to December 2016, we observed three individuals: an adult male, an adult female and a subadult male, and collected 252 hours of focal data (84 hr/individual). The orangutans’ activity budget was dominated by resting (60%), feeding (13%), playing (14%) and moving (9%). The study individuals heavily relied on the artificial foods (79.2%), and they spent majority of their time on the ground (85.1%) with occasional arboreal observations like using the wooden tree platform or a rope. Despite some significant individual differences, behavioural categories followed a similar trend: resting &gt; feeding &gt; moving &gt; playing, except that the subadult male spent significantly more time playing (35%) than the two adults (3–4%). The most predominant posture was sitting (47.0%), followed by pronograde standing (29.4%), lying (10.5%) and clinging (4.5%). Our results suggest that orangutans on BMOUI engage in less feeding but more resting, and show less postural diversity, than free-ranging individuals. We propose that appropriate interventions to shift activity budgets, especially feeding vs. resting, and postural behaviours of captive orangutans towards those found in free-ranging orangutans might be beneficial for their welfare and survival; however, the conclusions we can draw are limited due to the small sample size, and thus until the captive behaviours of a larger number of orang-utans has been described, these results must be considered preliminary and just a case study.",1497,154,269,23.0

For example, we might ask whether the distribution of directions from which a stalking predator approaches its prey differs between sunny and cloudy conditions; or whether the time of day of mating attempts differs between lab mice subject to one of two hormone treatments. An array of statistical approaches to these questions have been developed. We compared 18 of these (by simulation) in terms of both abilities to control type I error rate near the nominal value, and statistical power. We found that only eight tests offered good control of type I error in all our test situations. Of these eight, we are able to identify Watson’s U2 test and MANOVA based on trigonometric functions of the data as offering the best power in the overwhelming majority of our test circumstances. There was often little to choose between these tests in terms of power, and no situation where either of the remaining six tests offered substantially better power than either of these. Hence, we recommend the routine use of either Watson’s U2 test or MANOVA when comparing two samples of circular data.",788,286,208,19.0

It is also one of the only regions in the adult mammalian brain that continues to generate new neurons throughout adulthood. This process of adult neurogenesis may increase the plasticity of the hippocampus which could be beneficial for learning but has also been demonstrated to decrease the stability of previously acquired memories. Here we test whether increased production of new neurons following the formation of a gradually acquired paired-associates task will result in forgetting of this type of memory. We trained mice in a touchscreen-based object/location task and then increased neurogenesis using voluntary exercise. Our results indicate that mice with increased neurogenesis show poor recall of the previously established memory. When subsequently exposed to a reversal task we also show that mice with increased neurogenesis require fewer correction trials to acquire the new task contingencies. This suggests that prior forgetting reduces perseveration on the now outdated memory. Together our results add to a growing body of literature which indicates the important role of adult neurogenesis in destabilizing previously acquired memories to allow for flexible encoding of new memories.,1445,104,359,20.0

The decision to dance is governed by rules that, when operating collectively, are assumed to direct foragers to the most profitable locations with little input from potential recruits, who are presumed to respond similarly to any dance regardless of its information content. Yet variation in receiver responses can qualitatively alter collective outcomes. Here, we use network-based diffusion analysis to compare the collective influence of dance information during recruitment to feeders at different distances. We further assess how any such effects might be achieved at the individual level by dance-followers either persisting with known sites when novel targets are distant and/or seeking more accurate spatial information to guide long-distance searches. Contrary to predictions, we found no evidence that dance-followers’ responses depended on target distance. While dance information was always key to feeder discovery, its importance did not vary with feeder distance, and bees were in fact quicker to abandon previously rewarding sites for distant alternatives. These findings provide empirical support for the longstanding assumption that self-organized foraging by honeybee colonies relies heavily on signal performance rules with limited input from recipients.",798,74,157,26.0

However, the amount of estragole released from the oil palm inflorescence is varied due to the influence of abiotic and biotic factors and is seen to have an impact on E. kamerunicus pollination activity on the oil palm. To evaluate the responses of E. kamerunicus, different types (wild and reared) and sex (male and female) of E. kamerunicus were exposed to different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150 and 200 ppm) of commercial estragole using four-arm olfactometer. Results showed that E. kamerunicus significantly preferred 100 ppm of estragole compared to other concentration (F = 139.81; d.f. = 9; P &lt; 0.05). A significant interaction was also recorded between estragole concentrations and sexes of E. kamerunicus (F = 3.91; d.f. = 9; P &lt; 0.05) where male E. kamerunicus was found to be more responsive to 100 ppm of estragole compared female E. kamerunicus. The E. kamerunicus responses to estragole is in line with the increase of estragole concentration up to 100 ppm. However, the response of E. kamerunicus was significantly decreased after the concentration value. The result of this study can be a good platform for future references since the estragole compound plays a significant role in oil palm’s flower pollination by E. kamerunicus.

We employ machine learning methods to extract data from the experimental recordings, and show that in the presence of an obstacle that blocks most of the path to the queen, the bees need more time but can still effectively employ the collective scenting strategy to overcome the obstacle and aggregate around the queen. Further, we increase the complexity of the environment by presenting the bees with a maze to navigate to the queen.

These foragers inhabit cluttered woodland habitat and feed on honeydew from aphids on trees, hence, the attraction to ‘tree-like’ objects might be an ecologically relevant behaviour that is tailored to the wood ants’ foraging ecology.

Tortoise hatchlings ignored familiar conspecifics, while they first explored and then actively avoided unfamiliar conspecifics. It remains to be established whether the different reactions to unfamiliar and familiar individuals in tortoise hatchlings are reactions to novelty, or whether they are specific to the interactions with living animals. To test this, we familiarized one-month-old tortoise hatchlings with an object (a brown cone vs. a blue sphere) and then tested them in a novel arena once with the familiar object and once with an unfamiliar one. To measure the reactions toward familiar and unfamiliar objects, we measured the distance between the tortoise and the object throughout the test. Differently from what happened with unfamiliar and familiar conspecifics, we found no difference in behavior toward familiar and unfamiliar objects. This shows that the different reactions toward familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics previously observed are specific for social interactions and are not a mere reaction to the novelty effect.

This showcases a behavioral expression of joint commitment to engage in this shared cultural practice. Moreover, we show that GHC initiators used various initiation strategies, attesting to situation-contingent interactional flexibility. We conclude that chimpanzees can be jointly committed to a cultural practice, which suggests that culture predicated on shared intentionality and flexible communication may not be unique to the human species.",1030,32,282,25.0

Animal social networks are typically drawn based on geometric proximity and/or frequency of social behaviors (e.g., grooming), but the appropriate metric for inter-individual relationship is not clear, especially when prior knowledge on the species/data is limited.In this study, researchers explored a non-parametric analysis of inter-individual relations using a neural network with the attention mechanism, which plays a central role in natural language processing. The high interpretability of the attention mechanism and flexibility of the entire neural network allow for automatic detection of inter-individual relations included in the raw data, without requiring prior knowledge/assumptions about what modes/types of relations are included in the data. For these case studies, three-dimensional location data collected from simulated agents and real Japanese macaques were analyzed.The proposed method successfully recovered the latent relations behind the simulated data and discovered female-oriented relations in the real data, which are in accordance with previous generalizations about the macaque social structure.The proposed method does not exploit any behavioral patterns that are particular to Japanese macaques, and researchers can use it for location data of other animals.

Temporal network data often consist in a succession of static networks over consecutive time windows whose length, however, is arbitrary, not necessarily corresponding to any intrinsic timescale of the system. Moreover, the resulting view of social network evolution is unsatisfactory: short time windows contain little information, whereas aggregating over large time windows blurs the dynamics. Going from a temporal network to a meaningful evolving representation of a social network therefore remains a challenge. Here we introduce a framework to that purpose: transforming temporal network data into an evolving weighted network where the weights of the links between individuals are updated at every interaction. Most importantly, this transformation takes into account the interdependence of social relationships due to the finite attention capacities of individuals: each interaction between two individuals not only reinforces their mutual relationship but also weakens their relationships with others. We study a concrete example of such a transformation and apply it to several data sets of social interactions. Using temporal contact data collected in schools, we show how our framework highlights specificities in their structure and temporal organization. We then introduce a synthetic perturbation into a data set of interactions in a group of baboons to show that it is possible to detect a perturbation in a social group on a wide range of timescales and parameters. Our framework brings new perspectives to the analysis of temporal social networks.",1063,50,166,18.0

Detection of cryptic predators, such as crab spiders, by flower seeking wasps may also be hindered by wind induced movement of the flowers themselves. In a beach dune habitat, Microbembex nigrifrons wasps approaching flowerheads of the Palafoxia lindenii plant need to evaluate the flowers to avoid spider attack. Wasps may detect spiders through colour and movement cues. We tracked the flight trajectories of dune wasps as they approached occupied and unoccupied flowers under two movement conditions; when the flowers were still or moving. We simulated the appearance of the spider and the flower using psychophysical visual modelling techniques and related it to the decisions made by the wasp to land or avoid the flower. Wasps could discriminate spiders only at a very close range, and this was reflected in the shape of their trajectories. Wasps were more prone to making errors in threat assessment when the flowers are moving. Our results suggest that dune wasp predation risk is augmented by abiotic conditions such as wind and compromises their early detection capabilities.",1040,97,180,28.0

We examined these in an old-world passerine, Purple Sunbird. First, we identified and acoustically characterised the repertoire size (of notes and phrases). We then assessed positional fidelity and ordering of notes within phrases. We found 23 distinct notes by aural-visual inspection of spectrograms which was validated using a Classification and Regression Tree based on 5 acoustic parameters. These notes combined in different iterations to form 30 different phrases. Phrases comprised of an overall structure with an introductory note (prefix) at the onset, followed by notes occurring at specific positions within the phrase body, and terminated with a trill (suffix syllable(s)). Prefix was present in 93% of phrases whereas suffix syllable(s) occurred in 27% of phrases only. We found that notes exhibited positional fidelity and combined in specific order to form a phrase. This is indicative of underlying phonological syntax that limits the ways in which notes combine to form phrase and offers insights to song complexity. Finally, we found that suffix syllables exhibit the presence of mini-breath (very short inter-note interval) which are known to be produced by CVM.",1095,56,132,22.0

Earlier studies suggested that non-breeders belong to distinct castes that specialise permanently or temporarily on specific cooperative tasks. In contrast, recent research on naked mole-rats has shown that behavioural phenotypes are continuously distributed across non-breeders and that mole-rats exhibit considerable behavioural plasticity suggesting that individuals may not specialise permanently on work tasks. However, it is currently unclear whether individuals specialise temporarily and whether there is a sex bias in cooperative behaviour among non-breeders. Here we show that non-breeding individuals vary in overall cooperative investment, but do not specialise on specific work tasks. Within individuals, investment into specific cooperative tasks such as nest building, food carrying and burrowing are positively correlated, and there is no evidence that individuals show trade-offs between these cooperative behaviours. Non-breeding males and females do not differ in their investment in cooperative behaviours and show broadly similar age and body mass related differences in cooperative behaviours. Our results suggest that non-breeding naked mole-rats vary in their overall contribution to cooperative behaviours and that some of this variation may be explained by differences in age and body mass. Our data provide no evidence for temporary specialisation, as found among some eusocial insects, and suggests that the behavioural organisation of naked mole-rats resembles that of other cooperatively breeding vertebrates more than that of eusocial insect species.",1047,70,193,31.0

We analyze the kinematics and inter-leg coordination of freely walking tardigrades (species: Hypsibius dujardini). We find that tardigrade walking replicates several key features of walking in insects despite disparities in size, skeleton, and habitat. To test the effect of environmental changes on tardigrade locomotor control circuits, we measure kinematics and inter-leg coordination during walking on two substrates of different stiffnesses. We find that the phase offset between contralateral leg pairs is flexible, while ipsilateral coordination is preserved across environmental conditions. This mirrors similar results in insects and crustaceans. We propose that these functional similarities in walking co-ordination between tardigrades and arthropods is either due to a generalized locomotor control circuit common to panarthropods, or to independent convergence onto an optimal strategy for robust multi-legged control in small animals with simple circuitry. Our results highlight the value of tardigrades as a comparative system towards understanding the mechanisms – neural and/or mechanical – underlying coordination in panarthropod locomotion.",10544,263,917,15.0

To test whether floral humidity can be used by other more widespread generalist pollinators, we designed artificial flowers that presented biologically-relevant levels of humidity similar to those shown by flowering plants. Bumblebees showed a spontaneous preference for flowers which produced higher floral humidity. Furthermore, learning experiments showed that bumblebees are able to use differences in floral humidity to distinguish between rewarding and nonrewarding flowers. Our results indicate that bumblebees are sensitive to different levels of floral humidity. In this way floral humidity can add to the information provided by flowers and could impact pollinator behaviour more significantly than previously thought.Summary statement We demonstrate for the first time that bumblebees show a preference to elevated floral humidity and can learn to distinguish flowers that differ in floral humidity levels.",912,73,325,33.0

We have developed a comprehensive battery of tests to characterize the behavior and physiological function of the Yucatan minipig throughout maturation. Behavioral testing included assessments of learning and memory, executive functions, circadian rhythms, gait analysis, and level of motor activity. We applied traditional behavioral apparatus and analysis methods, as well as state-of-the-art sensor technologies to report on motion and activity, and artificial intelligent approaches to analyze behavior.

Bees’ mite-biting behavior has been selected as a Varroa-tolerant or Varroa-resistant trait in the state of Indiana for more than a decade. A survey of damaged mites from the bottom of a colony can be used as an extended phenotype to evaluate the mite-biting behavior of a colony. In this study, on average, 37% of mites sampled from the breeding stocks of 59 colonies of mite biters in Indiana were damaged or mutilated, which is significantly higher than the 19% of damaged mites found in commercial colonies in the southern United States. Indiana mite biter colonies had a higher proportion of damaged mites, although among the damaged mites, the number of missing legs was not significantly higher. In addition, the morphology of pollen-forager worker bee mandibles was compared by X-ray microcomputed tomography for six parameters in two populations, and a difference was detected in one parameter.

Birds and mammals combine diverse sounds into complex sequences to communicate, but these sequences largely remain understudied in other taxa. Anuran vocalizations are a prominent feature of their life history, and function in defense of territories and to attract mates. However, despite the spectacular diversity of anurans in tropical regions of the world, vocal diversity and communication strategies remain relatively poorly studied. Specifically, studies of vocal sequences and context-dependent vocal patterns in frogs remain few. Here, we investigated the context-dependent vocal repertoire and the use of vocal sequences by two anuran species belonging to different lineages, both endemic to the hyper-diverse Western Ghats of India. By recording vocal sequences both when frogs were alone and in the presence of a territorial rival, we present evidence that both species modify their vocal repertoire according to context. Specifically, one species appends notes to generate more complex sequences, whereas the other shifts to different note types, resulting in different sequences for different contexts. Thus, despite differences in repertoire size, both frog species are capable of adjusting the temporal sequence of vocalizations to communicate in different contexts. This study highlights the need for further studies of insular frogs, to understand how diversification across these continental islands has influenced the evolution of vocal repertoires, vocal sequence patterns and communication systems.Lay Summary Animals employ complex sequences of acoustic signals to communicate in diverse behavioral contexts. Here, we demonstrate that two frog species with different vocal repertoires both modify the sequence of note emissions in the presence of a territorial rival. These patterns demonstrate that anurans are capable of complex shifts in the patterns of their vocalization, to communicate different messages to different receivers.

Although previous pre-clinical studies found effects of early life stress on cognition and stress hormone reactivity, these studies largely focused on males. The purpose of the current study was to determine how biological sex shapes behavioral coping and metabolic health across the lifespan after chronic stress. We hypothesized that examining chronic stress-induced behavioral and endocrine outcomes would reveal sex differences in the biological basis of susceptibility. During the late adolescent period, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats experienced chronic variable stress (CVS). Following completion of CVS, all rats experienced a forced swim test (FST) followed 3 days later by a fasted glucose tolerance test (GTT). The FST was used to determine coping in response to a stressor. Endocrine metabolic function was evaluated in the GTT by measuring glucose and corticosterone, the primary rodent glucocorticoid. Animals then aged to 15 months when the FST and GTT were repeated. In young animals, chronically stressed females exhibited more passive coping and corticosterone release in the FST. Additionally, chronically stressed females had elevated corticosterone and impaired glucose clearance in the GTT. Aging affected all measurements as behavioral and endocrine outcomes were sex specific. Furthermore, regression analysis between hormonal and behavioral responses identified associations depending on sex and stress. Collectively, these data indicate female susceptibility to the effects of chronic stress during adolescence. Further, translational investigation of coping style and glucose homeostasis may identify biomarkers for stress-related disorders.",682,49,97,42.0

We hypothesized that if dogs’ social skills for cooperating with humans are biologically prepared, then these skills should emerge robustly in early development, not require extensive socialization or learning, and exhibit heritable variation. Puppies were highly skillful at using diverse human gestures and we found no evidence of learning across test trials, suggesting that they possess these skills prior to their first exposure to these cues.

This phenomenon may involve general drives, e.g. for social touch or companionship, as well as drives that are specific to particular peers, and which ultimately serve to reestablish relationships between the individuals. Female degus are known to be affiliative with multiple other individuals, including unrelated and unfamiliar conspecifics, offering an opportunity to study social motivation independent from exclusive pair-bonds or overt, same-sex competition. We attempted to disentangle factors driving peer interaction by examining reunion behavior across several social isolation and separation manipulations. High levels of interaction were observed between adult females who had been separated even without isolation, revealing a drive to re-establish relationships with specific peers. The content of separation-only reunions differed from isolation, with the latter involving more early-session interaction, higher levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing, and a higher ratio of chitter vocalizations. To assess whether post-isolation behavior was related to stress, we examined reunions following a non-social (footshock) stressor. Like isolation, footshock increased early-session interactions, but did not increase allogrooming before rear-sniffing or chittering, as compared with controls. To test whether separation-only reunion behavior shared qualities with relationship formation, we also examined reunions of new (stranger) dyads. Strangers exhibited higher levels of interaction than cagemates, with particularly high levels of late-session rear-sniffing. Like separation-only reunions, strangers showed more non-chitter vocalizations and lower levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing. Across experiments, an exploratory clustering method was used to identify vocalizations that differed between conditions. This yielded promising leads for future investigation, including a chaff-type syllable that may have been more common during relationship renewal. Overall, results are consistent with the hypothesis that female degu reunions are supported by both general and peer-stimulus specific drives, expressed through the structure of physical and vocal interactions over time.",1573,196,353,52.0

Here, we simulate performance on a multi-arm bandit task to examine the consequences of a confirmatory bias for reward harvesting. We report a paradoxical finding: that confirmatory biases allow the agent to maximise reward relative to an unbiased updating rule. This principle holds over a wide range of experimental settings and is most influential when decisions are corrupted by noise. We show that this occurs because on average, confirmatory biases lead to overestimating the value of more valuable bandits, and underestimating the value of less valuable bandits, rendering decisions overall more robust in the face of noise. Our results show how apparently suboptimal learning policies can in fact be reward-maximising if decisions are made with finite computational precision.",2303,303,629,24.0

We devised a single-interval task where observers discriminated the slant of a densely textured planar test surface relative to a textured planar surround reference surface. Although surfaces were rendered with correct perspective, the stimuli were designed so that the binocular cues dominated performance. Slant discrimination performance was measured as a function of the reference slant and the level of uncorrelated white noise added to the test-plane images in the left and right eye. We compared human performance with an approximate ideal observer (planar cross correlation, PCC) and two sub-ideal observers. The PCC observer uses the image in one eye and back projection to predict the test image in the other eye for all possible slants, tilts, and distances. The estimated slant, tilt, and distance are determined by the prediction that most closely matches the measured image in the other eye. The first sub-ideal observer (local PCC, LPCC) applies planar cross correlation over local neighborhoods and then pools estimates across the test plane. The second sub-optimal observer (standard cross correlation, SCC), uses only positional disparity information. We find that the ideal observer (PCC) and the first sub-ideal observer (LPCC) outperform the second sub-ideal observer (SCC), demonstrating the benefits of structural disparities. We also find that all three model observers can account for human performance, if two free parameters are included: a fixed small level of internal estimation noise, and a fixed overall efficiency scalar on slant discriminability.Precis We measured human stereo slant discrimination thresholds for accurately-rendered textured surfaces designed so that performance is dominated by binocular-disparity cues.

While many studies have replicated the effect, there has been little variation in the structure of the reasoning problems used in those studies. In particular, most experiments have used extremely low base rates, high hit rates, and low false alarm rates. As a result, it is unclear whether the effect is a general phenomenon in human probabilistic reasoning or an anomaly that applies only to a small subset of reasoning problems. Moreover, previous studies have focused on describing empirical patterns of the effect and not so much on the underlying strategies. Here, we address these limitations by testing participants on a broader problem space and modelling their response at a single-participant level. We find that the empirical patterns that have served as evidence for base-rate neglect generalize to the larger problem space. At the level of individuals, we find evidence for large variability in how sensitive participants are to base rates, but with two distinct groups: those who largely ignore base rates and those who almost perfectly account for it. This heterogeneity is reflected in the cognitive modeling results, which reveal that there is not a single strategy that best captures the data for all participants. The overall best model is a variant of the Bayesian model with too conservative priors, tightly followed by a linear-additive integration model. Surprisingly, we find very little evidence for earlier proposed heuristic models. Altogether, our results suggest that the effect known as “base-rate neglect” generalizes to a large set of reasoning problems, but may need a reinterpretation in terms of the underlying cognitive mechanisms.",1137,115,200,45.0

Here, we combine data from human participants and artificial agents to examine how confirmation-biased learning might improve performance by counteracting decisional and environmental noise. We evaluate one potential mechanism for such noise reduction: visual attention—a demonstrated driver of both value-based choice and predictive learning. Surprisingly, visual attention showed the opposite pattern to confirmation bias, as participants were most likely to fixate on “missed opportunities”, slightly dampening the effects of the confirmation bias we observed.

This behavioural flexibility often involves choosing between multiple potential actions. However, little is known about how a single action can be used to achieve strategically distinct functions. Here we show that the omnivorous nematode, Pristionchus pacificus, optimizes its mixed-resource diet by prioritizing either predatory or territorial outcomes of biting the bacterivorous nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. To determine biting incentive, P. pacificus assesses success probabilities and net energetic gains of treating C. elegans as prey, and alternatively as a competitor for bacterial food. Considering both predatory and territorial biting outcomes enables P. pacificus to pivot to territorial aggression when predation is difficult. In addition to using these outcomes to valuate biting incentive, P. pacificus designates the more lucrative outcome as its objective for biting. This biting subgoal then recruits a search subgoal that specifically promotes predatory or territorial biting, thereby unifying behaviour towards a singular foraging strategy. Furthermore, we identified the invertebrate norepinephrine analogue, octopamine, as critical for switching between predatory and territorial strategies. Collectively, our results demonstrate that behavioural flexibility on the single-action level is achieved by a hierarchy of goals and subgoals that valuate and choose from various outcome choices.",1066,101,311,56.0

Small-brained animals such as insects might rely even more on sequential acquisition of pattern features since there might be less parallel processing capacity in their brains than in vertebrates. To investigate how active vision strategies enable bees to solve visual tasks, here, we employed a simple visual discrimination task in which individual bees were presented with a multiplication symbol and a 45° rotated version of the same pattern (“plus sign”). High-speed videography of unrewarded tests and analysis of the bees’ flight paths shows that only a small region of the pattern is inspected before successfully accepting a target or rejecting a distractor. The bees’ scanning behaviour of the stimuli differed for plus signs and multiplication signs, but for each of these, the flight behaviour was consistent irrespective of whether the pattern was rewarding or unrewarding. Bees typically oriented themselves at ~±30° to the patterns such that only one eye had an unobscured view of stimuli. There was a significant preference for initially scanning the left side of the stimuli. Our results suggest that the bees’ movement may be an integral part of a strategy to efficiently analyse and encode their environment.Summary statement Automated video tracking and flight analysis is proposed as the next milestone in understanding mechanisms underpinning active vision and cognitive visual abilities of bees.",1300,65,381,25.0

Literature shows that conspecifics might enjoy their everyday chat, without ever worrying about occasional eavesdroppers (e.g., predators), when information interchange evolves into a private communication channel. Yet, when signalling is converted into foraging cues by predators, their prey must pay the due cost for sustaining conversation. For that matter, fiddler crabs draw attention for having flashy enlarged claws that could potentially attract the attention of many predators. Surprisingly, the costs associated with claw colouration in fiddler crabs are still poorly understood and have never been studied in American species. Here, we initially examine whether hypertrophied claws of American thin-fingered fiddler crabs (Leptuca leptodactyla) reflect UV-light and how conspecific females react to these cues. Then we test two alternative hypotheses concerning the role of claw colouration in fiddler crabs’ mate choice: a) that claw colouration evolved into a private communication channel, which could have significantly lowered signalling costs for males; b) that claw colouration is conspicuous to potential reproductive partners, as well as to predators, making colour signalling by males very costly (i.e., a handicap). Thereafter, we measured the reflectance spectra from several enlarged claws and modelled their chromatic contrast against the background spectrum, considering the visual systems of conspecific fiddler crabs and two kinds of predators (terns and plovers). We also tested female conspecifics’ preference towards enlarged claws that reflected UV-light or other colour cues, by artificially altering claw colouration. Our results show a clear female preference for UV reflecting males. We also found that natural enlarged claws should be highly detectable by avian predators, refuting the private communication channel hypothesis. Furthermore, since female fiddler crabs select the most flamboyant claws from the sandy background, claw colouration in fiddler crabs can be understood as an honest signal.HIGHLIGHTSThe hypertrophied claws of male Leptuca leptodactyla reflect UV light.Female fiddler crabs display a natural preference for UV light cues.Conspicuous claws function as handicaps and may honestly signal individual quality.Male enlarged claws are more conspicuous to birds than to crabs.Our data refute the presence of a private communication channel in L. leptodactyla.",913,83,187,26.0

While vocal learning is common in taxa such as songbirds and whales, the vocal learning capacities of nonhuman primates appear more limited. Intriguingly, evidence for vocal learning has been reported in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for example in the form of regional variation (‘dialects’) in the ‘pant-hoot’ calls. This suggests that some capacity for vocal learning may be an ancient feature of the Pan-Homo clade. Nonetheless, reported differences have been subtle, with inter-community variation representing only a small portion of the total acoustic variation. To gain further insights into the extent of regional variation in chimpanzee vocalizations, we performed an analysis of pant-hoots from chimpanzees in the neighboring Kasekela and Mitumba communities at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, and the geographically distant Kanyawara community at Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed group differences only among the geographically isolated communities and did not find any differences between the neighboring communities at Gombe. Furthermore, we found differences among individuals in all communities. Hence, the variation in chimpanzee pant-hoots reflected individual differences, rather than group differences.

Here we present a study that investigates to what extent animals rely on integrative rules (using the full information) versus non-compensatory rules when choosing where to forage. Groups of mice were trained to obtain water from dispensers varying along two reward dimensions: volume and probability. The mice’s choices over the course of the experiment suggested an initial reliance on integrative rules, later displaced by a sequential rule, in which volume was evaluated before probability.

While the precise mechanisms behind the development of handedness are still widely debated, empirical evidences highlight that besides genetic factors, environmental factors may play a crucial role. As one of these factors, maternal cradling behavior may play a key role in the emergence of early handedness in the offspring. In the present study we followed 41 olive baboon (Papio anubis) infants living in different social groups with their mother for which direction (e.g., left- or right-arm) and degree of maternal cradling-side bias were available from our previous published study. We assessed hand preferences for an unimanual grasping task at 3 developmental stages: (1) 0-4, (2) 4-6 and (3) 9-10 months of age. We found that individual hand preferences for grasping exist as soon as the first months of age, with a population-level left-handedness predominance, being stable until 6 months; to wit the period during which juveniles are mainly carried by their mothers. More importantly, this early postnatal handedness is positively correlated with maternal cradling lateralization. Interestingly, hand preferences assessed later in the development, once juveniles are no longer carried (i.e., from 9 to 10 months of age), are less consistent with the earlier developmental stages and no longer dependent from the maternal cradling bias. Our findings suggest that the ontogenetic dynamics of the infant’s hand preference and its changes might ultimately rely on the degree of infant dependence from the mother across development.Research HighlightsEarly postnatal individual hand preferences are detected for unimanual food grasping within the first four months of age.Earliest measures of infant hand preference are positively correlated with measures of maternal cradling lateralization.Hand preferences assessed later in the development, from 9 to 10 months of age are less consistent with the earlier developmental stages and independent from maternal cradling bias.",819,30,118,25.0

RCCs to date were generated in mice, but rats are thought to be optimal for addiction genetic studies. Based on past literature, one inbred Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat substrain, SHR/NCrl, is predicted to exhibit a distinct behavioral profile as it relates to cocaine vulnerability traits relative to another substrain, SHR/NHsd. Direct substrain comparisons are a necessary first step before implementing an RCC. We evaluated a number of premorbid addiction vulnerability traits and cocaine self-administration behaviors using a longitudinal within-subjects design. Trait impulsivity and compulsivity were greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd, as were reactivity to sucrose reward, sensitivity to acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, and cocaine abuse liability studied under fixed-ratio and chained schedules of cocaine self-administration. Trait compulsivity correlated with the acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, which in turn correlated with cocaine taking under the chained schedule. Trait compulsivity also was the best predictor of cocaine seeking responses. Heritability estimates indicated that 22%-40% of the variances for the above phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors, providing sufficient genetic variance to conduct genetic mapping in F2 crosses of SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd.

KS-1 consists of a frame for mounting flexibly on housing cages, a touchscreen animal interface with mounts for receptables, reward pumps and cameras, and a compact computer cabinet with an interface for controlling behavior. Behavioral control is achieved with a unity3D program that is virtual-reality capable, allowing semi-naturalistic visual tasks to assess multiple cognitive domains.Results KS-1 is fully integrated into the regular housing routines of monkeys. A single person can operate multiple KS-1s.

However, leader and follower roles are difficult to disentangle in species with high levels of coordination. To overcome this challenge, we investigated a simple case of movement coordination: termite pairs in which a female leads a male as they search for a nest site. To tease apart leader and follower roles, we created conspecific and heterospecific pairs of Coptotermes gestroi and C. formosanus, which share a pairing pheromone so that males follow females of either species. Conspecific pairs were stable for both species, even though C. gestroi females produce less pheromone than C. formosanus. Heterospecific pairs with C. gestroi males were also stable, but not those with C. formosanus males. We attributed this difference to the C. gestroi male’s unique capacity to follow females that release small amounts of pheromone; C. formosanus males cannot follow or reject C. gestroi females as unsuitable. This conclusion was supported by an information-theoretic analysis that detected information flow from C. formosanus females to C. gestroi males as in conspecific pairs, but not from C. gestroi females to C. formosanus males. Despite their following ability, C. gestroi males lost to C. formosanus males in competitions to follow C. formosanus females. Thus, partner selection has shaped the species-specific association of mating pairs.

We analyze how mutations in genes known to affect social behavior of humans perturb these simple reflexes in larval zebrafish and thereby affect their collective behaviors.

Research has shown that both biological (genes) and environmental (stress) precursors are linked to opioid use. In particular, stress during adolescence – a critical period of frontal lobe development – influences the likelihood of abusing drugs. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms through which adolescent stress leads to long-term risk of opioid use, or whether genetic background moderates this response. Male and female C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice were exposed to chronic variable social stress (CVSS) or control conditions throughout adolescence and then tested for morphine locomotor sensitization or morphine consumption in adulthood. To examine possible mechanisms that underlie stress-induced changes in morphine behaviors, we assessed physiological changes in response to acute stress exposure and prefrontal cortex miRNA gene expression. Adolescent stress did not influence morphine sensitization or consumption in BALB/cJ animals, and there was limited evidence of stress effects in female C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, male C57BL/6J mice exposed to adolescent CVSS had blunted morphine sensitization compared to control animals; no differences were observed in the acute locomotor response to morphine administration or morphine consumption. Physiologically, C57BL/6J mice exposed to CVSS had an attenuated corticosterone recovery following an acute stressor and downregulation of twelve miRNA in the prefrontal cortex compared to control mice. The specificity of the effects for C57BL/6J versus BALB/cJ mice provides evidence of a gene by environmental interaction influencing opioid behaviors.

Fish showed group size preference from 26 days post fertilization (dpf) and from 27 dpf fish reliably chose the larger group when presented with discrimination ratios from 1:8 to 2:3. When the ratio between the number of conspecifics in each group was maintained at 1:2, fish could discriminate between 1 vs. 2 individuals and 3 vs. 6, but not when given a choice between 2 vs. 4 individuals. These findings suggest that the systems involved in numerosity representation in fish do not operate separately from other cognitive mechanisms. Rather they suggest numerosity processing is the result of an interplay between attentional, cognitive and memory-related mechanisms that orchestrate numerical competence both in humans and animals.

Tracking behavior features zig-zagging paths with animals often staying in close contact with the trail. Upon sustained loss of contact, animals execute a characteristic sequence of sweeping “casts” – wide oscillations with increasing amplitude. Here, we provide a unified description of trail-tracking behavior by introducing an optimization framework where animals search in the angular sector defined by their estimate of the trail’s heading and its uncertainty. In silico experiments using reinforcement learning based on this hypothesis recapitulate experimentally observed tracking patterns. We show that search geometry imposes limits on the tracking speed, and quantify its dependence on trail statistics and memory of past contacts. By formulating trail-tracking as a Bellman-type sequential optimization problem, we quantify the basic geometric elements of optimal sector search strategy, effectively explaining why and when casting is necessary. We propose a set of experiments to infer how tracking animals acquire, integrate and respond to past information on the tracked trail. More generally, we define navigational strategies relevant for animals and bio-mimetic robots, and formulate trail-tracking as a novel behavioral paradigm for learning, memory and planning.",1411,66,603,36.0

However, this hypothesis has been challenged by the presence of other non-numerical continuous physical variables, that vary along with numerosity (e.g. any change in the number of visual physical elements in a set naturally involves a related change in visual features such as area, density, contour length and convex hull of the stimulus). It is therefore necessary to control and manipulate the continuous physical information when investigating the ability of humans and other animals to perceive numerousness. During decades of research, different methods have been implemented in order to address this issue, which has implications for experiments replicability and inter-species comparisons, since no general standardized procedure is currently being used. Here we present the “Generation of Numerical Elements Images Software” (GeNEsIS) for the creation of non-symbolic numerical arrays in a standardized and user-friendly environment.

Habitat selection, movement, and sociality are highly flexible behaviors that influence the mortality risks and subsequent fitness of individuals. In the Anthropocene, animals are experiencing increased risks from direct human causes and increased spread of infectious diseases. Using integrated step selection analysis, we tested how the habitat selection, movement, and social behaviors of grey wolves vary as an individual dies due to humans or canine distemper virus (CDV) and how those behaviors may vary in the lead up to death. Behaviors that changed prior to death were strongly related to how an animal eventually died. Wolves killed by humans moved slower than wolves that survived and selected to be nearer roads closer in time to their death. Wolves that died due to CDV moved progressively slower as they neared death and reduced their avoidance of wet habitats. All animals, regardless of dying or not maintained strong selection to be near packmates across time, which seemingly contributed to disease dynamics in the packs that became infected with CDV. Habitat selection, movement, and sociality interact to put individuals and groups at greater risks, influencing their cause-specific mortality.Lay Summary Not much is known about behaviors prior to death in wild animals. Grey wolves killed by humans selected to be in riskier areas increasingly prior to their deaths. Wolves that died due to disease moved slower and changed their habitat selection to be in areas with more water as they became sicker. Sick wolves also continued to select for packmates, increasing the chances that the whole pack would succumb to the disease.",522,55,152,26.0

Currently, however, little is known about the biological responses of individuals to experiencing cooperation. Here, we quantify the neuroregulatory response of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) experiencing cooperation or defection by examining the transcriptional response of the oxytocin gene (oxt; also known as isotocin), which has been implicated in cooperative decision-making. We exposed wild-caught females to social environments where partners either cooperated or defected during predator inspection, or to a control (non-predator inspection) context, and quantified the relative transcription of the oxt gene. We tested an experimental group, originating from a site where individuals are under high predation threat and have previous experience of large aquatic predators (HP), and a control group, where individuals are under low predation threat and naïve to large aquatic predators (LP). In HP, but not LP, fish brain mid-section oxt relative transcription varied depending on social partner behaviour. HP fish experiencing cooperation during predator inspection had lower oxt transcription than those experiencing defection. This effect was not present in the control population or in the control context, where the behaviour of social partners did not affect oxt transcription. Our findings provide insight into the neuromodulation underpinning behavioural responses to social experiences, and ultimately to the proximate mechanisms underlying social decision-making.",427,209,124,24.0

One important factor shaping sociality is group stability. To maintain group cohesion and stability, bats often rely on social vocal communication. The Honduran white bat, Ectophylla alba exhibits an unusual social structure compared to other tent-roosting species. This small white-furred bat lives in perennial stable mixed-sex groups. Tent construction requires several individuals and, as the only tent roosting species so far, involves both sexes. The bats’ social system and ecology render this species an interesting candidate to study social behaviour and social vocal communication. In our study, we investigated the social behaviour and vocalizations of E. alba in the tent by observing two stable groups, including pups, in the wild. We documented 16 different behaviours, among others, play and fur chewing, a behaviour presumably used for scent-marking. Moreover, we found 10 distinct social call types in addition to echolocation calls, and, for seven call types, we were able to identify the corresponding behavioural context. Most of the social call types were affiliative, including two types of contact calls, maternal directives, pup isolation calls and a call type related to the fur-chewing behaviour.

In dynamic social environments, multiple individuals may play a pivotal role in any given interaction where a male’s attention may be divided between a rival, a current mate, and/or future potential mates. Here, we investigated impacts of the social environment on attention allocation in male sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna, which are a part of a sexual-unisexual mating system with the Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa. We asked: 1) Does the species of female influence the amount of attention a male allocates to her? And 2) Is a male’s attention towards his mate influenced by different social partners? Males direct more attention toward a stimulus female when she was a conspecific. We also show that males perceive a larger male as a more relevant stimulus to pay attention to than a smaller male, and a conspecific female as a more relevant stimulus compared to a heterospecific female. Our results show differential allocation of attention is dependent upon multiple components of the social environment in which an individual interacts.Significance This study investigates how attention is allocated in males when presented with social distractions. Assuming that attentional capacity is finite, males may face a tradeoff between different cognitive-demanding stimuli, such as rival males and potential future mates, when mating. Here, we show that male attention allocation in both intra- and intersexual interactions is multifaceted and context dependent. This suggests that individuals within the social environment vary in how meaningful (i.e., able to capture attention) they are to males during mating encounters. Understanding how social partners can cause a shift of attention away from a mating opportunity is essential to understanding the influence of the social context on sexual selection.",307,49,64,20.0

Furthermore, we tested the system on starlings (Sturnidae vulgaris).The ability to include other sensors is retained in our prototypes, allowing for the potential integration of physiological and behavioural inference into social networks derived from our approach.

We compiled a database of 409 published cases across 50 different primate species of mothers’ responses to their infants’ deaths to test hypotheses proposed to explain between- and within-species variation in corpse carrying. Using Bayesian phylogenetic regressions, we preliminarily identified three factors as possible predictors of ICC occurrence. However, using an information-theoretic approach, no combination of these predictors performed better than the null model, offering no support for any of the hypotheses we tested. In contrast, for those cases where infants’ corpses were carried, infant age affected ICC duration, with longer ICC observed for younger infants. This result may provide support for hypotheses that suggest that ICC is a by-product of a strong mother-infant bond.

We examined the location and number of caches made by two corvid species differing in sociality, highly social pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) and less social Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). Although pinyon jays cached a similar amount of food across conditions, they allocated more caches to areas less accessible to the observer when the observer spent more time close to the caching locations. Nutcrackers, however, reduced the number of seeds cached when observed by another nutcracker in comparison to when they cached alone, but did not significantly change their caching behaviour when observed by a pinyon jay. The differences in cache protection strategies, and the social cues (e.g., presence and behaviour of an observing bird) that elicit them, may be explained by the species’ social organisation.

Meanwhile, administration of D1-R antagonist disrupted the social interaction which led to the deficits of color preference. More importantly, the altered microbiota caused by an antibiotic OTC decreased the sociability and weakened shoals’ color preference. When given a supplement of LGG after OTC exposure, fish exhibited an unexpectedly recovery capability in social cohesion and color preference.

We tested this hypothesis by exposing genetically identical Amazon mollies to social partners of different genotypes, and then moving these individuals to new social groups in which they were the only member to have experienced the IGE. We found that the differences in aggression experienced in genetically different social environments carried over into new social groups to influence the exploratory behaviors of individuals that did not directly experience the previous social environments. Our data reveal that IGE can propagate beyond the individuals that directly experience them in Amazon mollies and possibly in many group-living species.

However, when learning conditions are not optimal (e.g., when training is massed), credit assignment is no longer competitive. This is a catastrophic failure of the learning system that exposes the individual’s vulnerability to form spurious associations in the real world.

We provided two groups of vervet monkeys with a novel food, unshelled peanuts, and documented how three different peanut opening techniques spread within the groups. We analysed data using hierarchical Bayesian dynamic learning models that explore the integration of multiple SLS with individual learning. We i) report evidence of social learning compared to strictly individual learning, ii) show that vervets preferentially socially learn the technique that yields the highest observed payoff and iii) also bias attention toward individuals of higher rank. This shows that behavioural preferences can arise when individuals integrate social information about the efficiency of a behaviour alongside cues related to the rank of a demonstrator.

The Bengalese finch has complex songs, lower fear response, and lower corticosterone levels than those in the white-rumped munia. We hypothesized that domesticated finches increase the effort to reproduce in lieu of maintaining fitness for survival as needed in the wild.

Therefore, we compared the aggressiveness and biting force of white-rumped munias with those of Bengalese finches to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of behavioural changes due to domestication.

Nocturnal insects such as crickets use mechanosensory inputs mediated by their antennae to navigate under dark conditions. Active sensing with voluntary antennal movements improves spatial information, but it remains unclear how accurately the insects can perceive the surrounding space by using their antennal system. Crickets exhibit escape behavior in response to a short air-puff, which is detected by the abdominal mechanosensory organ called cerci and is perceived as a “predator approach” signal. We placed objects of different shapes at different locations with which the cricket actively made contact using its antenna. We then examined the effects on wind-elicited escape. The crickets changed their movement trajectory depending on the shape and location of the objects so that they could avoid collision with these obstacles even when the escape behavior was triggered by another modality of stimulus. For instance, when a wall was placed in front of the crickets so that it was detected by one side of their antenna, the escape trajectory in response to a stimulus from behind was significantly biased toward the side opposite the wall. However, if the antenna on the free side without the wall was ablated, this modulation to avoid collision diminished, suggesting that the antenna on the free side provided information of “absence” of obstacles. This study demonstrated that crickets were able to perceive spatial information, including the presence or absence of objects by active sensing with their antennal system.Summary Statement Crickets can acquire spatial information such as shape, location and orientation of objects through active sensing by antennal mechanosensory system, which also provides information about the absence of objects.",339,46,128,41.0

These stimuli are designed to preserve movement patterns while minimizing static detail, with single dots representing each of the main joints of a moving animal. Imposed by their internal skeleton, vertebrate movements follow a specific semi-rigid dynamic pattern, termed “biological-motion”, which can be used to distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Although biological motion detection has not been studied in invertebrates, rigid exoskeletons force many species to also follow semi-rigid movement principles. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex visual behaviors, we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from non-biological motion using point-light display stimuli. By constraining spiders so that they could rotate but not move directionally, we simultaneously presented two point-light display stimuli with specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing which pattern they turned towards. Jumping spiders clearly demonstrated the ability to discriminate between stimuli. However, spiders showed no preference when both stimuli presented patterns with semi-rigid movements, results that are directly comparable to responses in vertebrate systems. This represents the first demonstration of biological motion recognition in an invertebrate, posing crucial questions about the evolutionary history of this ability and complex visual processing in non-vertebrate systems.",591,88,237,22.0

Using light-off stimuli which elicited peak startling, we found evidence for habituation of the startle response after only a few consecutive trials. Distance travelled on startle trials was reduced when a prepulse stimulus of shorter duration was introduced before the light-off stimulus, providing behavioural evidence for prepulse inhibition (PPI). Deficits in habituation and PPI are linked to various psychiatric disorders and our method holds great potential for use alongside genetic and pharmacological manipulations.

Over both timescales, groups became less social with reduced cohesion, polarisation, group speed and information transfer. There was consistent inter-group variation (i.e. collective personality variation) for all collective motion parameters, but groups also differed in how their collective motion changed over days in their cohesion, polarisation, group speed and information transfer.

Afterwards, an ethogram was elaborated to organize the different behaviours exhibited by juvenile M. cephalus, with two general categories: a) locomotion, including three different observed behaviours (resting, swimming and fast swimming) b) feeding, including three behaviours (surface feeding, bottom feeding and rubbing). The video recordings showed that M. cephalus is a species with a constant locomotion associated to feeding, since they showed constantly movement during most of day light period the opposite to dark periods. Mullets were observed to be a non-aggressive fish species, due to the absence of dominance and aggression towards conspecifics, resulting in a high predisposition for adaptation to captivity.

A common strategy involves replacing entire behaviors with small numbers of handpicked, domain-specific features, but this approach suffers from several crucial limitations. For example, handpicked features may miss important dimensions of variability, and correlations among them complicate statistical testing. Here, by contrast, we apply the variational autoencoder (VAE), an unsupervised learning method, to learn features directly from data and quantify the vocal behavior of two model species: the laboratory mouse and the zebra finch. The VAE converges on a parsimonious representation that outperforms handpicked features on a variety of common analysis tasks, enables the measurement of moment-by-moment vocal variability on the timescale of tens of milliseconds in the zebra finch, provides strong evidence that mouse ultrasonic vocalizations do not cluster as is commonly believed, and captures the similarity of tutor and pupil birdsong with qualitatively higher fidelity than previous approaches.

Unfortunately, abuse of pesticides application by vegetable growers in Uganda increases risks of exposing consumers through the pesticide residues, as it may be above European Union Maximum Residue Limits (used as a standard in Uganda). This study is aimed to determine consumer attitudes and risk perception towards pesticide stained tomatoes available on the Ugandan local markets.Methods A cross-sectional study sampled 468 household consumers in four districts one from each region of Uganda. In each district, 60 household members from three randomly selected Sub Counties were interviewed. In addition, in each district 9 tomato handlers (3 tomato farmers, 3 tomato retailers and 3 tomato wholesalers) participated in Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) perdistrict. Collected data was entered into MS-Excel 13 and exported into STATA SE 14.0 for cleaning and analysis at below a 5% level of significance and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Proportion of risk perceptions and attitudes were computed and presented as percentages while factors associated with risk perception were determined using Fisher exact test. Qualitative data was analyzed using deductive and inductive approaches under thematic content analysis.Results More than half, 54.2% (253/468), of the respondents were females, mean age was 37 years (SD=13.13, ranging from 18 to 88 years). Half of the respondents, 50.9% (238/467), were farmers by occupation and 40.3% (188/468) had completed upper primary education. Only 5.0% (20/396) of consumers reported a high risk perception towards tomatoes stained with pesticide residues, the rest, 95.0% (376/396), were buying pesticide stained tomatoes despite their awareness about the possible health effects. The main reason for buying the pesticide stained tomatoes was that a majority, 59.0% (230/390), lacked an alternative to stained tomatoes. However, consumers generally had a negative attitude towards pesticide stained tomatoes, with 67.0% (313/468) of the consumers disagreeing to a statement that tomatoes sold on the market are safe. Consumer risk perception was significantly associated with consumer awareness about residues in the tomatoes; where the proportino of consumers who were aware of the risk of pesticide stained tomatoes were 42.8 times more likely not to buy stained tomatoes compared to the proportion of those who were not aware. OR, 42.8 (95% CI: 10.76-170.28). However, level of education P(0.975), gender P(0.581) and age-group P(0.680) were not associated with consumer risk perception after Fisher-Exact tests analysis.

Judgment biases have great potential for assessing affective states in animals, in both animal welfare and biomedical research. New animal JB tasks require construct validation, but for laboratory mice (Mus musculus), the most common research vertebrate, a valid JB task has proved elusive. Here (Experiment 1), we demonstrate construct validity for a novel mouse JB test: an olfactory Go/Go task in which subjects dig for high- or low-value food rewards. In C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice faced with ambiguous cues, latencies to dig were sensitive to high/low welfare housing, environmentally-enriched animals responding with relative ‘optimism’ through shorter latencies. Illustrating the versatility of a validated JB task across fields of research, it further allowed us to test hypotheses about the mood-altering effects of cancer (Experiment 2). Male nude mice bearing subcutaneous lung adenocarcinomas responded more pessimistically than healthy controls to ambiguous cues. Similar effects were not seen in females, however. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a mouse JB task and the first demonstration of pessimism in tumor-bearing animals.

These traits, however, can also be detrimental for health or survival, often antagonizing the evolution of extreme phenotypes. Mangrove rivulus fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) develop as self-fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodites overwhelmingly self-fertilize their eggs internally, but occasionally oviposit unfertilized eggs. Some individuals change sex to male after sexual maturity, essentially forgoing the reproductive assurance of selfing. In a continuing effort to understand how sex change to male is maintained this species, I designed an experiment to determine whether males act as choosers to increase their likelihood of finding unfertilized eggs for reproduction. I hypothesized that males would prefer to associate with younger hermaphrodites when given a dichotomous choice, as they lay a greater proportion of unfertilized eggs compared to older hermaphrodites. The males in this study did not show a preference for either the younger or older hermaphrodite but exhibited greater within individual variance across subtrials than among individual variation.

Group-living organisms across taxa, including many species of fish, birds, ungulates, and insects, use vision as the predominant modality to coordinate their collective behavior. Despite this importance, there have been few quantitative studies examining visual detection capabilities of individuals within groups. We investigate key principles underlying individual, and collective, visual detection of stimuli (which could include cryptic predators, potential food items, etc.) and how this relates to the internal structure of groups. While the individual and collective detection principles are generally applicable, we employ a model experimental system of schooling golden shiner fish (Notemigonus crysoleucas) to relate theory directly to empirical data, using computational reconstruction of the visual fields of all individuals to do so. Our integrative approach allows us to reveal how the external visual information available to each group member depends on the number of individuals in the group, the position within the group, and the location of the external visually-detectable stimulus. We find that in small groups, individuals have detection capability in nearly all directions, while in large groups, occlusion by neighbors causes detection capability to vary with position within the group. We then formulate a simple, and generally applicable, model that captures how visual detection properties emerge due to geometric scaling of the space occupied by the group and occlusion caused by neighbors. We employ these insights to discuss principles that extend beyond our specific system, such as how collective detection depends on individual body shape, and the size and structure of the group.",1241,103,476,25.0

Because these primitive eyes rarely have a defined image plane, traditional visual-optics principles cannot be applied. To assess the functional capacity of such eyes we have developed modelling principles based on ray tracing in 3D reconstructions of eye morphology, were refraction on the way to the photoreceptors and absorption in the photopigment are calculated incrementally for ray bundles from all angles withing the visual field. From the ray tracing, we calculate the complete angular acceptance function of each photoreceptor in the eye, revealing the visual acuity for all parts of the visual field. We then use this information to generate visual filters that can be applied to high resolution images or videos to convert them to accurate representations of the spatial information seen by the animal. The method is here applied to the 0.1 mm eyes of the velvet worm Euperipatoides rowelli (Onychophora). These eyes of these terrestrial invertebrates consist of a curved cornea covering an irregular but optically homogeneous lens directly joining a retina packed with photoreceptive rhabdomeres. 3D reconstruction from histological sections revealed an asymmetric eye, where the retina is deeper in the forward-pointing direction. The calculated visual acuity also reveals performance differences across the visual field, with a maximum acuity of about 0.11 cycles/deg in the forward direction despite laterally pointing eyes. The results agree with previous behavioural measurements of visual acuity, and suggest that velvet worm vision is adequate for orientation and positioning within the habitat.Author summary It is difficult to understand the roles that vision may have in animals with visual performance very different to our own. Many invertebrates such as flatworms, polychaetes, onychophorans, gastropod molluscs and numerous arthropods have tiny eyes with unknown visual abilities. At best, behavioural experiments can reveal visual performance limits for specific behaviours but they will not give general information about what is visible to the animal, which is crucial for understanding the roles vision may have. Here we use ray tracing applied to accurate anatomical/optical models of the eyes of a velvet worm to reconstruct the visual acuity in all parts of the visual field. We also use the calculated visual performance to closely simulate what animals would see in their natural habitat. The method can be applied to any (preferably small) eye and offers an alternative strategy that may yield information about the visual capacity that is otherwise hard to obtain.",196,30,87,24.0

Scientists have long debated how larger brains in primates and hominins translate into greater cognitive performance, and in particular how to control for the relationship between the non-cognitive functions of the brain and body size. One solution to this problem is to establish the slope of cognitive equivalence, that is the line connecting organisms with an identical bauplan but different body sizes. Here, we suggest that intraspecific slopes provide the best available estimate of this measure. This approach was abandoned because slopes were too low by an unknown margin due to estimation error. We control for the error problem by focusing on highly dimorphic primate species with large sample sizes and fitting a line through the mean values for adult females and males. We obtain the best estimate for the slope of ca 0.27, a value much lower than those constructed using all mammal species, and close to the value expected based on the genetic correlation between brain size and body size. We also find that the estimate of cognitive brain size based on cognitive equivalence fits empirical cognitive studies better than the encephalization quotient (EQ), which should therefore be avoided in future studies on primates, and presumably mammals and birds in general.

In this study we demonstrate that males only attempt to mate with certain females. To understand the criteria used by males and females to select a mate, we also tested the effect of age, size, and male to female size ratio on the number of mating attempts made by males and on female receptivity. We demonstrate that size and age play a role in both male and female mate choice. Our results suggest that males must reach sexual maturity after emergence and are neither receptive nor attractive to females during the first few days of their lives. We also show that older females become less attractive to males, suggesting that female S. noctilio switch to a strict host location phase sometime after emergence. Our results show that male and female size, and the ratio between them, play a role in mate choice. While larger males are more motivated to mate, their large size can physically prevent them from mating with small females. Small females are also more attractive and more receptive to males, consistent with the presence of convenience polyandry in S. noctilio.",404,42,139,30.0

Individuals segment sequences into chunks of items to perform visuo-motor tasks more fluidly, rapidly, and accurately. However, the exact dynamics of chunking processes in the case of extended practice remain unclear. Using an operant conditioning device, eighteen Guinea baboons (Papio papio) produced a fixed sequence of nine movements during 1,000 trials by pointing to a moving target on a touch screen. Response times analyses revealed a specific chunking pattern of the sequence for each baboon. More importantly, we found that these patterns evolved during the course of the experiment, with chunks becoming progressively fewer and longer. We identified two chunk reorganization mechanisms: the recombination of preexisting chunks and the concatenation of two distinct chunks into a single one. These results provide new evidence on chunking mechanisms in sequence learning and challenge current models of associative and statistical learning.",500,45,148,22.0

Here, our objective was to disentangle the roles of habitat selection and social association as drivers of collective movement in a gregarious ungulate. To accomplish this objective, we (1) assessed whether socially familiar individuals form discrete social communities and whether social communities have high spatial, but not necessarily temporal, overlap and (2) modelled the relationship between collective movement and selection of foraging habitats using socially informed integrated step selection analysis. Based on assignment of individuals to social communities and home range overlap analyses, individuals assorted into discrete social communities and these communities had high spatial overlap. By unifying social network analysis with movement ecology, we identified state-dependent social association, where individuals were less cohesive when foraging, but were cohesive when moving collectively between foraging patches. Our study demonstrates that social behaviour and space use are inter-related based on spatial overlap of social communities and state-dependent habitat selection. Movement, habitat selection, and social behaviour are linked in theory. Here, we put these concepts into practice to demonstrate that movement is the glue connecting individual habitat selection to the social environment.",446,58,193,31.0

Marrone",2020.06.07.138859;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.138859,"Contextual information is represented in the hippocampus (HPC) partially through the recruitment of distinct neuronal ensembles. It is believed that reactivation of these ensembles underlies memory retrieval processes. Recently, we showed that norepinephrine (NE) input from phasic locus coeruleus (LC) activation induces hippocampal plasticity resulting in the recruitment of new neurons and a disengagement from previously established representations. We hypothesize that NE may provide a neuromodulatory, mnemonic switch signaling the HPC to move from a state of retrieval to encoding in the presence of novelty, and therefore, plays a role in memory updating. Here, we tested whether bilateral dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) infusions of the β-adrenergic receptor (BAR) agonist isoproterenol (ISO), administered prior to encoding or retrieval, would impair spatial working and reference memory by reverting the system to encoding (thereby recruiting new neurons) potentially interfering with retrieval of the previously established spatial ensemble. We also investigated whether dDG infusions of ISO could promote cognitive flexibility by switching the system to encoding when it is adaptive (i.e. when new information is presented e.g. reversal learning). We found that intra-dDG infusions of ISO given prior to retrieval caused deficits in working and reference memory which was blocked by pre-treatment with the BAR-antagonist, propranolol (PRO). In contrast, ISO administered prior to reversal learning led to improved performance. These data support our hypothesis that NE serves as a novelty signal to update HPC contextual representations via BAR activation-facilitated recruitment of new neurons. This can be both maladaptive and adaptive depending on the situation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current work highlights the involvement of hippocampal BARs in determining the flexibility of contextual representations to promote new learning in a way that supports adaptive behavior. This work builds upon previous work showing that noradrenergic input to the hippocampus is involved in recruiting new neurons resulting in new contextual representations and may be involved in the underlying neural mechanisms that support memory updating. These data suggest targets for anxiety disorders such as PTSD, which are characterized by noradrenergic dysregulation, and may also involve impairments in memory updating mechanisms where the incorporation of new information is not effectively encoded. The further understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in updating memories may provide insight into novel treatment strategies.",1107,165,356,79.0

Pinnipeds are one of the few mammalian groups capable of vocal learning, and are therefore relevant to understanding the evolution of vocal plasticity in humans and other animals. Here, we investigate the vocal plasticity of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina), a species with vocal learning abilities attested in adulthood but not puppyhood. To zoom into early mammalian vocal development, we tested 1-3 weeks old seal pups. We tailored noise playbacks to this species and age to induce seal pups to shift their fundamental frequency (F0), rather than adapt call amplitude or temporal characteristics. We exposed individual pups to bandpass-filtered noise, which purposely spanned – and masked – their typical range of F0s, and simultaneously recorded pups’ spontaneous calls. Seals were able to modify their vocalisations quite unlike most mammals: They lowered their F0 in response to increased noise. This modulation was punctual and adapted to the particular noise condition. In addition, higher noise induced less dispersion around the mean F0, suggesting that pups may have been actively focusing their phonatory efforts to target lower frequencies. Noise masking did not seem to affect call amplitude. However, one seal showed two characteristics of the Lombard effect known for human speech in noise: significant increase in call amplitude and flattening of spectral tilt. Our relatively low noise levels may have favoured F0 shifts while inhibiting amplitude adjustments. This lowering of F0 is quite unusual, as other animals commonly display no F0 shift independently of noise amplitude. Our data represents a relatively rare case in mammalian neonates, and may have implications for the evolution of vocal plasticity across species, including humans.",315,69,149,28.0

Local song dialects have been identified in bird species with relatively simple songs where individuals show high cultural conformity5–10. In contrast, the emergence of cultural dialects has been regarded as unlikely11–13 for species with more variable song, such as the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Instead, it has been proposed that selection for individual recognition and distinctiveness may lead to a complete spread across the space of acoustic and syntactical possibilities11–15. However, another possibility is that analytical limitations have meant that subtle but possibly salient group differences have not yet been discovered in such species. Here we show that machine learning can distinguish the songs from multiple captive zebra finch populations with remarkable precision, and that these ‘cryptic song dialects’ drive strong assortative mating in this species. We studied mating patterns across three consecutive generations using captive populations that have evolved in isolation for about 100 generations. Cross-fostering eggs within and between these populations and quantifying social interactions of the resulting offspring later in life revealed that mate choice primarily targets cultural traits that are transmitted during a short developmental time window. Detailed social networks showed that females preferentially approached males whose song resembled that of their adolescent peers. Our study shows that birds can be surprisingly sensitive to cultural traits for mating that have hitherto remained cryptic, even in this well-studied species that is used as a model for song-learning13,14,16–28.",540,93,282,32.0

Ethanol is a substance found in the natural environment of Drosophila melanogaster. Accordingly, D. melanogaster has evolved specific sensory systems, physiological adaptations, and associated behaviors at its larval and adult stage to perceive and process ethanol.To systematically analyze how D. melanogaster larvae respond to naturally occurring ethanol, we examined ethanol-induced behavior in great detail by parametrically reevaluating existing approaches and comparing them with new experiments. Using behavioral assays, we confirm that larvae are attracted to different concentrations of ethanol in their environment. This behavior is controlled both by olfactory and contact cues. It is independent of previous exposure to ethanol in their food. Moreover, moderate, naturally occurring ethanol concentration of 4% results in increased larval fitness. On the contrary, higher concentrations of 10% and 20% ethanol, which rarely or never appear in nature, increase larval mortality. Finally, ethanol also serves as a positive teaching signal in learning and memory and updates valence associated with simultaneously processed odor information.Since information on how larvae perceive and process ethanol at the genetic and neuronal level is limited, the establishment of standardized assays described here is an important step towards their discovery.",632,86,193,26.0

But what drives animals to display parental behaviours towards young? In mammals, pregnancy-induced physiological transformations seem key in preparing the neural circuits that lead towards attraction (and reduced-aggression) to young. Beyond mammalian maternal behaviour, knowledge of the neural mechanisms that underlie parental care is severely lacking. We took advantage of a domesticated bird species, the Japanese quail, for which parental behaviour towards chicks can be induced through a sensitization procedure, a process that is not effective in all animals. We used the variation in parental responses to study neural transcriptomic changes associated with the sensitization procedure itself and with the outcome of the procedure (i.e., presence of parental behaviours). Out of the brain regions studied, we found that most differences in gene expression were located in the hypothalamus. Two genes identified are of particular interest, as no role in avian parental care was known for those genes. One is neurotensin, previously only demonstrated to be causally associated with maternal care in mammals. The other one is urocortin 3, causally demonstrated to affect young-directed neglect and aggression in mammals.

Motor and cognitive impairments related to sickness behavior are associated with dopamine (DA) metabolism imbalance in the prefrontal cortex. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration induces neuroinflammation and causes sickness behavior in mice, while physical exercise has anti-inflammatory properties and may attenuate sickness behavior and DA impairment. We investigated the effect of exercise on DA levels and sickness behavior induced by LPS in mice. Adult Swiss male mice (8–10 weeks, 47.1 ± 0.7 g, n=495) performed six weeks of voluntary exercise in free-running wheels (RW group) or had the blocked wheel in their cages (sedentary, SED group). After six weeks of exercise, both groups received an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of either saline (SAL) or LPS (0.33 mg/kg, i.p.). All animals were submitted to behavioral tests for sickness behavior assessment (fatigue, locomotion, anhedonia, and social interaction). Neuroinflammation markers and DA metabolism were assessed in the prefrontal cortex. LPS administration provoked anorexia, body weight loss, impaired motor function, social withdrawal, and anhedonia. This sickness behavior was accompanied by reduced cortical DA metabolism and its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). Neuroinflammation was confirmed through increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. Inflammation was also confirmed in the blood by an increased content of IL-1β. Physical exercise intervention prevented animals from neurochemical, biochemical, and behavioral alterations.

This population enables high resolution and well-powered genome wide association studies, as well as the discovery of genetic correlations. Here, we provide information on cocaine (or saline - as a control) IVSA in 65 strains of the HMDP. We found cocaine IVSA to be substantially heritable in this population, with strain-level intake ranging for near zero to &gt;25 mg/kg/session. Though saline IVSA was also found to be heritable, a very modest genetic correlation between cocaine and saline IVSA indicates that operant responding for the cocaine reinforcer was influenced by a substantial proportion of unique genetic variants. These data indicate that the HMDP is suitable for forward genetic approaches for the analysis of cocaine IVSA, and this project has also led to the discovery of reference strains with extreme cocaine IVSA phenotypes, revealing them as polygenic models of risk and resilience to cocaine reinforcement.

Visual information such as shape and colour can help the animal detect, discriminate and make appropriate behavioural decisions for mate selection, communication, camouflage, and foraging. In all major vertebrate groups, it has been shown that certain species can discriminate and prefer certain colours and that colours may increase the response to a stimulus. However, because colour is often studied together with other potentially confounding factors, it is still unclear to what extent colour discrimination plays a crucial role in the perception of and attention towards biologically relevant and irrelevant stimuli. To address these questions in reptiles, we assessed the response of three gecko species Correlophus ciliatus, Eublepharis macularius, and Phelsuma laticauda to familiar and novel 2D images in colour or grayscale. We found that while all species responded more often to the novel than to the familiar images, colour information did not influence object discrimination. We also found that the duration of interaction with images was significantly longer for the diurnal species, P. laticauda, than for the two nocturnal species, but this was independent from colouration. Finally, no differences among sexes were observed within or across species. Our results indicate that geckos discriminate between 2D images of different content independent of colouration, suggesting that colouration does not increase detectability or intensity of the response. These results are essential for uncovering which visual stimuli produce a response in animals and furthering our understanding of how animals use colouration and colour vision.",813,39,162,20.0

Previous studies of earthworm movement have focused on the use of retrograde peristaltic gaits in which controlled contraction of longitudinal and circular muscles results in waves of shortening/thickening and thinning/lengthening of the hydrostatic skeleton. These waves can propel the animal across ground as well as into soil. However, worms can also benefit from axial body bends during locomotion. Such lateral undulation dynamics can aid locomotor function via hooking/anchoring (to provide propulsion), modify travel orientation (to avoid obstacles and generate turns) and even generate snake-like undulatory locomotion in environments where peristaltic locomotion results in poor performance. To the best of our knowledge, the important aspects of locomotion associated with the lateral undulation of an earthworm body are yet to be systematically investigated. In this study, we observed that within confined environments, the worm uses lateral undulation to anchor its body to the walls of their burrows and tip (nose) bending to search the environment. This relatively simple locomotion strategy drastically improved the performance of our soft bodied robophysical model of the earthworm both in a confined (in an acrylic tube) and above-ground heterogeneous environment (rigid pegs), where the peristaltic gait often fails. In summary, lateral undulation facilitates the mobility of earthworm locomotion in diverse environments and can play an important role in the creation of low cost soft robotic devices capable of traversing a variety of environments.",677,96,224,10.0

The standard metabolic rate (SMR) of 58 juvenile catfish was positively correlated with their rates of aerial respiration in daylight when surfacing was inherently risky. SMR was positively correlated with boldness measured in two contexts, namely the time-lag to resume air-breathing in a potentially dangerous environment (T-res, measured in a respirometer), and the timelag to enter the centre of a novel environment (T-centre, measured in an open field test (OFT)). These two measures of boldness were very highly correlated. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that high SMR and an associated tendency to take risks to acquire resources are linked to increased boldness in animals. Individual SMR was positively correlated with the proportion of time the fish spent moving in the OFT, but was negatively correlated with movement speed. The data confirmed previous observations that these catfish may exhibit a bimodal distribution of T-res phenotypes, whereby individuals either resumed air-breathing relatively rapidly (&lt; 85 min, bold n = 26) or more slowly (&gt; 115 min, shy n = 31) after a startle stimulus. Bold T-res phenotypes had significantly higher SMR than shy; breathed more air during the day, and showed greater boldness but less activity and exploration in the OFT. No parallel bold/shy dichotomy was observed, however, in any measure of boldness in the OFT. Therefore, the data support propositions regarding how SMR and risk-taking should relate to boldness, but provide mixed results about how SMR relates to activity and exploration, and whether bold/shy is a dichotomy or spectrum.",681,38,183,18.0

In temperate fishes that experience a winter starvation period, for instance, a negative allometric relationship between body size and winter energy loss might explain why larger males spawn earlier in a season than smaller males, especially in fishes that exhibit paternal care, which is energetically costly and limits parental foraging opportunities. Male smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, defend nesting territories in which they care for offspring over an extended period. In northern populations, males rely on energy reserves over a winter starvation period and in spring must recoup energy losses before initiating reproduction, making them ideal systems in which to study contributions of competition and energetic allometry on differences of reproductive timing. Here, we harness data on parental male M. dolomieu from a 10-year study and show that larger males required fewer degree days-a measure of thermal energy experienced-in spring before they spawned each year and that the time of peak seasonal reproduction in the population was negatively related to the number of degree days accumulated before reproduction started. Furthermore, we found that growth of individual males between seasons better predicted changes in timing of reproduction than changes in size relative to competitors. Together, these results suggest that timing of reproduction in this population is more strongly influenced by energetic constraints than size-based competition amongst males.",614,53,131,39.0

It receives sensory input that allows an insect to keep track of the direction of sensory cues relative to its own orientation and to control movement.

One well-studied communication strategy in ants is tandem running, whereby a leader guides a recruit to a resource. Tandem running is considered an example of animal teaching because a leader adjusts her behaviour and invests time to help another ant to learn the location of a resource more efficiently. Tandem running also has costs, such as waiting inside the nest for a leader and a reduced walking speed. Whether and when these costs outweigh the benefits of tandem running is not well understood. We developed an agent-based simulation model to investigate the conditions that favour communication by tandem running during foraging. We predicted that the spatio-temporal distribution of food sources, colony size and the ratio of scouts and recruits affect colony foraging success. Our results suggest that communication is favoured when food sources are hard to find, of variable quality and long lasting. These results mirror the findings of simulations of honeybee communication. Scouts locate food sources faster than tandem followers in some environments, suggesting that tandem running may fulfil the criteria of teaching only in some situations. Furthermore, tandem running was only beneficial above a critical colony size threshold. Taken together, our model suggests that there is a considerable parameter range that favours colonies that do not use communication, which could explain why many social insects with small colony sizes forage solitarily.",1293,231,254,30.0

We investigated the progression of behavioral deficits present in CD (complete deletion) mice, a rodent model of WBS, after chronic treatment with curcumin, verapamil and a combination of both. These compounds have been proven to have beneficial effects over different cognitive aspects of various murine models and thus, may have neuroprotective effects in WBS. Treatment was administered orally dissolved in drinking water. A set of behavioral tests demonstrated the efficiency of combinatorial treatment. Some histological and molecular analyses were performed to analyze the effects of treatment and its underlying mechanism in CD mice. Behavioral improvement correlates with the molecular recovery of several affected pathways regarding MAPK signaling, in tight relation with the control of synaptic transmission. Moreover, CD mice showed an increased activated microglia density in different brain regions, which was prevented by treatment. Therefore, results show that treatment prevented behavioral deficits by recovering altered gene expression in cortex of CD mice, reducing activated microglia and normalizing Bdnf expression levels. These findings unravel the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of this novel treatment on behavioral deficits observed in CD mice, and suggest that the combination of curcumin and verapamil could be a potential candidate to treat the cognitive impairments in WBS patients.",482,53,117,24.0

They extend models from signal detection theory by proposing a simple mechanistic explanation for the observed relationship between decision outcomes and reaction times (RT). In brief, they assume that decisions are triggered once the accumulated evidence in favor of a particular alternative option has reached a predefined threshold. Fitting a DDM to empirical data then allows one to interpret observed group or condition differences in terms of a change in the underlying model parameters. However, current approaches only yield reliable parameter estimates in specific situations (c.f. fixed drift rates vs drift rates varying over trials). In addition, they become computationally unfeasible when more general DDM variants are considered (e.g., with collapsing bounds). In this note, we propose a fast and efficient approach to parameter estimation that relies on fitting a “self-consistency” equation that RT fulfill under the DDM. This effectively bypasses the computational bottleneck of standard DDM parameter estimation approaches, at the cost of estimating the trial-specific neural noise variables that perturb the underlying evidence accumulation process. For the purpose of behavioral data analysis, these act as nuisance variables and render the model “overcomplete”, which is finessed using a variational Bayesian system identification scheme. But for the purpose of neural data analysis, estimates of neural noise perturbation terms are a desirable (and unique) feature of the approach. Using numerical simulations, we show that this “overcomplete” approach matches the performance of current parameter estimation approaches for simple DDM variants, and outperforms them for more complex DDM variants. Finally, we demonstrate the added-value of the approach, when applied to a recent value-based decision making experiment.",1400,1208,785,61.0

Breeding in natal groups comes with clear costs and benefits, depending on size of the group and presence of older relatives, including mothers. Studying individual decisions about whether to stay or leave can provide insight into the mechanisms and trade-offs governing the formation and structure of family groups. We investigated the family dynamics of a large population of free-ranging commensal house mice. Using dynamic community detection on long term datasets, we determined which females first bred in their natal group. We then looked at how this influenced breeding success. We found most females (77%) exhibited strong philopatry, breeding in their natal groups. Whether a female bred elsewhere was only predictable when natal groups were extremely small and related or large and unrelated. Despite this preference, breeding elsewhere made no difference in how quickly and successfully a female bred. However, presence of their mother did lead females to breed sooner when born during high breeding activity, when competition over reproduction is high. Based on these results, potential loss of fitness does not seem to be the main driver of philopatry in female house mice. The effect of the presence of mothers may indicate retaining prior social connections is an important benefit of breeding in the natal group. Mothers providing benefits also suggests lack of conflict between generations, which is likely an important attribute in the development of extended family groups.Lay summary Whether animals breed in the group they are born in influences how they form extended family groups. Whether females stay will depend on properties such as presence of older relatives, including mothers. Using long-term wild mouse data, we track groups and which group females bred in.

Multiple-water entanglement network, derived from Ising model, has a great ability to amplify ultralow changes in the cerebral hydroxide ion concentration, and consequently, amplified hydroxide ions account for neural excitability.

Two episodes may be connected because they share a similar location, time period, activity, spatial environment, or social and emotional content. However, we lack an understanding of how each of these dimensions contributes to the perceived similarity of two life memories. We addressed this question with a data-driven approach, eliciting pairs of real-life memories from participants. Participants annotated the social, purposive, spatial, temporal, and emotional characteristics of their memories. We found that the overall similarity of memories was influenced by all of these factors, but to very different extents. Emotional features were the most consistent single predictor of overall memory similarity. Memories with different emotional tone were reliably perceived to be dissimilar, even when they occurred at similar times and places and involved similar people; conversely, memories with a shared emotional tone were perceived as similar even when they occurred at different times and places, and involved different people. A predictive model explained over half of the variance in memory similarity, using only information about (i) the emotional properties of events and (ii) the primary action or purpose of events. Emotional features may make an outsized contribution to event similarity because they provide compact summaries of an event’s goals and self-related outcomes, which are critical information for future planning and decision making. Thus, in order to understand and improve real-world memory function, we must account for the strong influence of emotional and purposive information on memory organization and memory search.Significance Our brains enable us to understand and act within the present, informed by previous, related life experience. But how are our life experiences organized so that one event can be related to another? Theories have suggested that we use spatiotemporal, social, causal, purposive, and emotional dimensions to inter-relate our memories; however, these organizing principles are usually studied using impersonal laboratory stimuli. Here, we mapped and modeled the connections between people’s own annotated life memories. We found that life events are linked by a variety of factors, but are predominantly connected in memory by their primary activity and emotional character. This highlights a need for theories of memory organization and retrieval to better account for the role of high-level actions and emotions.",2216,160,883,38.0

This natural variation in sociality and cooperative breeding behavior makes yellow-bellied marmots an ideal species within which to study the effects of maternal affiliative and agonistic social behavior on offspring. We used social network analysis to investigate the relationship between maternal social connectivity and integration on offspring summer and yearly survival, with the hypothesis that offspring with more affiliative mothers are more likely to survive than the offspring of more agonistic mothers. However, we found the inverse to be true: pups born to mothers who received more affiliative interactions were less likely to survive while the offspring of mothers who were more highly integrated into agonistic networks had enhanced survival. Overall, maternal social network measures were positively and negatively correlated with offspring survival, indicating that pups are influenced by their mother’s social world, often in contradictory ways. Relative predation risk and colony location also mediated the effects of social relationships on pup survival.

We expect females to be highly responsive to environmental variation, with significant impacts on fitness given females’ direct impact on offspring number, size, and developmental conditions. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we manipulate (a) exposure to conspecific females, expected to influence their expectation of number of potential mates and larval density for their own offspring, and (b) test how prior consexual population density interacts with the spatial distribution of potential oviposition sites, with females expected to prefer clustered food resources that can support a larger number of eggs and larvae. After exposure to competition, females were slower to start copulating and reduced their copulation duration – the opposite effect to that observed in males previously exposed to rivals. There was a parallel and perhaps related effect on egg production, with females previously housed in groups laying fewer eggs than those that were housed in solitude. The spatial distribution of resources also influenced oviposition behaviour: females clearly preferred aggregated patches of substrate, being more likely to lay, and laying on more of the available patches, in the clustered environment. However, we found no significant interaction between prior housing conditions and resource patchiness, indicating that females did not perceive the value of different resource distributions differently when they were expecting either high or low levels of larval competition. While exposure to consexual competition influences copulatory behaviours, it is the distribution of oviposition resources that has a greater impact on oviposition decisions.",1022,73,272,27.0

The rewards gained by attending to this social information must be balanced against the costs of obtaining and processing it. Previous work has investigated the behaviour of rational agents that respond optimally to a full sequence of prior decisions. However, such full sequences are potentially difficult to perceive and costly to process. As such, real animals are likely to rely on simpler forms of information when making decisions, which in turn will affect the social behaviour they exhibit. In this paper I derive the optimal policy for rational agents responding to specific simplified forms of social information. I show how the behaviour of agents attending to the total aggregate number of previous choices differs from those attending to more dynamic information provided by the most recent prior decision, and I propose a hybrid strategy that incorporates both information sources to give a highly accurate approximation to the optimal policy with the full sequence. Finally I analyse the evolutionary stability of each strategy depending on the cost of cognition and perception, showing that a hybrid strategy dominates when this cost is low but non-zero, while attending to the most recent decision is dominant when costs are high. These results show that agents can employ highly effective social decision-making rules without requiring unrealistic cognitive capacities, and point to likely ecological variation in the social information different animals attend to.",859,50,271,13.0

While many studies in animal cognition suggest that they are able to adeptly avoid obstacles, it is unclear whether a new route is learned to navigate around these barriers and, if so, what sensory information may be used to do so. We investigated detour learning ability in the Australian bull ant, Myrmecia midas, which primarily uses visual landmarks to navigate. We first placed a barrier on the ants’ natural path of their foraging tree. Initially, 46% of foragers were unsuccessful in detouring the obstacle. In subsequent trips, the ants became more successful and established a new route. We observed up to eight successful foraging trips detouring around the barrier. When we subsequently changed the position of the barrier, made a new gap in the middle of the obstacle, or removed the barrier altogether, ants mostly maintained their learned motor routine, detouring with a similar path as before, suggesting that foragers were not relying on barrier cues and therefore learned a new route around the obstacle. In additional trials, when foragers encountered new olfactory or tactile cues, or the visual environment was blocked, their navigation was profoundly disrupted. These results suggest that changing sensory information, even in modalities that foragers do not usually need for navigation, drastically affects the foragers’ ability to successful navigate.Subject Category Neuroscience and Cognition",699,75,193,20.0

We tested whether the recognition of common environmental sounds depends on the inference of a basic physical variable – the source intensity (i.e., the power that produces a sound). A source’s intensity can be inferred from the intensity it produces at the ear and its distance, which is normally conveyed by reverberation. Listeners could thus use intensity at the ear and reverberation to constrain recognition by inferring the underlying source intensity. Alternatively, listeners might separate these acoustic cues from their representation of a sound’s identity in the interest of invariant recognition. We compared these two hypotheses by measuring recognition accuracy for sounds with typically low or high source intensity (e.g., pepper grinders vs. trucks) that were presented across a range of intensities at the ear or with reverberation cues to distance. The recognition of low-intensity sources (e.g., pepper grinders) was impaired by high presentation intensities or reverberation that conveyed distance, either of which imply high source intensity. Neither effect occurred for high-intensity sources. The results suggest that listeners implicitly use the intensity at the ear along with distance cues to infer a source’s power and constrain its identity. The recognition of real-world sounds thus appears to depend upon the inference of their physical generative parameters, even generative parameters whose cues might otherwise be separated from the representation of a sound’s identity.",1187,162,478,71.0

The remarkable ecological success of social insects seems to have been largely driven by ergonomic advantages stemming from the behavioral specialization of workers. However, little is known about how individuals and their corresponding behavioral repertoires are related to each other within a division of labor context, particularly by viewing such relationships as complex networks. Applications of network theory to the study of social insects are almost exclusively used to analyze behavioral interactions between individuals, rather than to the study of relations among individuals and behaviors. Here, we use an approach to the study of the organization of the behavioral repertoire of ant colonies that considers both individual-behavior interactions and behavior-behavior interactions, besides colony time budgets. Our study investigates the organization of division of labor in colonies of the trap-jaw ant Odontomachus chelifer (Latreille, 1802). All the behavioral acts (including inactivity) performed within three queenright colonies of different sizes (n = 7, 30, and 60 workers) were studied under controlled laboratory conditions. Each ant was individually marked and observed by scan sampling in 10 min intervals for 10 h each (n = 5,919 behavioral acts). We describe the network topologies in terms of centrality, specialization, modularity, and nestedness. This study shows that workers of O. chelifer are organized according to structured networks, composed of individuals exhibiting varying degrees of specialization. The observed centrality scores indicate that some behaviors could have a disproportionately larger impact on the network organization (especially self-grooming). The results underscore the potential of the use of complex networks (particularly measures of modularity and nestedness) in order to discover and study novel organizational patterns of social groups in animal behavior.",1338,134,327,33.0

Prior research suggests differences between initial and reversal learning, including higher learning rates, a greater need for inhibitory control, and more perseveration after reversals. However, it is not well-understood what aspects of stimulus-based reversal learning are unique to reversals, and whether and how observed differences depend on reward probability. Here, we used a visual probabilistic discrimination and reversal learning paradigm where male and female rats selected between a pair of stimuli associated with different reward probabilities. We compared accuracy, rewards collected, omissions, latencies, win-stay/lose-shift strategies, and indices of perseveration across two different reward probability schedules. We found that discrimination and reversal learning are behaviorally more unique than similar: latencies to select the better option, win-stay strategies, and perseveration were of a different pattern in reversal learning compared to discrimination learning. Additionally, fit of choice behavior using reinforcement learning models revealed a lower sensitivity to the difference in subjective reward values (greater exploration) and higher learning rates for the reversal phase. Interestingly, a consistent reward probability group difference emerged with a richer environment associated with longer reward collection latencies than a leaner environment. We also replicated previous reports on sex differences in reversal learning. Future studies should systematically compare the neural correlates of fine-grained behavioral measures to reveal possible dissociations in how the circuitry is recruited in each phase.",1917,221,700,52.0

Honey bee workers forage for floral resources, a behavior that requires the learning and long-term memory of visual landmarks, but how these memories are mapped to the brain remains poorly understood. To address this gap in our understanding, we collected bees that successfully learned visual associations in a conditioned aversion paradigm and compared gene expression correlates of memory formation in the mushroom bodies, a higher-order sensory integration center classically thought to contribute to learning, as well as the optic lobes, the primary visual neuropil responsible for sensory transduction of visual information. We quantitated expression of CREB and CaMKii, two classical genetic markers of learning and fen-1, a gene specifically associated with punishment learning in vertebrates. As expected, we report substantial involvement of the mushroom bodies for all three markers but additionally demonstrate an unexpected involvement of the optic lobes across a similar time course. Our findings imply the molecular involvement of a sensory neuropil during visual associative learning parallel to a higher-order brain region, furthering our understanding of how a tiny brain processes environmental signals.",1264,165,349,22.0

We explored conditions for the emergence of resource partitioning among traplining bees using agent-based models built from experimental data of bumblebees foraging on artificial flowers. In the models, bees learn to develop routes as a consequence of feedback loops that change their probabilities of moving between flowers. While a positive reinforcement of movements leading to rewarding flowers is sufficient for the emergence of resource partitioning when flowers are evenly distributed, addition of negative reinforcement of movements leading to unrewarding flowers is necessary when flowers are patchily distributed. In environments with more complex spatial structure, the negative experiences of individual bees on flowers favour spatial segregation and efficient collective foraging.",788,85,187,49.0

They primarily propagate via asexual reproduction under normal and healthy environmental conditions. Environmental stimuli that signal a shift to disadvantageous conditions induce D. magna to change their mode of reproduction from asexual to sexual reproduction. During the sexual reproduction phase, they produce special tough eggs (resting eggs), which can survive severe environmental conditions. Despite our increased understanding of their mating behaviours, the sex-specific characteristics of swimming behaviours among daphnid species are poorly understood. In this study, we analysed the swimming patterns and dynamics of female and male adult D. magna. First, we found laterally biased diffusion of males in contrast to the homogeneous, nondirectional diffusion of females. Second, computer modelling analysis using a discrete-time Markov chain simulation, in which the frequencies of turning behaviour were evaluated as probability distributions, explained the greater diffusion of males in the horizontal direction. Under the presumption that high diffusion in the horizontal direction increases the probability of encountering a distant mate, these findings led us to hypothesise that male D. magna increase genotype heterogeneity by effectively selecting the probability distributions of certain motion parameters.Summary statements We analysed the swimming behaviours of adult water flea Daphnia magna, and found apparent sexual differences: laterally biased diffusion of males in contrast to the nondirectional diffusion of females.",687,86,129,43.0

However, relatively few studies have examined how animals respond to the landscape below them, which could affect speed through modifications in climb rate and perceived predation risk. We equipped homing pigeons (Columba livia) with high frequency loggers to examine how flight speed varies in relation to topography and land cover, predicting that these parameters may have a substantial impact on flight speed and hence cost. Pigeons showed mixed evidence for an energy saving strategy, as they minimised climb rates by starting their ascent ahead of hills, but selected rapid speeds in their ascents. Birds did not modify their speed substantially in relation to land cover, but higher speeds were observed during descending flight, highlighting the importance to consider the rate of change in altitude before estimating power use from speed. Finally, we document an unexpected variability in speed and altitude over fine scales; a source of substantial inefficiency. We suggest this may a form of protean behaviour adopted to reduce predation risk when flocking is not an option, and that such a strategy could be widespread.",677,45,161,19.0

Lower ranked individuals often do not reproduce themselves but perform cooperative behaviours to help the reproductive output of dominant individuals or the group as a whole. Theoretical models suggest that individuals of higher rank should show increased amounts of aggressive behaviours, such as aggressions towards other group members, but should decrease the amount of cooperative behaviours, such as brood care or territory maintenance. Most empirical tests of these models focus on insect or mammalian systems where kin selection plays a large role, rather than animals that live in groups of unrelated individuals. Here we use two anemonefish species to test hypotheses of variation in cooperation and aggression with respect to social rank and species, for social systems where group members are unrelated. We assessed the behaviours of each rank in 20 groups of Amphiprion percula and 12 groups of A. perideraion in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. We also performed a removal experiment to test if cooperative and aggressive behaviours are likely adaptive, i.e., if they change as an individual ascends in rank. Our results show differences between the two species, with A. percula showing more cooperative behaviours and A. perideraion showing more aggressive behaviours, despite them being closely related and sharing a very similar ecology. With respect to both cooperation and aggression we found consistent differences between ranks in both species, with higher ranks performing more aggressive as well as more cooperative behaviours. When we experimentally provided lower ranked individuals (rank 4) an opportunity to ascend in the hierarchy, they showed more aggression and more cooperation in line with our observations for rank 3 individuals. Thus, we show that rank specific behavioural patterns are likely adaptive in anemonefishes and that some model predictions do not hold in systems where kin selection benefits are absent. Rather, future fitness benefits through territory inheritance and group augmentation likely motivate cooperative and aggressive behaviours by subordinates in groups of unrelated vertebrates.",982,100,212,32.0

However, we here show that by using the skew and kurtosis in addition to the mean, optical flow patterns can be used to deliver information not just about the flock average but also about the proportion of individuals in different movement categories. We correlated flock optical flow patterns with the behaviour of a sample of 16 birds per flock in two runway tests and a water (latency-to-lie) test. In the runway tests, there was a positive correlation between the time taken to complete the runway and the skew and kurtosis of optical flow on day 28 of flock life (slow individuals came from flocks with a high skew and kurtosis). In the water test, there was a positive correlation between the length of time the birds remained standing and the mean and variance of flock optical flow (the most mobile individuals came from flocks with the highest mean). Patterns at flock level thus contain valuable information about the welfare of the individuals that compose the flock.Simple Summary Technology on farms potentially brings benefits of improved animal health, welfare and productivity as well as reduction in disease, waste and environmental impact. However, it also raises public concern about the welfare of individual animals, particularly when applied to large groups such as broiler (meat) chickens. We here address this issue by showing that camera technology can both provide life-long continuous monitoring of the welfare of whole flocks and also give crucial information about the individuals making up the flock. The cameras detect variation between individuals and are also sensitive to birds moving abnormally. By testing birds individually, we show that slow-moving birds tended to come from flocks that moved slowly overall and showed large variation between individuals whereas fast-moving birds were more likely to come from more active flocks that moved more uniformly. Properly used, camera technology can thus monitor the welfare of flocks continuously throughout their lives while reflecting the behaviour of individual birds.",706,37,148,16.0

We found different behavioral responses to violations of presence and absence, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Importantly, chicks displayed an avian signature of novelty detection to violations of absence, namely a sex-dependent left-eye-bias.

We find that individual communicative repertoires are significantly larger in captive compared to wild settings, irrespective of species, age-sex class or sampling effort. Twenty percent of the orang-utan repertoire in captivity were not observed in the wild. In Sumatran orang-utans, the more sociable species, functional specificity was also higher in captive versus wild settings.

There is evidence that courtship song characteristics vary between different genotypes, but little is known on whether individuals, even within the same genotype, differ from each other in the composition, complexity, and temporal consistency of their songs. In a first study, we aimed to systematically identify song features typical of different genotypes, by assessing the composition and complexity (i.e., entropy) of the syllabic sequences of male laboratory mice from four different strains (Mus musculus f. domestica: C57BL/6J, BALB/c, DBA/2 and B6D2F1). Mice were individually presented with a swab containing fresh female urine for 5 minutes to elicit courtship songs. The four strains differed not only in the composition but also in the complexity of their syllabic sequences. In a second study, we investigated within-strain individual differences in temporal consistency and recurring motifs (i.e., identical sets of syllables that are repeated within a song), using BALB/c and DBA/2 mice. The same procedure as in the first study was followed, but in addition testing was repeated weekly over three weeks. Both strains showed some level of individual temporal consistency; BALB/c in the overall amount of emitted vocalisations and DBA/2 in the expression of specific syllable types. However, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed remarkable individual variability in how consistent song characteristics were over time. Furthermore, recurring motifs were expressed at varying levels depending on the individual. Taken together, not only genotype but also individuality can affect variability in courtship songs in mice, suggesting the existence of different courtship strategies (e.g., higher song consistency to facilitate individual identification) related to varying levels of behavioural plasticity.HIGHLIGHTSCourtship songs in mice can serve as a model to study vocal communicationWe explore how genotype and individuality affect courtship songs’ characteristicsGenotypes differ in composition and also in complexity of syllabic sequencesWe find remarkable individual variability in how consistent songs are over timeResults suggest the existence of variation in male courting behaviour",1440,39,268,51.0

While the exact etiology of this predisposition remains unclear, PTSD canonically increases overall sympathetic tone resulting in increased norepinephrine (NE) outflow. Previously, we demonstrated that exogenous NE alters mitochondrial superoxide in T-lymphocytes to produce a pro-inflammatory T-helper 17 (TH17) phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized sympathetic-driven neuroimmune interactions could mediate psychological trauma-induced T-lymphocyte inflammation.Methods Repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) is a preclinical murine model that recapitulates the behavioral, autonomic, and inflammatory aspects of PTSD. Targeted splenic denervation (Dnx) was performed to deduce the contribution of splenic sympathetic nerves to RSDS-induced inflammation. Eighty-five C57BL/6J mice underwent Dnx or sham-operation, followed by RSDS or control paradigms. Animals were assessed for behavioral, autonomic, inflammatory, and redox profiles.Results Dnx did not alter the antisocial or anxiety-like behavior induced by RSDS.

In a light/dark T-maze, approximately 70% of a group of Drosophila fruit flies choose the bright arm of the T-Maze, while the remaining 30% walk into the dark. Taking the photopositive and the photonegative subgroups and re-testing them reveals the spontaneous component: a similar 70-30 distribution emerges in each of the two subgroups. Increasing the number of choices to ten choices, reveals the individuality component: flies with extremely negative first choices were more likely to show photonegative behavior in subsequent choices and vice versa. General behavioral traits, independent of light/dark preference, contributed to the development of this individuality. The interaction of individuality and spontaneity together explains why group averages, even for such seemingly stereotypical behaviors, are poor predictors of individual choices.",1874,127,454,25.0

Neuroimaging studies have suggested that the anterior insula is a ‘common core’ brain region that is impaired across neurological and psychiatric disorders, which include social cognition deficits. Nevertheless, neurobiological mechanisms of the anterior insula for social cognition remain elusive.Methods To determine the role of anterior insula in social cognition, we manipulated expression of Cyp26B1, an anterior insula-enriched molecule that is crucial for retinoic acid degradation and involved in the pathology of neuropsychiatric conditions. Social cognition was mainly assayed using the three-chamber social interaction test. We conducted multimodal analyses at the molecular, cellular, circuitry, and behavioral levels.Results At the molecular/cellular level, anterior insula-mediated social novelty recognition is maintained by proper activity of the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, for which retinoic acid-mediated gene transcription can play a role. We also demonstrate that oxytocin influences the anterior insula-mediated social novelty recognition, not by direct projection of oxytocin neurons, nor by direct diffusion of oxytocin to the anterior insula, which contrasts the modes of oxytocin regulation onto the posterior insula. Instead, oxytocin affects oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus where serotonergic neurons are projected to the anterior insula. Furthermore, we show that serotonin 5HT2C receptor expressed in the anterior insula influences social novelty recognition.Conclusions Anterior insula plays a pivotal role in social novelty recognition that is partly regulated by a local retinoic acid cascade, but also remotely regulated by oxytocin via a non-classic mechanism.",1153,60,307,37.0

In this study, we improved the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm experiment to study the false memory. The memory materials are combined with mixed emotions, which are closer to real life. Twenty-eight participants were randomly divided into positive group and negative group. We used music to induce the participants in the positive group and the negative group to generate corresponding emotions. Finally, we analyzed the difference between the positive group and the negative group from the behavior data, source location and cortex functional network of event related potential. The results of behavioral data analysis show that the false memory rate of positive group (85%) is significantly higher than that of negative group (72%). The results of source localization show that the brain of the positive group is more active than that of the negative group, and the difference of brain activation location between the two groups is mainly manifested in the BA24 and BA45 brain regions. The results of cortex functional network show that the node degree, clustering coefficient, global efficiency and small-world property of the positive group are significantly higher than those of the negative group.

Expected Utility Theory describes risky choices as a utility maximization process: we choose the option with the highest subjective value (utility), which we compute considering both the option’s value and its associated risk. According to the random utility maximization framework, riskless choices could also be based on a utility measure. Neuronal mechanisms of utility-based choice may thus be common to both risky and riskless choices. This assumption would require the existence of a utility function that accounts for both risky and riskless decisions. Here, we investigated whether the choice behavior of macaque monkeys in riskless and risky decisions could be described by a common underlying utility function. We found that the utility functions elicited in the two choice scenarios were different from each other, even after taking into account the contribution of subjective probability weighting. Our results suggest that distinct utility representations exist for riskless and risky choices, which could reflect distinct neuronal representations of the utility quantities, or distinct brain mechanisms for risky and riskless choices.

In 22 wild meerkat (Suricata suricatta) clans, we show that matriarchs 1) express peak androgen concentrations during late gestation, 2) when displaying peak feeding competition, dominance, and evictions, and 3) relative to subordinates, produce offspring that are more aggressive in early development.

Deep neural networks (DNN) can be applied to any image, and recently have emerged as state-of-the-art models of object recognition in the primate ventral visual pathway. Using these DNN models, we ask whether object recognition explains limitations on performance across visual search tasks. First, we show that DNNs exhibit a hallmark effect seen when participants search simplified stimuli. Further experiments show this effect results from optimizing for object recognition: DNNs trained from randomly-initialized weights do not exhibit the same performance limitations. Next, we test DNN models of object recognition with natural images, using a dataset where each image has a visual search difficulty score, derived from human reaction times. We find DNN accuracy is inversely correlated with visual search difficulty score. Our findings suggest that to a large extent visual search performance is explained by object recognition.",1253,312,377,34.0

As predictors, cues can elicit adaptive behavior and lead to valuable resources (e.g., food). For some individuals, however, cues are transformed into incentive stimuli and elicit motivational states that can be maladaptive. The goal-tracker/sign-tracker animal model captures individual differences in cue-motivated behaviors, with reward-associated cues serving as predictors of reward for both phenotypes but becoming incentive stimuli to a greater degree for sign-trackers. While these distinct phenotypes are characterized based on Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior, they exhibit differences on a number of behaviors relevant to psychopathology. To further characterize the neurobehavioral endophenotype associated with individual differences in cue-reward learning, neuroendocrine and behavioral profiles associated with stress and anxiety were investigated in male goal-tracker, sign-tracker, and intermediate responder rats. It was revealed that baseline corticosterone increases with Pavlovian learning, but to the same degree, regardless of phenotype. No significant differences in behavior were observed between goaltrackers and sign-trackers during an elevated plus maze or open field test, nor were there differences in corticosterone response to the open field test or physiological restraint. Upon examination of central markers associated with stress-reactivity, we found that sign-trackers have greater glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in the ventral hippocampus, with no phenotypic differences in the dorsal hippocampus or prelimbic cortex. These findings demonstrate that goal-trackers and sign-trackers do not differ on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, and suggest that differences in neuroendocrine measures between these phenotypes can be attributed to distinct cue-reward learning styles.Significance Statement While the goal-tracker/ sign-tracker animal model derives from individual differences in Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior, other traits, including some of relevance to addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, have been shown to co-exist with the propensity to sign-track. The extent to which this model encompasses differences in aversive arousal and associated neuroendocrine measures, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we show that behavioral and corticosterone response to stress-related paradigms do not differ between goal-trackers and sign-trackers. However, glucocorticoid receptor expression in the ventral hippocampus does differ between phenotypes, suggesting that this central marker that is typically associated with stress-responsivity, may, in fact, play an important role in appetitive motivation.",1083,137,280,51.0

Here we explore how the dynamics of animal behaviour in the ubiquitous tasks of mate-search and competition can arise from a physics-based model of effective interactions. Male orb-weaving spiders of the genus Trichonephila are faced with the daunting challenge of entering the web of a much larger and potentially cannibalistic female, approaching her, and fending off rival males. The interactions that govern the dynamics of males within the confined two-dimensional arena of the female’s web are dominated by seismic vibrations. This unifying modality allows us to describe the spiders as interacting active particles, responding only to effective forces of attraction and repulsion due to the female and rival males. Our model is based on a detailed analysis of experimental spider trajectories, obtained during the approach of males towards females, and amidst their interactions with rival males of different sizes. The dynamics of ’spider particles’ that emerges from our theory allows us to explain a puzzling relationship between the density of males on the web and the reproductive advantages of large males. Our results provide strong evidence that the simple physical rules at the basis of our model can give rise to complex fitness related behaviours in this system.",1050,33,289,11.0

Yet, structured behavioral patterns – or “statistical ethograms” – are not immediately apparent from the full spatiotemporal data that behavioral scientists usually collect. Here, we introduce a framework to quantitatively characterize rodent behavior during spatial (e.g., maze) navigation, in terms of movement building blocks or motor primitives. The hypothesis that we pursue is that rodent behavior is characterized by a small number of motor primitives, which are combined over time to produce open-ended movements. We assume motor primitives to be organized in terms of two sparsity principles: each movement is controlled using a limited subset of motor primitives (sparse superposition) and each primitive is active only for time-limited, time-contiguous portions of movements (sparse activity). We formalize this hypothesis using a sparse dictionary learning method, which we use to extract motor primitives from rodent position and velocity data collected during spatial navigation, and successively to reconstruct past trajectories and predict novel ones. Three main results validate our approach. First, rodent behavioral trajectories are robustly reconstructed from incomplete data, performing better than approaches based on standard dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, or single sparsity. Second, the motor primitives extracted during one experimental session generalize and afford the accurate reconstruction of rodent behavior across successive experimental sessions in the same or in modified mazes. Third, in our approach the number of motor primitives associated with each maze correlates with independent measures of maze complexity, hence showing that our formalism is sensitive to essential aspects of task structure. The framework introduced here can be used by behavioral scientists and neuroscientists as an aid for behavioral and neural data analysis. Indeed, the extracted motor primitives enable the quantitative characterization of the complexity and similarity between different mazes and behavioral patterns across multiple trials (i.e., habit formation). We provide example uses of this computational framework, showing how it can be used to identify behavioural effects of maze complexity, analyze stereotyped behavior, classify behavioral choices and predict place and grid cell displacement in novel environments.",1319,316,354,23.0

Furthermore, Z4-11Al, which mediates upwind flight attraction in both sexes, also elicits courtship in experienced males.Twin variants of the olfactory receptor Or69a are co-expressed in the same olfactory sensory neurons, and feed into the same glomerulus in the antennal lobe. Z4-11Al is perceived via Or69aB, while the food odorant (R)-linalool is a main ligand for the other variant, Or69aA. That Z4-11Al mediates courtship in experienced males, not (R)- linalool, is probably due to courtship learning.

Echolocating bats, and in particular, the CF-FM calls of high-duty cycle bats serve as a convenient model system to illustrate this point. The CF component in the CF-FM call is used for prey detection and the FM component is used in target ranging. According to the behavioural context at hand such as flight with conspecifics or prey capture, bats choose to increase the duration, intensity or spectral range of the components differently. Studying the call component alterations requires an objective methodology that first segments the components and then allows measurements on them. Studies till now have segmented the call components manually, or automatically using what I term the ‘peak-frequency’ method. Manual segmentation is error prone, while the ‘peak-frequency’ method requires on-axis recordings for good results. Despite multiple papers using a peak-frequency based segmentation, there remain no publicly available software implementations. itsfm is an open-source package that fills this gap with two implemntations that can segment CF-FM calls, one of them being an implementation of the peak-percentage method. itsfm additionally introduces the ‘pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution’ (PWVD) method for call segmentation, thus allowing the segmentation of calls captured under a wider variety of recording conditions. I create a synthetic dataset and assess the performance of the PWVD method and the ‘peak-frequency’ method. The PWVD performs consistently well in call component segmentation in comparison to the peak-percentage method.

To exclude the alternative that these positive cross-correlations may merely reflect the general biological quality of an organism or an inevitable by-product of having brains it is paramount to provide solid evidence for the absence of g in at least some species. Here, we show that wild-caught cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus, a fish species otherwise known for its highly sophisticated social behaviour, completely lacks g when tested on ecologically non-relevant tasks. Moreover, performance in these experiments was not or negatively correlated with an ecologically relevant task, and in none of the tasks did fish caught from a high population density site outperform fish from a low-density site. g is thus unlikely a default result of how brains are designed, and not an automatic consequence of variation in social complexity.

However, sexual selection on male competitiveness may alter male courtship decisions in the face of cannibalism risk. We investigated the effect of prey availability and rival presence on male mating decisions in the highly cannibalistic Springbok mantis, Miomantis caffra. We found that males approached females more rapidly and mated more often in the presence of prey, suggesting that females distracted with foraging may be less of a threat. The presence of a rival also hastened the onset of copulation and led to higher mating success, with very large effects occurring in the presence of both prey and rivals, indicating that intrasexual competition may intensify attraction to foraging females. Taken together, our results suggest that pre-copulatory cannibalism has selected for male preference for foraging females, and that males adjust their mating strategy to both the risk of competition and the threat of cannibalism.LAY SUMMARY Deciding when to approach a mate is critical for male mantises at risk of being cannibalised. A male might do well to pounce when a female is distracted with prey, but what if a nearby male has the same intention?

Despite its growing role in preclinical research, there is a lack of studies assessing species-specific housing needs, which presents a challenge for research facilities seeking to ensure good welfare and obtaining high-quality experimental data. Indeed, captive California mice present a high prevalence of stereotypic backflipping behavior, a common consequence of suboptimal housing and a potential source of experimental outcome variability. Using three different cage systems, the present studies show that increasing housing space as well as social and environmental complexity can delay the development of stereotypic behavior in male and female California mice. Critically, this reduction in stereotypy is accompanied by increased effect sizes of stress in an established model for social anxiety. These results suggest that increased cage size and enrichment could enhance welfare in California mice while simultaneously increasing the quality of behavioral experiments.",945,68,184,22.0

Interestingly, the emotional challenge reinstated the differences in performance between the two groups, revealing that chronic stress/overtraining did not eliminate spatial memory. Differences caused by previous stressors can re-emerge depending on the more immediate psychological state of the individual. Contrary to spatial memory, cue-based memory was not impaired in any test occasion, confirming that this form of memory is resistant to chronic stress. Altogether these findings reveal a dynamic dialogue between stress, training, and memory systems in birds.",974,41,155,20.0

Numerous examples of socially-driven habitat partitioning and ecological-niche specialization can be found among vertebrates, including toothed whales. But such social-ecological dynamics, described here as ‘social niche partitioning’, are not known among baleen whales, whose societies -- particularly on foraging grounds -- are largely perceived as unstructured and incidental to matters of habitat use and conservation. However, through 16 years of behavioral and photo-identification observations of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding within a fjord system in British Columbia, Canada, we have documented long-term pair bonds (lasting up to 12 years) as well as a complex societal structure, which corresponds closely to persistent patterns in feeding strategy, long-term site fidelity (extended seasonal occupancy and annual rate of return up to 75%), specific geographic preferences within the fjord system, and other forms of habitat use. Randomization tests of network congruency and clustering algorithms were used to test for overlap in patterns of social structure and habitat use, which confirmed the occurrence of social niche partitioning on the feeding grounds of this baleen whale. In addition, we document the extensive practice of group bubble net feeding in Pacific Canada. This coordinated feeding behavior was found to strongly mediate the social structure and habitat use within this humpback whale society. Additionally, during our 2004 – 2019 study, we observed a shift in social network structure in 2010 – 2012, which corresponded with environmental and demographic shifts including a sudden decline in the population’s calving rate. Our findings indicate that the social lives of humpback whales, and perhaps baleen whales generally, are more complex than previously supposed and should be a primary consideration in the assessment of potential impacts to important habitat.",1283,135,261,39.0

However, the first claim has never been directly tested. I test it directly at three levels using data from primates and ungulates. First, I show that the females of monogamous genera do not have territories that are significantly larger, either absolutely or relatively, than those of polygamous genera. Second, using both the Mitani-Rodman and Lowen-Dunbar inequalities, I show that, given their typical day journey lengths, males of most monogamous species could easily defend an area large enough to allow them to monopolise as many as 5-10 females if these ranged solitarily. Finally, I use a model of male mate searching strategies to show that, unlike the males of socially-living polygamous species, the opportunity cost that monogamous males incur is typically more than five times the reproductive success they have by being obligately monogamous. This suggests that the selection pressure dissuading them from pursuing a roving male strategy must be very considerable.",900,53,107,48.0

Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), as well as wolves (Canis lupus), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), and lions (Panthera leo), perform gang attacks during raids. In raids, a few individuals of a group enter another group’s territory and attack its members if found in numerical disadvantage. Current theory predicts that raids and gang attacks are linked to fission-fusion dynamics, i.e., the capacity of a group to split into smaller subgroups of variable size and composition. However, over the last decade, research on social mammals without fission-fusion societies nor raiding have shown that they may also be involved in intergroup lethal gang attacks. Thus, neither fission-fusion dynamics nor raiding are required for gang attacks to evolve. Based on our first-ever reports of intergroup gang attacks in the crested macaque (Macaca nigra), combined with the synthesis of earlier observations of such attacks in several species living in stable groups, we develop a new hypothesis about the proximate causes leading to lethal intergroup aggression. We propose that the ability to estimate numerical odds, form coalitionary bonds, and show hostility towards outgroup individuals may suffice to trigger intergroup gang attacks when the conditions favour an imbalance of power between victims and attackers.",1212,98,167,23.0

There are two types of soaring: thermal soaring, used by condors and frigatebirds, which involves the use of updrafts to ascend and then glide horizontally over the land or the sea; and dynamic soaring, used by albatrosses, which involves the use of wind speed differences with height above the sea surface. Previous studies have suggested that Pelagornis sandersi used dynamic soaring, while Argenthavis magnificens, Pteranodon, and Quetzalcoatlus used thermal soaring. However, the performance and wind speed requirements of dynamic and thermal soaring for these species have not yet been quantified comprehensively. We quantified these values using aerodynamic models and compared them with that of extant birds. For dynamic soaring, we quantified maximum flight speeds and maximum upwind flight speeds. For thermal soaring, we quantified the animal’s sinking speed circling at a given radius and how far it could glide losing a given height. Our results confirmed those from previous studies that Pteranodon and Argentavis magnificens used thermal soaring. Conversely, the results for Pelagornis sandersi and Quetzalcoatlus were contrary to those from previous studies. Pelagornis sandersi used thermal soaring, and Quetzalcoatlus had a poor ability both in dynamic and thermal soaring. Our results demonstrate the need for comprehensive assessments of performance and required wind conditions when estimating soaring styles of extinct flying species.",5351,1053,861,37.0

Here we ran laboratory experiments to compare trapline formation and efficiency by foragers of two social bee species that differ in their collective foraging strategies: the solo foraging bumblebee Bombus terrestris and the mass foraging honey bee Apis mellifera. In a simple routing task with four artificial flowers, both bumblebees and honey bees developed a stable route, although honey bees were slower and less efficient to do so. In a more complex routing task with six flowers, only bumblebees developed a stable route. Honey bees took a longer time to discover all flowers and never integrated them in a single route. Simulations of a model of trapline formation show that these inter-specific differences can be replicated by adjusting the strength of a single learning parameter. Comparing bumblebees and honey bees in the same experimental conditions thus revealed key differences in their spatial foraging strategies, potentially driven by social constraints.",1239,94,198,25.0

First-time rodent dams seek and gather wandering/scattered pups back to the nest (pup retrieval), an essential aspect of maternal care. Over the decades, qualitative observations of the behaving animal have been presented in quantitative discrete units. However, systematic analysis of the dynamic sequences of goal-related movements that comprise the entire behavioral sequence, which would be ultimately essential for understanding the underlying neurobiology, is usually not analyzed. Here, we present systematic analysis of pup retrieval behavior across three days in alloparental female mice (Surrogates or Sur) of two genotypes; Mecp2Heterozygotes (Het), a female mouse model for a neuropsychiatric disorder called Rett syndrome and their wild type (WT) siblings. Additionally, we analyzed CBA/CaJ and C57BL/6J WT surrogates for within-strain comparisons. Frame-by-frame analysis over different phases was performed manually using DataVyu software.We previously showed that Het are inefficient, by measuring latency and errors, at pup retrieval. Here, we show that the sequence of searching, pup-approach and good retrieval crystallizes over time for WT; this sequence does not crystallize in Het. We found that goal-related movements of Het in different phases were similar to WT, suggesting context-driven atypical dynamic patterns in Het. We also identified pup approach and pup grooming as atypical tactile interactions between pups and Het, which contribute to inefficient pup retrieval. Day-by-day analysis showed dynamic changes in goal-related movements in individual animals across genotypes and strains in response to the growing pups. Overall, our approach 1) embraces natural variation in individual mice on different days of pup retrieval behavior, 2) establishes a “gold-standard” manually curated dataset to next build behavioral repertoires using machine learning approaches, and 3) identifies distinct atypical tactile sensory processing in a female mouse model for Rett syndrome.",1591,222,237,24.0

After a single training trial, when the crabs were presented with a food pellet in the target quadrant of the training arena, they were able to form a long-term memory related to the event. This memory was evident at least 24 h after training and was protein-synthesis dependent.

Obligate secondary cavity-nesting has evolved repeatedly across avian lineages, providing a useful comparative context to explore how competition over limited nest cavities shapes aggression and its underlying mechanisms across species. Although evidence from one or another cavity-nesting species suggests that territorial aggression is adaptive in both females and males, this has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. We tested the hypothesis that cavity-nesting generates more robust territorial aggression, in comparison to close relatives with less restrictive nesting strategies. Our focal species were two obligate secondary cavity-nesting species and two related species with more flexible nesting strategies in the same avian family: tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) vs. barn swallow (Hirundo rustica); Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) vs. American robin (Turdus migratorius). We assayed conspecific territorial aggression, and found that cavity-nesting species physically attacked a simulated intruder more often than their close relatives. This pattern held for both females and males. Because territorial aggression is often associated with elevated testosterone, we also hypothesized that cavity-nesting species would exhibit higher testosterone levels in circulation. However, cavity-nesting species did not have higher testosterone in circulation for either sex, despite some correlative evidence that testosterone is associated with higher rates of physical attack in female tree swallows. Our focus on a competitive context that is relevant to both sexes – competition over essential breeding resources – provides a useful comparative framework for co-consideration of proximate and ultimate drivers of reproductive competition in females and males.",1056,50,154,18.0

Both clinical populations are impulsive and exhibit risky decision-making. Drug-associated cues have long been known to facilitate habitual drug-seeking, and the salient audiovisual cues embedded within modern gambling products may like-wise encourage problem gambling. The dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are exquisitely sensitive to drugs of abuse, uncertain rewards, and reward-paired cues, and may therefore be the common neural substrate mediating synergistic features of both disorders. To test this hypothesis, we first gained specific inhibitory control over VTA dopamine neurons by transducing a floxed inhibitory DREADD (AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry) in rats expressing Cre recombinase in tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. We then trained rats in our cued rat gambling task (crGT), inhibiting dopamine neurons throughout task acquisition and performance, before allowing them to self-administer cocaine in the same diurnal period as crGT sessions. The trajectories of addiction differ in women and men, and the dopamine system may differ functionally across the sexes, therefore we used male and female rats here. We found that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons decreased cue-induced risky choice and reduced motor impulsivity in males, but surprisingly, enhanced risky decision making in females. Inhibiting VTA dopamine neurons also prevented cocaine-induced deficits in decision making in both sexes, but nevertheless drove all animals to consume more cocaine. These findings show that chronic dampening of dopamine signalling can have both protective and deleterious effects on addiction-relevant behaviours, depending on biological sex and dependent variable of interest.",1753,125,649,15.0

In this study we determined the calibration curves for foragers of the two Asian honey bee species, A. florea and A. cerana, in two different natural environments with clear differences in the vegetation conditions and hence visual contrast. We found that the dense vegetation condition (with higher contrast) elicited a more rapid increase in the waggle phase duration with distance than the sparse vegetation in A. florea but not in A. cerana. Visual contrast did not affect the perception of the food reward, measured as the number of dance circuits produced per distance, in both species.

One way to test the nature of observers’ representation is to manipulate the structure of the scene as they move through it and measure which aspects of performance are significantly affected and which are not. We recorded the routes that participants took in virtual mazes to reach previously-viewed targets. The mazes were either physically realizable or impossible (the latter contained ‘wormholes’ that altered the layout of the scene without any visible change at that moment). We found that participants could usually find the shortest route between remembered objects even in physically impossible environments, despite the gross failures in pointing that an earlier study showed are evident in the physically impossible environment. In the physically impossible conditions, the choice made at a junction was influenced to a greater extent by whether that choice had, in the past, led to the discovery of a target (compared to a shortest-distance prediction). In the physically realizable mazes, on the other hand, junction choices were determined more by the shortest distance to the target. This pattern of results is compatible with the idea of a graph-like representation of space that can include information about previous success or failure for traversing each edge and also information about the distance between nodes.

This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups (20 groups of 46-91 animals). We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P=0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P&lt;0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P=0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P&lt;0.0001).

Behavioural plasticity can allow individuals to do so instantaneously, but why individuals vary in this respect is poorly understood. Although personality and cognitive traits are often hypothesised to influence plasticity, the effects reported are highly inconsistent, which we hypothesise is because ecological context is usually not considered.Here we explore the roles of individual cognitive and personality variation – assayed using standard tasks for inhibitory control, a measure of self-control, and ‘reactive-proactive’ personality axis (RPPA), respectively – in driving foraging plasticity, and asked how these effects varied across two experimentally manipulated ecological contexts: food value and predation risk.After great tits (Parus major) had initially been trained to retrieve high value food hidden in sand, they were then simultaneously offered the hidden food and an alternative food choice on the surface, that was either high or low value. Their choices were further examined under high and low perceived predation risk treatments. Individuals’ choices were classified in terms of whether they continued to forage on the hidden but familiar food source, or instead switched to the new visible food source. We defined the latter option as the plastic response.Our assays captured consistent differences among individuals in foraging behaviour. Both inhibitory control and exploration influenced whether birds switched from the familiar but hidden food source to the new alternative visible food on the surface. These effects depended on the relative value of the food items available and on the perceived level of predation risk, but also on the time scale over which the response was measured.Our results demonstrate how an executive cognitive function and one specific personality axis can simultaneously influence plasticity in a key functional behaviour. That their effects on foraging were primarily observed as interactions with food value or predation risk treatments also suggest that the population level consequences of behavioural mechanisms, such as these, may only be revealed across key ecological conditions or gradients.",745,83,158,43.0

Here, we developed an in situ roost-like novel environment assay for tree-cave roosting bats. We repeatedly tested 52 individuals of the migratory bat species, Pipistrellus nathusii, across 24 hours, to examine the role of echolocation when crawling through a maze-type arena and test for consistent intra-specific variation in sensory-based exploration. We reveal a strong correlation between echolocation call activity and spatial activity.

Acoustic exploration was correlated with other exploratory behaviors, but not with emergence latency.

One assumed behavioural role is to detect self-motion and to counteract involuntary course deviations, extensively investigated in tethered walking or flying flies. In free flight, however, any deviation from a straight course is signalled by both the visual system as well as by proprioceptive mechanoreceptors called ‘halteres’, which are the equivalent of the vestibular system in vertebrates. Therefore, it is yet unclear to what extent motion vision contributes to course control, or whether straight flight is completely controlled by proprioceptive feedback from the halteres. To answer these questions, we genetically rendered flies motion-blind by blocking their primary motion-sensitive neurons and quantified their free-flight performance. We found that such flies have difficulties maintaining a straight flight trajectory, much like control flies in the dark. By unilateral wing clipping, we generated an asymmetry in propulsory force and tested the ability of flies to compensate for this perturbation. While wild-type flies showed a remarkable level of compensation, motion-blind animals exhibited pronounced circling behaviour. Our results therefore unequivocally demonstrate that motion vision is necessary to fly straight under realistic conditions.",655,121,182,20.0

Zebrafish, a highly social fish, is increasingly being used in behavioural neuroscience, but it is not known whether it displays conditional approach. In the predator inspection task, animals are observed in a tank with a refuge in one extremity, and an animated image of a predator in the other extremity, with a mirror positioned in parallel to the tank, simulating a perfectly reciprocating conspecific. In Experiment 1, animals spent more time in an inspection zone when the image was turned on, but also displayed more erratic swimming, suggesting cooperation under fear. In Experiment 2, animals spent more time inspecting predators when the mirror was parallel to the tank (“cooperating mirror”) than when the mirror was in an angle (“defecting mirror”), suggesting retaliatory behaviour; in both conditions, animals displayed more freezing and erratic swimming. In Experiment 3, no changes in behaviour were observed, regardless of mirror position, when the image was turned off, suggesting that the choice of specific zones in Experiment 2 was not due to shoaling tendencies. These results suggest that predator inspection is associated with conditional approach, while at the same time inducing fear-like behaviour in the animal.",1163,177,266,24.0

McIvor, Alex Thornton",2020.12.15.422933;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422933,"Animals create diverse structures, both individually and cooperatively, using materials from their environment. One striking example are the nests birds build for reproduction, which protect the offspring from external stressors such as predators and temperature, promoting reproductive success. To construct a nest successfully, birds need to make various decisions, for example regarding the nest material and their time budgets. To date, research has focused mainly on species where one sex is primarily responsible for building the nest. In contrast, the cooperative strategies of monogamous species in which both sexes contribute to nest building are poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of both sexes in nest building and fitness correlates of behaviour in wild, monogamous jackdaw pairs (Corvus monedula). We show that both partners contributed to nest building and behaved similarly, with females and males present in the nest box for a comparable duration and transporting material to the nest equally often. However, while females spent more time constructing the nest, males tended to invest more time in vigilance, potentially as a means of coping with competition for nest cavities. These findings suggest a moderate degree of division of labour, which may facilitate cooperation. Moreover, some aspects of behaviour were related to proxies of reproductive success (lay date and egg volume). Females that contributed relatively more to bringing material laid earlier clutches and pairs that spent less time together in the nest box had larger eggs. Thus, selection pressures may act on how nest building pairs spend their time and cooperatively divide the labour. We conclude that cooperative nest building in birds could be associated with monogamy and obligate biparental care, and provides a vital but relatively untapped context through which to study the evolution of cooperation.HighlightsIn wild monogamous jackdaws, mates behaved similarly and cooperated to build their nest.Females built more and called more frequently; males tended to be more vigilant.Females that contributed relatively more to transporting nest material laid earlier clutches.Pairs that spent more time together in the nest box had smaller eggs.Cooperation may be crucial in light of obligate biparental care and nest site competition.",978,98,233,42.0

In zebrafish, the centrifugal pathway runs between the olfactory bulb and the neural retina, originating at the terminalis neuron in the olfactory bulb. Any changes in the ambient odor of a fish’s environment warrants a change in visual sensitivity and can trigger mating-like behavior in males due to increased GnRH signaling in the terminalis neuron. Behavioral experiments to study this phenomenon are commonly conducted in a controlled environment where a video of the fish is recorded over time before and after the application of chemicals to the water. Given the subtleties of behavioral change, trained biologists are currently required to annotate such videos as part of a study. This process of manually analyzing the videos is time-consuming, requires multiple experts to avoid human error/bias and cannot be easily crowdsourced on the Internet. Machine learning algorithms from computer vision, on the other hand, have proven to be effective for video annotation tasks because they are fast, accurate, and, if designed properly, can be less biased than humans. In this work, we propose to automate the entire process of analyzing videos of behavior changes in zebrafish by using tools from computer vision, relying on minimal expert supervision. The overall objective of this work is to create a generalized tool to predict animal behaviors from videos using state-of-the-art deep learning models, with the dual goal of advancing understanding in biology and engineering a more robust and powerful artificial information processing system for biologists.",996,95,257,18.0

Here we describe a novel deep learning algorithm that classifies dog behavior at sub-second resolution using commercial pet activity monitors. We built machine learning training databases from over 5,000 videos of over 2,500 dogs and ran the algorithms in production on over 11 million days of device data. We then surveyed project participants representing 10,550 dogs, they provided us 163,110 event responses to validate real-world detection of eating and drinking behavior. The resultant algorithm displayed a sensitivity and specificity for detecting drinking behavior (0.949 and 0.999, respectively) and eating behavior (0.988, 0.983). We also demonstrated detection of licking, petting, rubbing, scratching, and sniffing. We show that the devices’ position on the collar has no measurable impact on performance. In production, users reported a true positive rate of 95.3% for eating (among 1,514 users), and of 94.9% (among 1,491 users) for drinking.

Understanding individual-level plasticity, however, requires the tracking of known individuals. We compared flight-initiation distances (FID) and distances fled (DF) from approaches by a human across urban and non-urban populations of individually-marked Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) in southern California. The urban population is more tolerant to people as evidenced by attenuated FIDs and DFs relative to non-urban birds. Although individual urban birds either habituated or sensitized to repeated approaches, there was no significant pattern at the population level.

However, general long-term activity patterns for both hungry and satiated flies in conditions of foraging remain to be better understood. Similarly, little is known about how chronic contact chemosensory stimulation affects locomotion. To address these questions, we have developed a novel, simplistic fly activity tracking setup – the Panopticon. Using a 3D-printed Petri dish inset, our assay allows recording of walking behaviour, of several flies in parallel, with all arena surfaces covered by a uniform substrate layer. We tested two constellations of providing food: i) in single patches, and ii) omnipresent within the substrate layer. Fly tracking is done with FIJI, further assessment, analysis and presentation is done with a custom-built MATLAB analysis framework. We find that starvation history leads to a long-lasting reduction in locomotion, as well as a delayed place preference for food patches not driven by immediate hunger motivation.",1160,57,307,35.0

Many studies of animal social networks therefore attempt to disentangle social preferences from spatial preferences or restrictions. As such, there are a large number of techniques with which to test whether results from network analysis can be explained by random interactions, or interactions driven by similarities in space use. Selecting which of these methods to use will require determining to what extent space might influence social structure. Here we present a simple method (Social Spatial Community Assignment Test) to quantify the similarity between social and spatial group structure. We then apply this method to both simulated and empirical data of social interactions to demonstrate that it can successfully tease apart social and spatial explanations for groups. We first show that it can resolve the relative importance of space and social preferences in three simulated datasets in which interaction patterns are driven purely by space use, purely by social preferences or a mixture of the two. We then apply it to empirical data from a long-term study of free-ranging house mice. We find that while social structure is similar to spatial structure, there is still evidence for individuals possessing social preferences, with the importance of these preferences fluctuating between seasons. Our method provides a robust way of assessing the overlap between spatial and social structure, which will be invaluable to researchers when investigating the underlying drivers of social structure in wild populations.",878,82,262,20.0

The rats were assigned into five groups: two control groups (CG1 and CG2) and three experimental groups (EG1, EG2, EG3). CG1 rats received phosphate buffered saline (PBS), CG2 received MK-801 (as a model for schizophrenia), EG1, EG2, EG3 received orally 5 × 103 single T. gondii oocysts strain of type I, type II and type III respectively. After infection, all the five groups of rats were tested for T. gondii antibodies at two weeks post-infection (PI). Behavioural tests of exploratory activity (open field) and spatial learning and memory retention (Morris water maze) were performed on the ninth and tenth weeks PI followed by histological staining of rat brain. T. gondii IgM antibodies were detected in EG1, EG2 and EG3, but not in CG1 and CG2. The behaviour results demonstrated that rats from CG2, EG1, EG2 and EG3 had increased in their locomotor activities and memory deficits compared to control, while learning remain intact.

Behavioural phenotypes are typically measured through standardized testing paradigms and one frequently used paradigm is the novel object test. In novel object tests, animals are exposed to new (unknown) objects and their reaction is quantified. When repeating trials to assess the temporal consistency of individual differences, researchers face the dilemma of whether to use the same or different ‘novel’ objects, since the same stimulus can result in habituation, while exposure to different objects can result in context-dependent responses. We performed a quantitative assessment of 254 effect sizes from 113 studies on novel-object trials to evaluate the properties of this testing paradigm, in particular the effect of object novelty and time interval between novel-object trials on estimates of individual consistency. We found an increase of sample sizes and an increase of estimates of repeatabilities with time. The vast majority of short-term studies (&lt;one month) used different novel objects, while long-term studies (&gt;one month) used either the same or different novel objects about equally often. The average estimate for individual consistency was r = 0.47 (short-term r = 0.52, long-term r = 0.44). Novelty, time interval between trials and their interaction together explained only 3% of the total heterogeneity. Overall, novelobject trials reliably estimate individual differences in behaviour, but results were very heterogeneous even within the same study species, suggesting susceptibility to unknown details in testing conditions. Most studies that measure novel-object responses in association with food label the trait as neophobia, while novel-object trials in a neutral context are labelled variously as boldness/shyness, exploratory behaviour or neophobia/neophilia. Neophobia/neophilia is also the term most specific to novel object presentations. To avoid ambiguity, we suggest object neophobia/neophilia as the most specific label for novel-object responses.",907,50,143,37.0

Female ornaments are now receiving more attention, although their roles in mating decision are still less well understood, especially considering cases in which colourful ornaments are expressed by both sexes. In this study, we analysed whether female skin colouration (luminance and redness of the face and hindquarters) influenced male mate choice and sexual behaviours in relation to intra-cycle (cycle phase), inter-cycle (number of consecutive cycles, conceptive nature of the cycle), and inter-individual (age, social rank, weight, and parity) variation in a captive population of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Males did not preferentially choose darker/redder females. Moreover, males did not appear to use female skin colouration to apportion their mating efforts on the most fertile period of the menstrual cycle or during cycles that lead to conception, or to discriminate between females. To our knowledge, our study is among the few to report a lack of male choice for female colouration in a species where both sexes potentially display ornamentation. While female colouration appeared to contain information about intra-cycle, inter-cycle, and inter-individual variation in fecundity, this study further demonstrates that this trait may not have been sexually selected and that males mated regardless of such variation across females.

Understanding the relationship between sources of phenotypic variation, i.e. genetic variation and plasticity, with selection surfaces improves our ability to predict a population’s ability to adapt to a changing environment and our understanding of how selection has shaped phenotypes. Here, we estimated the (co)variances among three different behaviors (activity, aggression, and anti-predator response) in a natural population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using multi-response generalized mixed effects models, we divided the phenotypic covariance matrix into among- and within-individual matrices. The among-individual covariances includes genetic and permanent environmental covariances (e.g. developmental plasticity) and is predicted to align with selection. Simultaneously, we estimated the within-individual (co)variances, which include reversible phenotypic plasticity. To determine whether genetic variation, plasticity and selection align in multivariate space we calculated the dimensions containing the greatest among-individual variation and the dimension in which most plasticity was expressed (i.e. the dominant eigenvector for the among- and within-individual covariance matrices respectively). We estimated selection coefficients based on survival estimates from a mark-recapture model. Alignment between the dominant eigenvectors of behavioural variation and the selection gradient was estimated by calculating the angle between them, with an angle of 0 indicating perfect alignment. The angle between vectors ranged from 68° to 89°, indicating that genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and selection are misaligned in this population. This misalignment could be due to the behaviors being close to their fitness optima, which is supported by low evolvabilities, or because of low selection pressure on these behaviors.",463,48,95,26.0

In this study, I investigated territorial interactions between male Eurasian Scops Owls that occupy territories in a densely-packed area. The single-note hoot of the Scops Owl is generally assumed to be highly repeatable, however extensive recording of male-male interactions identified previously unrecognized variation in the hoots’ structure. Male Scops Owls gave hoots at a frequency lower than usual when engaging in short-distance contests with neighbouring males. Within-subject analysis revealed that the caller’s average hoot frequency was positively correlated with the distance from its rival. During contests, males gradually reduced their hoot frequency as they approached one another, perhaps reflecting changes in the degree of escalation. Male Scops Owls reduced their hoot frequency immediately after the rival initiated countersinging, and returned to their usual frequency range at the end of the contest. These findings demonstrate that vocal modulation is pervasive in social contexts in the Scops Owl, and suggests that individuals have full voluntary control of the structure of their vocalizations. This study confirms in part the findings of other authors’ experimental work, where male owls adjusted their vocal frequency when challenged by an opponent. However, that study suggested that vocal frequency would encode information about the caller’s body weight. In contrast, the present study revealed context-dependent fluctuations in hoot frequency, which may suggest that the hoot of the Scops Owl dynamically reflects the current motivational state of the caller during the contest.",447,127,133,28.0

The challenge is to discover the vocabulary, the volatile odorant chemicals that enable communication across phylogenies and to translate them to physiological, behavioural and ecological function. Olfactory receptors (ORs) interface animals with airborne odorants. Expression of single ORs in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) makes it possible to interrogate ORs with synthetic chemicals and to identify cognate ligands that convey olfactory information.Results The cosmopolitan strain of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster has accompanied the human expansion out of Africa, more than ten thousand years ago. These flies are strictly anthropophilic and depend on human resources and housing for survival, particularly in colder climate zones. Curiously, humans sense the scent of a single fly, and more precisely the female pheromone (Z)-4 undecenal (Z4-11Al), at 10 ng/mL (0.06 µmol/L). A screening of all functional human ORs in a HEK-293 assay provides an explanation for this astounding sensitivity, as it shows that OR10A6, one of the most highly expressed human ORs, is specifically tuned to Z4-11Al. Chemical analysis of fly effluvia confirms that cosmopolitan D. melanogaster females release Z4-11Al, while females of an African fly strain from Zimbabwe release a 1:3-blend of Z4-11Al and (Z)-4 nonenal (Z4-9Al). Interestingly, a blend of Z4-9Al and Z4-11Al produces a different aroma than the the single compounds, which is why we readily differentiate cosmopolitan and Zimbabwe flies by nose.Conclusion That we sensitively and specifically perceive the fly pheromone Z4-11Al suggests that it is a component of human odour scenes. This may have afforded a sensory drive during adaptation of commensal flies to human habitats and selected for a role of Z4-11Al in fly aggregation and premating communication. Screening ORs for key ligands leads to the discovery of messenger chemicals that enable chemical communication among and betwen vertebrate and invertebrate animals.",1426,68,280,26.0

Honey bees use a unique form of communication, the waggle dance, to inform nestmates about the location of food sources. However, as in many other animals, experienced individuals often ignore this social information and prefer to rely on prior experiences, i.e. private information. The neurosensory factors that drive the decision to use social information are not yet understood. Here we test whether the decision to use social dance information or private information is linked to gene expression differences in different parts of the nervous system. We trained bees to collect food from sugar water feeders and observed whether they utilize social or private information when exposed to dances for a new food source. We performed transcriptome analysis of four brain parts critical for cognition: the subesophageal ganglion, the central brain, the mushroom bodies, and the antennal lobes but, unexpectedly, detected no differences between social or private information users. In contrast, we found 413 differentially expressed genes in the antennae, suggesting that variation in sensory perception mediate the decision to use social information. Social information users were characterized by the upregulation of dopamine and serotonin genes while private information users upregualted several genes coding for odor perception. These results highlight that decision making in honey bees might also depend on peripheral processes of perception rather than higher-order brain centers of information integration.",1416,167,326,35.0

Cannabinoids also exhibit potential therapeutic functions in Drosophila melanogaster, or fruit fly that lacks cannabinoid receptors. However, it remains unclear whether cannabinoids affect food consumption and metabolism in a cannabinoid receptors-independent manner in flies. In this study, we systematically investigated pharmacological functions of various cannabinoids in modulating food preference and consumption in flies. We show that flies display preferences for consuming cannabinoids, independent of their sensory functions. Interestingly, phyto- and endo- cannabinoids exhibit an inhibitory effect on food intake. Unexpectedly, the non-selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 attenuates the suppression of food intake by endocannabinoids. Moreover, the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and its metabolite inhibit food intake and promote resistance to starvation, possibly through reduced lipid metabolism. Thus, this study has provided insights into a pharmacological role of cannabinoids in feeding behaviors using an adult Drosophila model.",1041,138,169,39.0

Recently, even the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) recognised the unique nature of chimpanzee nut-cracking by making it the first animal behaviour to be awarded UN-protected status (Picheta, 2020). So far, only chimpanzees, capuchins and macaques have been observed using tools to crack nuts in the wild (Boesch &amp; Boesch, 1990; Gumert, Kluck, &amp; Malaivijitnond, 2009; Ottoni &amp; Mannu, 2001). However, the learning mechanisms behind this behaviour, and the extent of nut-cracking in other primate species are still unknown. The aim of this study was two-fold. First, we aimed to examine whether other great ape species would develop nut-cracking when provided with all the tools and motivation to do so. Second, we wanted to examine the mechanisms behind the emergence of nut-cracking in a naïve sample. Orangutans (Pongo abelii; pygmaeus) have not been observed cracking nuts in the wild, despite having the second most extensive tool-use repertoire of the great apes (after chimpanzees), having the materials for the behaviour in the wild (albeit rarely) and possessing flexible problem-solving capacities. Therefore, orangutans are a valid candidate species for the investigation of the development of nut-cracking. Four nut-cracking-naïve orangutans at Leipzig zoo (Pongo abelii; Mage=16; age range=10-19; 4F; at time of testing) were provided with nuts and hammers but were not demonstrated the nut-cracking behavioural form, in order to control for the role of copying social learning in the acquisition of this behaviour. Additionally, we report data from a previously unpublished study by one of the authors (MF) with eight orangutans housed at Zürich zoo (10 Pongo abelii and two Pongo pygmaeus; Mage=14; age range =2-30; 5F; at time of testing) that followed a similar testing paradigm. Out of the twelve orangutans across both testing institutions, at least four individuals, one from Leipzig (Pongo abelii) and three from Zürich (Pongo abelii; pygmaeus), spontaneously expressed nut-cracking with a wooden hammer. These results suggest that the behavioural form of nut-cracking using hammer tools can emerge in orangutans when required through individual learning combined, in some cases, with non-copying social learning mechanisms.",1105,170,330,32.0

However, to what degree tail use is preferred over autopod prehension has been largely neglected. Using an indoor experimental set-up, where chameleons had to cross gaps of varying distances, we tested the effect of substrate diameter and roughness on tail use in Chamaeleo calyptratus. Our results show that when crossing greater distances, C. calyptratus is more likely to use its tail for additional stability. The animals were able to cross greater distances (up to 1 75 times the shoulder-hip length) on perches with a rougher surface. We saw that depending on the distance of the gap, chameleons would change how they use their prehensile tails when crossing. With shorter gaps the tails either do not touch, or only touch the perch without coiling around it. With larger distances the tails are fully coiled around the perch, and with the largest distances additionally they reposition the hind legs, shifting them towards the end of the perch. Males were able to cross relatively greater distances than females, likely due to their larger size and strength.",1233,122,255,16.0

Nectars are composed of a plethora of nutritionally valuable compounds but also hundreds of secondary metabolites (SMs) whose ecological role is still not completely understood. Here we performed a set of behavioural experiments to study whether five ubiquitous nectar non-protein amino acids (NPAAs: β-alanine, GABA, citrulline, ornithine and taurine) interact with gustation, feeding preference, and learning and memory in the pollinator Apis mellifera. We showed that harnessed foragers were unable to discriminate NPAAs from water when only accessing antennal chemo-tactile information and that freely moving bees did not exhibit innate feeding preferences for NPAA-laced sucrose solutions. Also, dietary consumption of NPAAs did not alter food consumption or longevity in caged bees over 10 days. Taken together our data suggest that ecologically relevant concentrations of NPAAs did not alter nectar palatability to bees. Olfactory conditioning assays showed that honey bees were more likely to learn a scent when it signalled a sucrose reward containing either β-alanine or GABA, and that GABA also enhanced specific memory retention. Conversely, when ingested two hours prior to conditioning, GABA, β-alanine, and taurine weakened bees’ acquisition performances but not specific memory retention, which was enhanced in the case of β-alanine and taurine. Neither citrulline nor ornithine affected learning and memory. Our study suggests that NPAAs in nectars may represent a cooperative strategy adopted by plants to attract beneficial pollinators, while simultaneously enhancing pollen transfer among conspecific flowers. Future work should validate these results in more ecological scenarios and extend the study to as many nectar SMs as possible, alone and in combination, as well as to other species of pollinators.",876,54,154,29.0

Oxytocin (OXT) is known for its role in initiation of maternal care, but whether OXT can rapidly influence maternal behavior or ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs; above 50 kHz) has not been examined. To test for rapid effects of OXT, California mouse mothers were administered an acute intranasal (IN) dose of OXT (0.8 IU/kg) followed by a separation test with three phases: habituation with pups in a new testing chamber, separation via a wire mesh, and finally reunion with pups. We measured maternal care, maternal USVs, and pup USVs. In mothers, we primarily observed simple sweep USVs, a short downward sweeping call around 50 kHz, and in pups we only observed pup whines, a long call with multiple harmonics ranging from 20 kHz to 50 kHz. We found that IN OXT rapidly and selectively enhanced the normal increase in maternal simple sweep USVs when mothers had physical access to pups (habituation and reunion), but not when mothers were physically separated from pups. Maternal-pup USVs were correlated upon reunion, but IN OXT did not influence this correlation. Finally, mothers given IN OXT showed a more positive change in retrievals/carrying and greater total maternal care upon reunion. Behavioral changes were specific to maternal behaviors (e.g. retrievals) as mothers given IN OXT did not differ from controls in stress-related behaviors (e.g. freezing). Overall, these findings highlight the rapid effects and context-dependent effect a single dose of IN OXT has on both maternal USV production and offspring care.",715,205,185,41.0

This strategy is considered to be adaptive in case of unpredictable and/or poor environments in which it would guarantee that at least larger nestlings will fledge. Brood reduction is the usual outcome in asynchronously hatched broods since first-hatched nestlings are larger and get a disproportionately larger share of the food delivered by parents, often leading the youngest nestling to starve to death soon after hatching. However, we still do not know the proximate mechanisms of such brood reduction. One possibility is that the smallest nestling is not fed because larger nestlings outcompete it, which implies that nestlings control resource allocation. Alternatively, parents might actively ignore the persistent begging from their smallest nestling, which would involve that parents control food allocation. To determine whether parents or nestlings ultimately induce brood reduction in this situation, we experimentally created asynchronous broods of Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) nestlings and quantified food allocation by parents in two different situations: when sibling competition was allowed and, alternatively, when competition was prevented by physically separating nestlings within the nests by using wooden barriers. Our results showed that experimentally introduced smaller nestlings received less food than their larger nestmates both when competition among nestlings was allowed and when it was prevented. When adult males and females are considered separately, males fed the smallest nestling less often regardless of whether sibling competition was allowed or not, but adult females showed no differences. We can conclude that the smallest nestling starves mainly because parents actively ignore its begging. The higher competitive ability of the larger nestlings seem to have little effect given that although the smallest nestling is fed at a higher rate when physical interactions are prevented by the wooden barrier than when not, this difference is not significant. These findings suggest that parents rather than nestlings have the main control over food allocation.",567,56,119,22.0

What mechanisms underlie this linearity of the dominance hierarchy is under debate. Linearity is often attributed to cognitively sophisticated processes, such as transitive inference and eavesdropping. An alternative explanation is that it develops via the winner-loser effect. This effect implies that after a fight has been decided the winner is more likely to win again, and the loser is more likely to lose again. Although it has been shown that dominance hierarchies may develop via the winner-loser effect, the degree of linearity of such hierarchies is unknown.The aim of the present study is to investigate whether a similar degree of linearity, like in real animals, may emerge as a consequence of the winner-loser effect and the socio-spatial structure of group members. For this purpose, we use the model DomWorld, in which agents group and compete and the outcome of conflicts are self-reinforcing. Here dominance hierarchies are shown to emerge. In the model, we apply analytical methods previously used in a study on dominance in real hens including an analysis of behaviourial dynamics and network triad motifs.We show that when in the complete model one parameter, representing the intensity of aggression, was set high, the model reproduced the high linearity and many patterns of hierarchical development typical of groups of hens. Yet, when omitting from the model the winner-loser effect or spatial location of individuals, this resemblance decreased markedly.Our results demonstrate that the spatial structure and the winner-loser effect provide a plausible alternative for hierarchical linearity to processes that are cognitively more sophisticated. Further research should determine whether the winner-loser effect and spatial structure of group members also explains the characteristics of hierarchical development in other species.",542,58,175,31.0

We trained artificial neural networks to estimate fundamental frequency from simulated cochlear representations of natural sounds. The best-performing networks replicated many characteristics of human pitch judgments. To probe how our ears and environment shape these characteristics, we optimized networks given altered cochleae or sound statistics. Human-like behavior emerged only when cochleae had high temporal fidelity and when models were optimized for natural sounds. The results suggest pitch perception is critically shaped by the constraints of natural environments in addition to those of the cochlea, illustrating the use of contemporary neural networks to reveal underpinnings of behavior.",1724,189,908,57.0

Liberation of the trapped rat resulted either in social contact, or in liberation into a separate compartment. Additionally, a condition was tested in which both rats could freely move in two separate compartments and lever pressing resulted in social contact. When partners were not trapped, rats were more motivated to press the lever for opening the door than in either of the trapped configurations. Contrary to our expectation, the trapped configuration resulted in a reduced motivation to act. Early postnatal stress (24h maternal deprivation on postnatal day 3) did not affect behavior in the liberation task.

Manually labelling individual insects in a video is labour-intensive. Automated tracking social insects is particularly challenging: (1) individuals are small and similar in appearance; (2) frequent interactions with each other cause severe and long-term occlusion. We propose a detection and tracking framework for ants by: (1) adopting a two-stage object detection framework using ResNet-50 as backbone and coding the position of regions of interest to locate ants accurately; (2) using the ResNet model to develop the appearance descriptors of ants; (3) constructing long-term appearance sequences and combining them with motion information to achieve online tracking. To validate our method, we build a video database of ant colony captured in both indoor and outdoor scenes. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 95.7% mMOTA and 81.1% mMOTP in indoor videos, 81.8% mMOTA and 81.9% mMOTP in outdoor videos.

But before analysis, each insect needs to be tracked separately in a video. Obviously, that is a time-consuming and labor-intensive work. In this manuscript, we introduce a detection and tracking framework that can automatically track the movement of ants in a video scene. The software first uses a residual network to detect the positions of ants, then learns the appearance descriptor of each ant as appearance information via another residual network. Furthermore, we obtain motion information of each ant by using the Kalman filter. Combining with appearance and motion information, we can accurately track every ant in the ant colony. We validate the performance of our framework using 4 indoor and 5 outdoor videos, including multiple ants.

Using rodents, direct manipulation of stress-associated hormone responses can be achieved with established pharmacologic models for the assessment of antidepressant and anxiolytic therapeutics. Here, chronic oral corticosterone-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is used to assess the relevance of drug-induced glucocorticoid release on the acute, post-acute, and long-term effects of psilocybin in male C57BL/6J mice. In these studies, psilocybin-induced acute anxiogenesis was found to be correlated to post-acute anxiolysis in a dose-dependent manner. Psilocybin also displayed acute increases in plasma corticosterone, but a post-acute anxiolytic effect in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Both effects were lost when psilocybin was administered in animals pre-exposed to chronic oral corticosterone. A similar long-term interaction between chronic corticosterone and psilocybin administration was observed in an open field test occurring one week after drug administration. Psilocybin administration alone led to more time spent in the center of the arena, but animals spent less time in the center with chronic corticosterone exposure. Intriguingly, these interactive effects were absent in animals exposed to brief isoflurane anesthesia after drug treatment. Overall, these experiments identify acute glucocorticoid release as a relevant biological modifier for the post-acute and long-term behavioral effects of psilocybin in mice. Rodent studies are thus suggested as a tractable means to address neuroendocrine mechanisms supporting context-dependent psychedelic effects in mammalian species.",1625,386,794,26.0

Just before decision, orientation information extracted from fast cortical dynamics more closely resembles concurrent psychophysical measurements than single neuron orientation tuning curves.

However, the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying these stress coping style differences in learning are unknown. Further, while a number of neuroplasticity-related genes have been associated with alternative stress coping styles, it is unclear if these genes may bias the development of conditioned behavioral responses to stressful stimuli, and if so, which brain regions are involved. Here, we trained adult zebrafish to associate a naturally aversive olfactory cue with a given context. Next, we investigated if expression of two neural plasticity and neurotransmission-related genes (npas4a and gabbr1a) were associated with the contextual fear conditioning differences between proactive and reactive stress coping styles. Reactive zebrafish developed a stronger conditioned fear response and showed significantly higher npas4a expression in the medial and lateral zones of the dorsal telencephalon (Dm, Dl), and the supracommissural nucleus of the ventral telencephalon (Vs).

Using artificial laboratory selection for divergent phasing of emergence of adults from pupae, our group has derived populations of Drosophila melanogaster which are early and late chronotypes for eclosion rhythm. Several circadian rhythm characteristics of these populations have since been described. We hypothesized that our selection protocol has inadvertently resulted in selection for masking, a non-clock phenomenon, in the early chronotype due to the placement of our selection window (which includes the lights-ON transition). Based on theoretical predictions and previous studies on our populations, we designed experiments to discriminate between enhanced masking to light versus circadian clock mediated changes in determining enhanced emergence in the morning window in our early chronotypes. Using a series of phase-shift protocols, LD-DD transition, and T-cycle experiments, we find that our early chronotypes have evolved positive masking, and their apparent entrained phases are largely contributed by masking. Through skeleton T-cycle experiments, we find that in addition to the evolution of greater masking, our early chronotypes have also evolved advanced phase of entrainment. Furthermore, our study systematically outlines experimental approaches to examine relative contributions of clock versus non-clock control of an entrained behavior. Although it has previously been suggested that masking may confer an adaptive advantage to organisms, here we provide experimental evidence for the evolution of masking as a mean of phasing of an entrained rhythm that can complement clock control of an entrained behavior.",890,85,200,37.0

In fish, ammonia can cause physical damage, alter its behaviour and even cause death. Exposure to ammonia also increases fish physiological stress, which can be measured through biomarkers. In this study, we analysed the effect of sublethal ammonia concentrations on the behaviour and the oxidative stress of Barbus meridionalis that had been pre-exposed to this compound in the wild. Wild-caught fish from a polluted site (pre-exposed fish) and from an unpolluted site (non-pre-exposed fish) were exposed, under experimental conditions, to total ammonia concentrations (TAN) of 0, 1, 5 and 8 mg/L. Swimming activity, feeding behaviour and oxidative stress response based on biomarkers were analysed. Pre-exposed fish showed both an altered behaviour and an altered oxidative stress response in the control treatment (0 mg/L). Differences in swimming activity were also found as pre-exposed fish swam less. Lower feeding activity (voracity and satiety) and altered response to oxidative stress were also observed at ≥ 1 mg/L TAN. Biomarker results confirmed pre-exposed fish suffer from a reduction in their antioxidant defences and, hence, showed increased oxidative tissue damage. In summary, pre-exposed fish showed more sensitivity to ammonia exposure than fish from a pristine site.",647,61,158,35.0

However, assessing dominance hierarchy can be a time-consuming activity which is potentially impeded by environmental factors, difficulties in the recognition of animals, or through the disturbance of animals during data collection. Here we took advantage of novel devices, Machines for Automated Learning and Testing (MALT), designed primarily to study nonhuman primates’ cognition - to additionally measure the social structure of a primate group. When working on a MALT, an animal can be replaced by another; which could reflect an asymmetric dominance relationship (or could happen by chance). To assess the reliability of our automated method, we analysed a sample of the automated conflicts with video scoring and found that 75% of these replacements include genuine forms of social displacements. We thus first designed a data filtering procedure to exclude events that should not be taken into account when automatically assessing social hierarchies in monkeys. Then, we analysed months of daily use of MALT by 25 semi-free ranging Tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana) and found that dominance relationships inferred from these interactions strongly correlate with the ones derived from observations of spontaneous agonistic interactions collected during the same time period. We demonstrate that this method can be used to assess the evolution of individual social status, as well as group-wide hierarchical stability longitudinally with minimal research labour. Further, it facilitates a continuous assessment of dominance hierarchies, even during unpredictable environmental or challenging social events. Altogether, this study supports the use of MALT as a reliable tool to automatically and dynamically assess social status within groups of nonhuman primates, including juveniles.",634,64,187,25.0

The algorithm employs the following traditional image processing steps: conversion to grayscale, low pass filtering, background subtraction, thresholding, tracking and clustering to detect run of bees that perform waggle dances. The algorithm detected 44,530 waggle events, i.e. one bee waggling in one time frame, which were then clustered into 511 waggle runs. Most of these were concentrated in one section of the hive. The accuracy of the tracking was 90% and a series of metrics like intra-dance variation in angle and duration were found to be consistent with literature.

Previous studies found a preference in rats for releasing restrained or distressed conspecifics over other controls (e.g., empty restrainers or inanimate objects). An empathy account was offered to explain the observed behaviors, claiming subjects were motivated to reduce the distress of others based on a rodent homologue of empathy. An opposing account attributes all previous results to subjects seeking social-contact. To dissociate these two accounts for helping behavior, we presented subject rats with three simultaneous choice alternatives: releasing a restrained conspecific, engaging a non-restrained conspecific, or not socializing. Subjects showed an initial preference for socializing with the non-restrained conspecific, and no preference for helping. This result contradicts the empathy account, but is consistent with the social-contact account of helping behavior.",688,116,179,22.0

In this study, animal single-file movement data ‒serialized order movements generated by simple bottom-up rules of collective movements— are informative and effective observations for the reconstruction of animal social structures using agent-based models. For simulation, artificial 2-dimensional spatial distributions were prepared with the simple assumption of clustered structures of a group. Animals in the group are either independent or dependent agents. Independent agents distribute spatially independently each one another, while dependent agents distribute depending on the distribution of independent agents. Artificial agent spatial distributions aim to represent clustered structures of agent locations ‒a coupling of “core” or “keystone” subjects and “subordinate” or “follower” subjects. Collective movements were simulated following two simple rules, 1) initiators of the movement are randomly chosen, and 2) the next moving agent is always the nearest neighbor of the last moving agents, generating “single-file movement” data. Finally, social networks were visualized, and clustered structures reconstructed using a recent major social network analysis (SNA) algorithm, the Louvain algorithm, for rapid unfolding of communities in large networks. Simulations revealed possible reconstruction of clustered social structures using relatively minor observations of single-file movement, suggesting possible application of single-file movement observations for SNA use in field investigations of wild animals.",1579,173,346,18.0

The extent to which this cognitive mechanism could evolve depends upon individual differences in aversive learning being stable through time, and heritable across generations, yet no published study has quantified the stability of individual differences in aversive learning using the repeatability statistic, R (also known as the intra-class correlation). We assessed the repeatability of aversive learning by conditioning approximately 100 zebrafish (Danio rerio) to avoid a colour cue associated with a mild electric shock. Across eight different colour conditions zebrafish did not show consistent individual differences in aversive learning (R = 0.04). Within conditions, when zebrafish were twice conditioned to the same colour, blue conditioning was more repeatable than green conditioning (R = 0.15 and R = 0.02). In contrast to the low repeatability estimates for aversive learning, zebrafish showed moderately consistent individual differences in colour preference during the baseline period (i.e. prior to aversive conditioning; R ~ 0.45). Overall, aversive learning responses of zebrafish were weak and variable (difference in time spent near the aversive cue &lt;6 seconds per minute), but individual differences in learning ability did not explain substantial variability. We speculate that either the effect of aversive learning was too weak to quantify consistent individual differences, or directional selection might have eroded additive genetic variance. Finally, we discuss how confounded repeatability assays and publication bias could have inflated average estimates of repeatability in animal behaviour publications.Summary Statement Zebrafish exhibit low repeatability (intra-class correlation) in an aversive learning assay possibly due to past selection pressure exhausting genetic variance in this learning trait.",783,112,223,42.0

In this study, we used an auditory oddball paradigm to estimate detection and discrimination thresholds across a wide range of stimuli in guinea pigs. We demonstrate that pupillometry yields reliable detection and discrimination thresholds across a range of simple (tones) and complex (conspecific vocalizations) stimuli; that pupil responses can be robustly evoked using different stimulus contingencies (low-level acoustic changes, or higher level categorical changes); and that pupil responses are modulated by short-term training.

Human neonates and newly-hatched chicks preferentially orient towards face-like stimuli, biological motion, and objects changing speed. In chicks, this enhances exposure to social partners, and subsequent attachment trough filial imprinting. Early preferences are not steady. The preference for stimuli changing speed fades away after three days in chicks. To understand the physiological mechanisms underlying these transient responses, we tested whether the early preferences for objects changing speed can be promoted by thyroid hormone 3,5,3’-triiodothyronine (T3). This hormone determines the start of imprinting’s sensitive period. We found that the preference for objects changing speed can be re-established in female chicks treated with T3. Moreover, day-one chicks treated with an inhibitor of endogenous T3 did not show any preference. These results suggest that the time windows of early predispositions and of high plasticity are controlled by the same molecular mechanisms.",671,70,161,26.0

The “Challenge Hypothesis” proposed by Wingfield and colleagues outlines the existence of a positive feedback relationship between androgen and social challenges (e.g. territorial intrusions) in male vertebrates.

However, it is not known if ACIS KEPTIDE™ attenuates the entry of SARS-CoV2 virus in vivo in lung and kidney tissues, protects health, and prevent death once applied through intranasal route. In our current manuscript, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of SARS-CoV2 (1*106) strongly induced the expression of ACE-2, promoted the entry of virions into the lung and kidney cells, caused acute histopathological toxicities, and mortality (28%). Interestingly, thirty-minutes of pre-treatment with 50 μg/Kg Body weight ACIS normalized the expression of ACE-2 via receptor internalization, strongly mitigated that viral entry, and prevented mortality suggesting its prospect as a prophylactic therapy in the treatment of COVID-19.

However, despite some recent effort, this investigation remains a challenge in a drug choice setting, notably when it comes to delineate the role of goal-directed versus habitual control mechanisms. The goal of this study was to try probing these different mechanisms by comparing response latencies measured during sampling (i.e., only one option is available) and choice trials. A deliberative goal-directed control mechanism predicts a lengthening of latencies during choice whereas a habitual control mechanism predicts no change in latencies. Alternatively, a race-like response competition mechanism, such as that postulated by the behavioral ecology-inspired Sequential Choice Model (SCM), predicts instead a shortening of response latencies during choice compared to sampling. Here we tested the predictions of these different mechanisms by conducting a systematic retrospective analysis of all cocaine versus saccharin choice experiments conducted in rats in our laboratory over the past 12 years. Overall, we found that rats engage a deliberative goal-directed mechanism after limited training, but shift to a SCM-like response selection mechanism after more extended training. The latter finding suggests that habitual control is engaged in a choice setting via a race-like response competition mechanism, and thus, that the SCM is not a general model of choice, as formulated initially, but a specific model of habitual choice.",786,71,205,19.0

In order to successfully discriminate between multiple wavelengths, animals must use at least two photoreceptor types with different spectral sensitivity peaks.Heliconius butterflies have duplicate UV opsin genes, which encode two kinds of photoreceptors with peak sensitivities in the ultraviolet and violet, respectively. In H. erato, the ultraviolet photoreceptor is only expressed in females.Evidence from intracellular recordings suggests female H. erato may be able to discriminate between UV wavelengths, however, this has yet to be tested experimentally.Using an arena with a controlled light setting, we tested the ability of H. erato, and two species lacking the violet receptor, H. melpomene and outgroup Eueides isabella, to discriminate between two ultraviolet wavelengths, 380 and 390 nm, as well as two blue wavelengths, 400 and 436 nm, after being trained to associate each stimulus with a food reward. Wavelength stimuli were presented in varying intensities to rule out brightness as a cue.We found that H. erato females were the only butterflies capable of color vision in the UV range; the other butterflies had an intensity-dependent preference for UV stimuli. Across species, both sexes showed color vision in the blue-range.Models of H. erato color vision suggest that females have an advantage over males in discriminating the inner UV-yellow corolla of Psiguria pollen flowers from the surrounding outer orange petals, while previous models (McCulloch et al. 2017) suggested that H. erato males have an advantage over females in discriminating Heliconius 3-hyroxykynurenine (3-OHK) yellow wing coloration from non-3-OHK yellow wing coloration found in mimics.These results provide some of the first behavioral evidence for UV color discrimination in Heliconius females in the context of foraging, lending support to the hypothesis (Briscoe et al. 2010) that the duplicated UV opsin genes function together in UV color vision.

We developed an agent-based model to investigate how these three factors influence transmission of information within a population. Our model shows that there is an optimal degree of both hostility and mental capacity at which the amount of transmitted information is the largest.

The continuity axiom, central to EUT and its modifications, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the definition of numerical utilities. The axiom requires decision makers to be indifferent between a gamble and a specific probabilistic combination of a more preferred and a less preferred gamble. While previous studies demonstrated that monkeys choose according to combinations of objective reward magnitude and probability, a concept-driven experimental approach for assessing the axiomatically defined conditions for maximizing subjective utility by animals is missing. We experimentally tested the continuity axiom for a broad class of gamble types in four male rhesus macaque monkeys, showing that their choice behavior complied with the existence of a numerical utility measure as defined by the economic theory. We used the numerical quantity specified in the continuity axiom to characterize subjective preferences in a magnitude-probability space. This mapping highlighted a trade-off relation between reward magnitudes and probabilities, compatible with the existence of a utility function underlying subjective value computation. These results support the existence of a numerical utility function able to describe choices, allowing for the investigation of the neuronal substrates responsible for coding such rigorously defined quantity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A common assumption of several economic choice theories is that decisions result from the comparison of subjectively assigned values (utilities). This study demonstrated the compliance of monkey behavior with the continuity axiom of Expected Utility Theory, implying a subjective magnitude-probability trade-off relation which supports the existence of numerical subjective utility directly linked to the theoretical economic framework. We determined a numerical utility measure able to describe choices, which can serve as a correlate for the neuronal activity in the quest for brain structures and mechanisms guiding decisions.",1088,1557,299,32.0

Ram, Supratim Sengupta",2020.05.05.077131;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.077131,"Societies rely on individual contributions to sustain public goods that benefit the entire community. Several mechanisms, that specify how individuals change their decisions based on past experiences, have been proposed to explain how altruists are not outcompeted by selfish counterparts. A key aspect of such strategy updates involves a comparison of an individual’s latest payoff with that of a random neighbour. In reality, both the economic and social milieu often shapes cooperative behaviour. We propose a new decision heuristic, where the propensity of an individual to cooperate depends on the local strategy environment in which she is embedded as well as her wealth relative to that of her neighbours. Our decision-making model allows cooperation to be sustained and also explains the results of recent experiments on social dilemmas in dynamic networks. Final cooperation levels depend only on the extent to which the strategy environment influences altruistic behaviour but are largely unaffected by network restructuring. However, the extent of wealth inequality in the community is affected by a subtle interplay between the environmental influence on a person’s decision to contribute and the likelihood of reshaping social ties, with wealth-inequality levels rising with increasing likelihood of network restructuring in some situations.",1392,123,327,17.0

In a second preference test, on five consecutive days with two (week 1) or three (week 2) trials, twelve mice had to choose between one arm containing bedding mixed with millet and one containing only bedding. This test design resembled a simple learning test (learn where to find the rewarded and the unrewarded arm on the basis of spatial, olfactory and visual cues).In both experiments, mice took only a few seconds per trial to run the maze and make their choice. However, in both experiments mice failed to show any preference for one of the arms. Instead, they alternated choices. We therefore believe the T-maze test to be rather unsuitable to test preference or learning behaviour with C57BL/6J mice.",724,164,199,27.0

Animals thus face a trade-off between gathering too little and too much information and, accordingly, actively adapt sensory input through motor control. Echolocating animals provide the unique opportunity to study the dynamics of adaptive sensing in naturally behaving animals, since every change in the outgoing echolocation signal directly affects information acquisition and the perception of the dynamic acoustic scene. Here we investigated the flexibility with which bats dynamically adapt information acquisition depending on a task. We recorded the echolocation signals of wild-caught Western barbastelle bats (Barbastella barbastellus) while flying through an opening, drinking on the wing, landing on a wall, and capturing prey. We show that the echolocation signal sequences during target approach differed in a task-dependent manner; bats started target approach earlier and increased information update rate more when the task became increasingly difficult, and bats also adjusted dynamics of call duration shortening and peak frequency shifts accordingly. These task-specific differences existed from the onset of object approach, implying that bats plan their sensory-motor program for object approach exclusively based on information received from search call echoes. We provide insights into how echolocating animals deal with the constraints they face when sequentially sampling the world through sound by adjusting acoustic information flow from slow to extremely fast in a highly dynamic manner. Our results further highlight the paramount importance of high behavioural flexibility for acquiring information.Summary statement Having the right information for a specific job is crucial. Echolocating bats flexibly and independently adjust different call parameters to match the sensory-motor challenges of four different tasks.",716,103,218,28.0

Our study evaluated the ingestive behavior of young lambs in different tropical pastures to identify which variables interfere in their grazing activity. Two years of study were carried out with 54 weaned lambs distributed in three different swards: 1) monoculture of a upright grass, guinea grass (Panicum maximum; GG); 2) monoculture of a shrubby legume pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan; PP) and 3) contiguous areas with half the paddock with GG and half with PP (GP). The experiment was set out in a randomized complete block design. Lamb ingestive behavior was observed from sunrise to sunset with records every 5 minutes. To identify the main variables that affected with the lamb grazing activity, a multivariate analysis of the Decision Tree was performed. Our results showed that there was no difference in the ingestive behavior parameters of young lambs in different swards (P &gt; 0.05). There was interaction among the swards and the experimental periods for the variables idleness time and biting rate (P ≤ 0.05). Grazing time of the animals increased 40% with experimental period progression. The Decision Tree identified leaf:stem ratio as the variable that most influenced lamb grazing time in GG and GP swards while in the PP sward grazing time was directly related to the pasture height. The behavior of young lambs on tropical pasture is variable as there is a change in the behavioral response over time.

Over three years of study, we observed that territory holding males engaged in far more reciprocated (bidirectional) partnerships with other territory holders than expected by chance. Reciprocated partnerships were also stronger (i.e., the partners interacted more frequently) than non-reciprocated partnerships, controlling for spatial proximity. Furthermore, we show that a male’s social contribution to a given partner was predictive of the number of social interactions he received from that same partner. Finally, we show that reciprocation predicted the long-term stability of a partnership one year later.

For this purpose, we offered ten shelters of different colors to juveniles and adults and registered their preference. Our results showed that the criterion for shelter preference changed with ontogeny, since juveniles chose shelters based on chromaticity (preference for blue), while adults based their decisions on brightness (preference for dark gray).

The Fear Scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Scatter plots were used to observe the relationship between fear and other psychological outcomes: anxiety, depression and insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with COVID fear.Results COVID-19 fear score was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and weakly correlated with insomnia (p&lt;0.001).

Most theory about these intraspecific fights assumes that damage has an important role in determining the contest winner. Thus, defensive structures that reduce the amount of damage an individual accrues during intraspecific competition should provide a fighting advantage.Examples of such damage-reducing structures include the dermal shields of goats, the dorsal osteoderms of crocodiles, and the armored telsons of mantis shrimps. Although numerous studies have identified these defensive structures, no study has investigated whether they influence the outcomes of intraspecific fights.Here, we investigated whether inhibiting damage by enhancing an individual’s armor influenced fighting behavior and success in the giant mesquite bug, Thasus neocalifornicus (Insecta: Hemiptera: Coreidae).We found that experimentally manipulated individuals (i.e. those provided with additional armor) were 1.6 times more likely to win a fight when compared to the control. These results demonstrate that damage, and damage-reducing structures, can influence fighting success.The implications of these results are twofold. First, our results experimentally support a fundamental assumption of most theoretical fighting models: that damage is a fighting cost that can influence contest outcomes.

Acoustic signals, however, often experience amplitude losses during their transmission through the environment, reducing their detection range. Displaying from sites that increase the amplitude of the sound produced, such as cavities or some reflective surfaces, can improve the detectability of signals by distant receivers. Understanding how display sites influence sound production is, however, far from understood. We measured the effect of leaf calling sites on the calls of an arboreal (Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni) and a leaf-litter specialist (Silverstoneia flotator) frog species. We collected the leaves where males of both species were observed calling, and conducted playback experiments to measure their effect on the amplitude of frog calls. Overall, the leaves used by H. fleischmanni and S. flotator were of similar dimensions, and amplified the calls of each species by about 5.0 and 2.5 dB, respectively. The degree of call amplification was unrelated to leaf dimensions or the position of the frogs on the leaves, but explained by the different frequency content of the calls of each species. Depending on the spatial location of intended and unintended receivers, we suggest that amplification of frog calls by leaves could represent either a benefit or impose costs for arboreal and terrestrial species. We argue that the microhabitat of the substrate from which animals display needs to be considered when addressing signal evolution.Lay summary Animals produce signals from specific locations in the environment, yet we know surprisingly little about the effects of the small-scale habitat on animal communication. Here we show that the calls of a terrestrial and an arboreal frog species are amplified by the leaves they use as calling sites. We argue that the consequences of this enhancement need to be considered in relation to the spatial location of intended (males and females) and unintended receivers (predators and parasites).",602,68,131,28.0

An intact cricket walks with a tripod gait, similar to other insects. The motor control center of the leg movements is located in the thoracic ganglia. In this study, we investigated the walking gait patterns of crickets whose ventral nerve cords were surgically cut to gain an understanding of how the descending signals from the head ganglia and ascending signals from the abdominal nervous system into the thoracic ganglia mediate the initiation and coordination of the walking gait pattern. Crickets whose paired connectives between the brain and subesophageal ganglion (SEG) were cut exhibited a tripod gait pattern. However, when one side of the connectives between the brain and SEG was cut, the crickets continued to turn in the opposite direction to the connective cut. Crickets whose paired connectives between the SEG and prothoracic ganglion were cut did not walk, whereas the crickets exhibited an ordinal tripod gait pattern when one side of the connectives was intact. Crickets whose paired connectives between the metathoracic ganglion and abdominal ganglia were cut initiated walking, although the gait was not a coordinated tripod pattern, whereas the crickets exhibited a tripod gait when one side of the connectives was intact.

The recent integration of computer vision in tracking technologies will likely lead to fully automated behavioral pattern classification within the next few years. However, most current systems rely on offline data analysis and use computationally expensive techniques to track pre-recorded videos. To address this gap, we developed BACH (Behavior Analysis maCHine), a software that performs video tracking of insect groups in real time. BACH uses object recognition via convolutional neural networks and identifies individually tagged insects via an existing matrix code recognition algorithm. We compared the tracking performances of BACH and a human observer across a series of short videos of ants moving in a 2D arena. We found that, concerning computer vision-based ant detection only, BACH performed only slightly worse than the human observer. Contrarily, individual identification only attained human-comparable levels when ants moved relatively slow, and fell when ants walked relatively fast. This happened because BACH had a relatively low efficiency in detecting matrix codes in blurry images of ants walking at high speeds. BACH needs to undergo hardware and software adjustments to overcome its present limits. Nevertheless, our study emphasizes the possibility of, and the need for, integrating real time data analysis into the study of animal behavior.

A recent study on pheasants found that one-week-old chicks (Phasianus colchicus) preferentially aggregated with same-sex peers and this trend became more pronounced through development, suggesting that sexual segregation increases during ontogeny. However, it remains unclear whether this ability depends on experience or develops spontaneously. Using a similar experimental protocol, we investigated whether sex discrimination is present at birth in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) by testing the aggregation preferences of young chicks with clutch mates. We measured the amount of time spent close to male and female conspecifics in visually inexperienced chicks. Soon after hatching, both males and females preferentially aggregated with females. To clarify whether the experience with conspecifics modifies the initial preference for females we used an imprinting procedure. We exposed chicks to conspecifics of the same sex, different sex or both sexes for three days and then tested their preferences to aggregate with males or females. No sex preference was observed after three days of imprinting exposure. The disappearance of the initial sex preference shows that, although chicks can discriminate between conspecifics of different sex, sex segregation does not influence aggregation in the first week of life. We suggest that the absence of sexual assortment in the first week of age can enhance the social cohesion of the flock.",898,81,162,9.0

In the first and second experiments, 360 Hy-line W-36 layer hens and 525 day-old Ross-308 broiler chickens were used in a complete randomized design, respectively. Evaluated methods were setting the two regression equations for NPP-supplemented and phytase supplemented treatments with two sub-methods, include calibration curve (CC) or exclude the amount of phosphorus content of basal diet (CC-BD) in calculation, and exploring enzyme equivalency by comparing phosphorus deficient diet as an negative and supplemented diet by inorganic phosphorus sources as a positive control group (CNP). Experiment one included nine treatments (200, 300, 400 and 500 FTU/kg phytase was added to a phosphorus deficient basal diet contained 0.12% AvP, the rest four treatments were included basal diet supplemented with 0.20, 0.27, 0.35 and 0.43% AvP). Experiment two included seven treatments (a basal P deficient diet contained 0.27% AvP, and two increasing levels of AvP, 0.32 and 0.37%, and four doses of phytase 200, 300, 400 and 500 FTU/kg added to basal diet). Each treatment in the both experiments replicated five times. Results indicated that methods of estimation had a significant effect on phosphorus equivalence estimation (P&lt;0.0001). Fitted regression equations considering P content of basal diet (CC-BD) estimated rational values than those ignore it (CC) (0.161% vs 0.365% and 0.432% vs 0.564% for 500 FTU/kg phytase for broiler chicken and layer hens, respectively) (P&lt;0.0001).

The percentage of females that fed and the amount of blood they ingested were greater in mated females (90–100%) than in unmated females (48–60%). Mating state also modulated the female’s orientation towards human skin odor in an olfactometer; more mated (69%) than unmated (23%) females responded to human odors. The response rate of unmated females (60%) to human odor increased with longer starvation period, while the opposite pattern was observed in mated females (20%). Although fecundity after a single blood meal was unaffected by long or short residence with males, females subjected to frequent copulations had lower survivorship and lifespan than females subjected to males for only 24 h.

We had previously postulated that paracetamol exposure early in life, if combined with antioxidants that prevent accumulation of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of paracetamol, might be innocuous. In this study, we administered paracetamol at or below the currently recommended therapeutic dose to male laboratory rat pups aged 4-10 days. The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37-49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial behavior, in animals treated with paracetamol plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P &lt; 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of paracetamol in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress.",714,74,122,16.0

As larvae are directly responsible for these damages, many research efforts are devoted to find plant cultivars which are resistant or tolerant to pest attacks. However, such studies take time, efforts and are costly, especially when one wants to not only find resistance traits but also to evaluate their heritability. We present here a high throughput approach to screen plants for resistance or chemicals for their deterrence, using a leaf-disk consumption assay, which is both suitable for large scale tests and economically affordable. To monitor larvae feeding on leaf disks placed over a layer of agar, we designed 3D models of 50 cages plates. One webcam can sample simultaneously 3 of such plates at a rate of 1 image/min, and follow individual feeding activities on each leaf disk and the movements of 150 larvae. The resulting image stacks are first processed with a custom program running under an open-source image analysis package (Icy) to measure the surface of each leaf disk over time. We further developed statistical procedures running under the R software, to analyze the time course of the feeding activities of the larvae and to compare them between treatments. As a test case, we compared how European corn borer larvae respond to quinine, considered as a bitter alkaloid for many organisms, and to NeemAzal containing azadirachtin, which is a common antifeedant against pest insects. We found that increasing doses of azadirachtin reduce and delay feeding. However, contrary to our expectation, quinine was found poorly effective at the range of concentrations tested. The 3D printed model of the cage and the camera holder, the plugins running under Icy, and the R scripts are freely available, and can be modified according to the particular needs of the users.",1333,240,538,35.0

Yet individually sensitive measurements offer extraordinary opportunities, from informing theoretical models to enabling truly individualised clinical assessment. Here, we test the robustness of fast, periodic, visual stimulation (FPVS), an emerging method proposed to elicit detectable responses to written words in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of individual subjects. The method is non-invasive, passive, and requires only a few minutes of testing, making it a potentially powerful tool to test comprehension in those who do not speak or who struggle with long testing procedures. In an initial study, Lochy et al. (2015) used FPVS to detect word processing in 8 out of 10 fluent French readers. Here, we attempted to replicate their study in a new sample of ten fluent English readers. Participants viewed rapid streams of pseudo-words with words embedded at regular intervals, while we recorded their EEG. Based on Lochy et al., we expected that words would elicit a steady-state response at the word-presentation frequency (2 Hz) over parieto-occipital electrode sites. However, across 40 datasets (10 participants, two conditions, and two regions of interest - ROIs), only four datasets met the criteria for a unique response to words. This corresponds to a 10% detection rate. We conclude that FPVS should be developed further before it can serve as an individually-sensitive measure of written word processing.",553,47,144,33.0

Mechanistic understanding is limited, and target-based approaches are challenging. High-throughput methods may be an important parallel approach to drug-discovery and mechanistic research. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal candidate as a model for this. A rich subset of its behaviour can be studied, and hundreds of morphological and behavioural features can be quantified, then aggregated to yield a ‘signature’. Perturbation of this behavioural signature may provide a tool that can be used to quantify the effects of anaesthetic regimes, and act as an outcome marker for drug screening and molecular target research.Methods Larval C. elegans were exposed to: isoflurane, ketamine, morphine, dexmedetomidine, and lithium (and combinations). Behaviour was recorded, and videos analysed with automated algorithms to extract behavioural and morphological features.Results Anaesthetic exposure during early development leads to persisting morphological and behavioural variation (in total, 125 features/exposure combinations). Higher concentrations, and combinations of isoflurane with ketamine, lead to more feature ‘hits’. Morphine and dexmedetomidine do not appear to lead to behavioural impairment. Lithium rescues the neurotoxic phenotype produced by isoflurane.Conclusions Findings correlate well with vertebrate research: impairment is dependent on agent, is concentration-specific, is more likely with combination therapies, and can potentially be rescued by lithium. These results suggest that C. elegans may be an appropriate model with which to pursue phenotypic screens for drugs that mitigate the neurobehavioural impairment. Some possibilities are suggested for how high-throughput platforms might be organised in service of this field.",553,63,114,22.0

Prolactin, the main hormone mediating avian parental behaviour, has been hypothesized to play a key role in the orchestration of host responses to brood parasitic eggs. Based on the positive association between plasma prolactin and parental attachment to eggs, decreasing levels of this hormone are expected to facilitate egg-rejection decisions in parasitized clutches. We tested this prediction by implanting Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula) females with an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, bromocriptine mesylate, to experimentally low their prolactin levels. We found that bromocriptine-treated females rejected mimetic model eggs at higher rates than placebo-treated individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that host responses to brood parasitism are mediated by the primary endocrine pathway that orchestrates the expression of avian parental care.",577,141,218,21.0

We exposed full size colonies to pollen contaminated with field-relevant doses of the fungicides (chlorothalonil and propicanizole), insecticides (chlorypyrifos and fenpropathrin) or both, noting a significant reduction in pollen consumption in colonies exposed to fungicides compared to control. While we found no difference in the total amount of pollen collected per colony, a higher proportion of pollen to non-pollen foragers was detected in all pesticide exposed colonies. After ceasing treatments we measured brood development, discovering a significant increase in brood loss and/or cannibalism across all pesticide exposed groups.

The exact format of visual memory encoded by neural systems during route learning and following is still unclear. Here we propose that interconnections between Kenyon cells in the Mushroom Body (MB) could encode spatio-temporal memory of visual motion experienced when moving along a route. In our implementation, visual motion is sensed using an event-based camera mounted on a robot, and learned by a biologically constrained spiking neural network model, based on simplified MB architecture and using modified leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. In contrast to previous image-matching models where all memories are stored in parallel, the continuous visual flow is inherently sequential. Our results show that the model can distinguish learned from unlearned route segments, with some tolerance to internal and external noise, including small displacements. The neural response can also explain observed behaviour taken to support sequential memory in ant experiments. However, obtaining comparable robustness to insect navigation might require the addition of biomimetic pre-processing of the input stream, and determination of the appropriate motor strategy to exploit the memory output.",563,47,209,12.0

The expectation for learning was manipulated through oral instructions prior to memory reactivation. On day one, participants underwent differential fear conditioning to two spider images (CS+ and CS-). On day two, participants were assigned to either a reactivation with expectation for learning group, a reactivation with no expectation for learning group, or a no reactivation group. On day three, return of fear in response to the CS+ spider image was measured following reinstatement (i.e., four shocks). Fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance response (SCR) were taken as measures of fear.Results The study found evidence that the expectation for learning may enhanced reconsolidation with FPS as a measure of fear as it was only the expectation for learning group in which FPS to the CS+ remained stable following reinstatement, however this effect was small and non-robust. In contrast, no evidence of reconsolidation was observed for SCR, as all participants exhibited a return of fear following reinstatement.Implications These findings suggest that a verbal manipulation of the expectation for learning may not be salient enough to induce reconsolidation as measured by SCR but may be sufficient as measured by FPS. Additionally, given in the inconsistent findings between SCR and FPS, the study’s results bring into question whether the post-retrieval extinction paradigm is appropriate to investigate reconsolidation using both physiological measures concurrently.",419,66,135,31.0

These networks have been used to model life’s origins. More recently, they have been applied to the emergence of cognitive structure capable of undergoing cultural evolution. Mental representations of knowledge and experiences play the role of catalytic molecules, the interactions among them (e.g., the forging of new associations or affordances) play the role of reactions, and thought processes are modeled as chains of these interactions. We posit that one or more genetic mutations may have allowed thought to be spontaneously tailored to the situation by modulating the degree of (1) divergence (versus convergence), (2) ness (versus concreteness), and (3) context-specificity. This culminated in persistent, unified autocatalytic semantic networks that bridged previously compartmentalized knowledge and experience. We explain the model using one of the oldest-known uncontested examples of figurative art: the carving of the Hohlenstein-Stadel Löwenmensch, or lion-man. The approach keeps track of where in a cultural lineage each innovation appears, and models cumulative change step by step.

Recent transfer learning approaches for behavioral tracking have considerably advanced the state of the art. Typically these methods treat each video frame and each object to be tracked independently. In this work, we improve on these methods (particularly in the regime of few training labels) by leveraging the rich spatiotemporal structures pervasive in behavioral video — specifically, the spatial statistics imposed by physical constraints (e.g., paw to elbow distance), and the temporal statistics imposed by smoothness from frame to frame. We propose a probabilistic graphical model built on top of deep neural networks, Deep Graph Pose (DGP), to leverage these useful spatial and temporal constraints, and develop an efficient structured variational approach to perform inference in this model. The resulting semi-supervised model exploits both labeled and unlabeled frames to achieve significantly more accurate and robust tracking while requiring users to label fewer training frames. In turn, these tracking improvements enhance performance on downstream applications, including robust unsupervised segmentation of behavioral “syllables,” and estimation of interpretable “disentangled” low-dimensional representations of the full behavioral video.

However, instances of aggression, which may escalate to cannibalism, can be vital for survival, although the factors (e.g. genetic or environmental) leading to cannibalism vary across taxa. While cannibalism can greatly accelerate individual growth, it may also reduce inclusive fitness when kin are consumed. As a solution to this problem, some cannibals demonstrate kin discrimination and preferentially attack unrelated individuals. Here, we used both experimental and modeling approaches to consider how physical traits (e.g. size in relation to opponent) and genetic relatedness mediate aggressive behavior in dyads of cannibalistic Dendrobates tinctorius tadpoles. We paired sibling, half-sibling, and non-sibling tadpoles of different sizes together in an arena and recorded their aggression and activity. We found that the interaction between size and relatedness predicts aggressive behavior: large non-siblings are significantly more aggressive than large siblings. Unexpectedly, although siblings tended to attack less overall, in size mismatched pairs they attacked faster than in non-sibling treatments. Ultimately, it appears that larval aggression reflects a balance between relatedness and size where individuals trade-off their own fitness with that of their relatives.",887,73,224,28.0

We found that participants were more likely to cooperate with the initially tough partner than with the initially nice partner. Computational modeling revealed that behavioral changes were driven by changes in perceived social rewards from reciprocity.

A fast learning strategy involves using working memory of recently rewarded objects to guide choices. A slower learning strategy uses prediction errors to gradually update value expectations to improve choices. How the fast and slow strategies work together in scenarios with real-world stimulus complexity is not well known. Here, we disentangle their relative contributions in rhesus monkeys while they learned the relevance of object features at variable attentional load. We found that learning behavior across six subjects is consistently best predicted with a model combining (i) fast working memory (ii) slower reinforcement learning from differently weighted positive and negative prediction errors, as well as (iii) selective suppression of non-chosen feature values and (iv) a meta-learning mechanism adjusting exploration rates based on a memory trace of recent errors. These mechanisms cooperate differently at low and high attentional loads. While working memory was essential for efficient learning at lower attentional loads, enhanced weighting of negative prediction errors and meta-learning were essential for efficient learning at higher attentional loads. Together, these findings pinpoint a canonical set of learning mechanisms and demonstrate how they cooperate when subjects flexibly adjust to environments with variable real-world attentional demands.Significance statement Learning which visual features are relevant for achieving our goals is challenging in real-world scenarios with multiple distracting features and feature dimensions. It is known that in such scenarios learning benefits significantly from attentional prioritization. Here we show that beyond attention, flexible learning uses a working memory system, a separate learning gain for avoiding negative outcomes, and a meta-learning process that adaptively increases exploration rates whenever errors accumulate. These subcomponent processes of cognitive flexibility depend on distinct learning signals that operate at varying timescales, including the most recent reward outcome (for working memory), memories of recent outcomes (for adjusting exploration), and reward prediction errors (for attention augmented reinforcement learning).

To recognise predators, chemosensory cues play a pivotal role, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. However, it is less known whether the ability to use these cues to respond with adequate antipredator behaviour varies between individuals occupying different habitats that are dissimilar in predation risk. Using field experiments, we examined antipredator behaviour of larval fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) from two different habitats, ponds and streams. Among other differences, ponds and streams are inhabited by habitat-specific predators, such as alpine newts (Ichthyosaura alpestris) occurring in ponds. We exposed larvae from both habitats to either chemical cues from alpine newts or a blank control (tap water) and investigated potential differences in their behavioural responses in two experiments. Pond larvae, but not stream larvae, became significantly less active when faced with chemical cues from newts compared to those faced with a control stimulus. Moreover, larvae from both habitats tested in water containing chemical cues spent significantly less time outside a shelter than those in control water. Our results demonstrate that larval fire salamanders recognise predatory newts through kairomones and alter their behaviour accordingly.

Gilbert",397802;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/397802,"Most organisms must regulate their nutritional intake in an environment full of complex food choices. While this process is well understood for self-sufficient organisms, dependent offspring, such as bee larvae, in practice have limited food choices because food is provided by parents. Nutrient balancing may therefore be achieved by offspring, by parents on offspring’s behalf, or by both, whether cooperatively or in conflict.We used the Geometric Framework to investigate the capacity of dependent larval mason bees (Osmia bicornis) to regulate their intake of protein and carbohydrate. Female Osmia seal eggs individually inside cells they have provisioned with pollen, and have no contact with developing offspring, allowing offspring choices to be studied in isolation. Herbivorous insect larvae are typically expected to balance protein and carbohydrate to maximise growth and reproduction.Contrary to prediction, carbohydrate and not protein mediated both growth and survival to pupation. Accordingly, larvae prioritised maintaining a constant intake of carbohydrate and self-selected a relatively carbohydrate biased diet compared to other hymenopterans, while tolerating wide excesses and deficiencies of protein, rendering them potentially vulnerable to dietary change or manipulation. Reasons for prioritising carbohydrate may include (1) the relative abundance of protein in their normal pollen diet, (2) the relative paucity of nectar in parental provisions making carbohydrate a scarce resource, or (3) the requirement for diapause for all O. bicornis larvae. Larvae were intolerant of moderate dietary dilution, likely reflecting an evolutionary history of nutrient-dense food.Our results demonstrate that dependent offspring can remain active participants in balancing their own nutrients even when sedentary, and, moreover, even in mass provisioning systems where parents and offspring have no physical contact. Research should now focus on whether and how evolutionary interests of parent and dependent offspring coincide or conflict with respect to food composition, and the implications for species’ resilience to changing environments.",2227,421,751,33.0

While some animals find themselves adrift, homeless with the uncertainty of resources resulting from the urban encroachment, few of them manage to survive by altering their natural behavioural patterns, and co-exist with humans. Folivorous colobines, such as grey langur, whose feeding repertoire largely consists of plant parts, tend to be more attuned to the urban high-calorie food sources to attain maximum fitness benefits within the concrete jungle having an insignificant green cover. However, such a mismatch between their generalized feeding behaviour and specialized gut physiology reminds us of the Liem’s paradox and demands considerable scientific attention which could tell us the story behind colobines’ successful co-existence within human settlements. Besides understanding their population dynamics, the effective management of these urbanized, free-ranging, non-human primate populations also depends on their altered feeding preferences, altogether which could lead us to the development of an ecologically sound urban ecosystem. Here, we have used a field-based experimental set up which allows langurs to choose between natural and urban food options, being independent of any inter-specific conflicts over resources due to food scarcity. The multinomial logit model reveals the choice-based decision making of these free-ranging grey langurs in an urban settlement of West Bengal, India, where they have not only learned to approach the human-provisioned urban food items but also shown a keen interest in it. While urbanization imposes tremendous survival challenges to these animals, it also opens up for various alternative options for human-animal co-existence which is reflected in this study, and could guide us for the establishment of a sustainable urban ecosystem in the future.HIGHLIGHTSThe feeding repertoire of free-ranging grey langurs at Dakshineswar largely consists of urban food items in contrast to the langurs of Nangi, and Nalpur who mostly depend on natural food sources.High human-langur interactions together with the scarcity of natural plant-based food sources could be considered as an intriguing driving force behind langurs’ altered feeding habits in Dakhineswar.The field-based experimental set up allows free-ranging langurs to choose between natural and urban food options in an urban settlement like Dakhineswar.Urban food items outperformed natural food items as the most chosen one, indicating langurs’ altered feeding preferences which facilitate their successful co-existence within an urban ecosystem.",719,180,257,50.0

We examined whether prairie voles, one of the more highly social animals, help conspecifics who are soaked in water by opening a door to a safe area. Door-opening latency decreased as task sessions progressed, suggesting that prairie voles learn helping behavior. In addition, when the conspecific was not soaked in water, the latency of the door-opening did not decrease, suggesting that the distress of the conspecific is necessary for the learning of the door-opening. Thus, the door-opening behavior in prairie voles can be considered a helping behavior that is motivated by empathy for the distress of conspecifics. We also examined the helping behavior in prairie voles in which oxytocin receptors were genetically knocked out. Oxytocin receptor knockout voles demonstrated impaired learning of the door-opening. This suggests that oxytocin is important for the emergence of helping behavior.",1566,142,439,32.0

Studies suggest that facial expressions may be a more ‘honest’ expression of emotional state in horses than behavioral or physiological parameters. This study sought to describe the facial expressions during stress of healthy horses free of pain, using a standardized method of recording facial expressions in video. Stress was induced in 28 horses by subjecting them to road transport and 10 of these horses were also subjected to social isolation. The horses served as their own control. A body-mounted, remote controlled heart rate monitor provided continuous heart rate measurements during the interventions. The horses’ facial expressions were video-recorded during the interventions. Frequency and duration of each facial expression were then determined, according to the Equine Facial Action Coding System. Heart rate increased during the stressful interventions (p=0.01), confirming that the interventions were stressful. Using both the human investigation- and the co-occurrence methods, the following facial traits could be observed during stress: eye white increase (p&lt;0.001), nostril dilator (p&lt;0.001), upper eyelid raiser (p&lt;0.001), inner brow raiser (p=0.042), tongue show (p&lt;0.001) along with an increase in ‘ear flicker’ (p&lt;0.001) and blink frequency (p&lt;0.001). The facial actions were successfully used to train a machine-learning classifier to discriminate between stressed and calm horses, with an accuracy of 74.2 %. Most of the facial features identified correspond well with previous research on the subject, for example flared nostrils, repetitive mouth behaviors, increased eye white, tongue show and ear movements. Some features selected as indicative of emotional pain-free stress are used in face-based pain assessment tools, such as dilated nostrils, eye white increase or inner brow raiser. The relation between facial expressions of stress and pain should therefore further be studied.",925,176,426,36.0

Studies across many taxa show that adult sex ratio, a major determinant of host mating dynamics, is often skewed - sometimes strongly - toward males or females. However, few predictions exist for the effects of skewed sex ratio on STI epidemiology, and none when coupled with sex biased disease characteristics. Here we use mathematical modelling to examine how interactions between sex ratio and disease characteristics affect STI prevalence in males and females. Notably, we find that while overall disease prevalence peaks at equal sex ratios, prevalence per sex peaks at skewed sex ratios. Furthermore, disease characteristics, sex-biased or not, drive predictable differences in male and female STI prevalence as sex ratio varies, with higher transmission and lower virulence generally increasing differences between the sexes for a given sex ratio. These findings may be due to a balance between increased per-capita mating in the less common sex, and a reduction in mating rate - hence disease prevalence - at the population level. Our work reveals new insights into how STI prevalence in males and females depends on a complex interaction between host population sex ratio and disease characteristics.",887,195,221,30.0

The outcome of these sensorimotor processes can be challenged by head movements that perturb the sensory coordinate frames directing behaviors. In the case of visually-guided behaviors, visual gaze stabilization results from the integrated activity of the vestibuloocular reflex and motor efference copy originating within circuits driving locomotor behavior. A recent videographic study showed that echolocating bats exhibit inflight head stabilization during a target identification and landing task, though compensatory timing of the bats’ sonar signals was not reported. In the present investigation we tested hypotheses that head stabilization is more broadly implemented during epochs of exploratory flight, and is temporally associated with emitted sonar signals, which would optimize acoustic gaze. This was achieved by measuring head and body kinematics with motion sensors secured to the head and body of free-flying Egyptian fruit bats. These devices were integrated with ultrasonic microphones to record the bat’s sonar emissions and elucidate their temporal association with periods of head stabilization. Head accelerations in the Earth-vertical axis were asymmetric with respect to wing downbeat and upbeat relative to body accelerations. This indicated that inflight head and body accelerations were uncoupled, outcomes consistent with the implementation of head movements that limit vertical acceleration during wing downbeat. Furthermore, sonar emissions during stable flight occurred most often during wing downbeat and head stabilization, supporting the conclusion that head stabilization behavior optimized sonar gaze and environmental interrogation via echolocation.Summary statement Direct measurements of head and body kinematics from affixed motion sensors revealed head stabilization behaviors during exploratory flights in bats. Most sonar emissions were temporally correlated with this behavior, thereby contributing to the optimization of acoustic gaze.",601,92,200,35.0

We used this facility to train monkeys on a challenging same-different task. Remarkably, this facility enabled a naïve monkey to learn the task merely by observing trained monkeys.

Compared to cognitive phenotypes, gait phenotypes are readily and comparably assessed in both humans and model organisms, and are controlled by well-defined CNS circuits. Discovery of a common gait phenotype between NDDs might suggest shared cellular and molecular deficits and highlight simple outcome variables to potentially quantify longitudinal treatment efficacy in NDDs. We therefore characterized gait using the DigiGait assay in two different NDD models: the complete deletion (CD) mouse, which models hemizygous loss of the complete WS locus, and the Nf1+/R681X mouse, which models a patient-derived heterozygous germline NF1 mutation. We collected longitudinal data across five developmental time points (postnatal days 21-30) and one early adulthood time point. Compared to wild type littermate controls, both models displayed markedly similar spatial, temporal, and postural gait abnormalities during development. Developing CD mice also displayed significant decreases in variability metrics. Multiple gait abnormalities observed across Nf1+/R681X mouse development persisted into early adulthood, including increased stride length and decreased stride frequency, while developmental abnormalities in CD mice largely resolved by adulthood. These findings suggest that gait subcomponents affected in NDDs show overlap between disorders as well as some disorder-specific features, which may change over the course of development. Our incorporation of spatial, temporal, and postural gait measures also provides a template for gait characterization in other NDD models, and a platform to examining circuits or longitudinal therapeutics.Lay Summary Gait changes have been reported in Williams Syndrome and Neurofibromatosis Type 1, but how these changes develop over time has not been explored. We therefore studied gait in mouse models of these two disorders across time. We found multiple shared differences in gait as compared to healthy controls at the younger ages in both models.

Studies in non-DREADD-expressing rodents suggest CNO or a DREADD agonist that lacks active metabolites, such as Compound 21 (C21), change rodent behavior (e.g. decrease locomotion), but chronic injection of CNO does not change locomotion. However, it is unknown if chronic CNO changes behaviors relevant to locomotion, exploration, anxiety, and depression, or if chronic C21 changes any aspect of mouse behavior. Here non-DREADD-expressing mice received i.p. Vehicle (Veh), CNO, or C21 (1mg/kg) 5 days/week for 16 weeks and behaviors were assessed over time. Veh, CNO, and C21 mice had similar weight gain over the 16-week-experiment.

Here we assessed male and female A. burtoni in two cognitive tasks: a novel object recognition task and a spatial task. We hypothesized that males outperform females in a spatial learning task and exhibit more neophilic/exploratory behavior in across both tasks. In the present study we find that both sexes prefer the familiar object in a novel object recognition task, but the time at which they exhibit this preference differs between the sexes. Females more frequently learned the spatial task, exhibiting longer decision latencies and quicker error correction, suggesting a potential speed-accuracy tradeoff.Furthermore, the sexes differ in space use in both tasks and in a principal component analysis of the spatial task. A model selection analysis finds that preference, approach, and interaction duration in the novel object recognition task that reach a threshold of importance averaged across all models.

In the marine world, most studies which have investigated this question have focused on marine mammals such as whales and dolphins. For sharks, recent studies have demonstrated preferential associations among individuals from which social communities emerge. Assortment patterns have been found according to phenotypic or behavioural traits but the role of genetic relatedness in shaping the social structure of adult shark populations has, to the best our knowledge, never been investigated. Here, we used a social network analysis crossed with DNA microsatellite genotyping to investigate the role of the genetic relatedness in the social structure of a blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) population. Based on data from 156 groups of sharks, we used generalized affiliation indices to isolate social preferences from non-social associations, controlling for the contribution of sex, size, gregariousness, spatial and temporal overlap on social associations, to test for the influence of genetic relatedness on social structure. A double permutation procedure was employed to confirm our results and account for issues arising from potentially elevated type I and type II error rates. Kinship was not a predictor of associations and affiliations among sharks at the dyad or community levels as individuals tended to associate independently of the genetic relatedness among them. The lack of parental care in this species may contribute to the breakdown of family links in the population early in life, thereby preventing the formation of kin-based social networks.",2363,316,736,39.0

Even though larvae can only rely on temporal cues in this closed-loop setup, we find that they are capable of finding preferred areas of low light intensity. Further detailed analysis of their behavior reveals that larvae turn more frequently and that heading angle changes increase when they experience brightness increments over extended periods of time. We suggest that temporal integration of brightness change during runs is an important – and so far largely unexplored – element of phototaxis.Summary statement Using a novel closed-loop behavioral assay, we show that Drosophila larvae can navigate light gradients exclusively using temporal cues.

We investigated whether the acoustic structure of grunts of 27 male baboons of two gangs varied with party/gang membership and genetic relatedness. Males in this species are philopatric, resulting in increased male relatedness within gangs and parties. Grunts from members were more similar within than across social levels (N = 351 dyads for comparison within and between gangs, and N = 169 dyads within and between parties), but the effect sizes were small. Yet, acoustic similarity did not correlate with genetic relatedness, suggesting that higher amounts of social interactions rather than genetic relatedness promote the observed vocal convergence.

To gain insight into the computational underpinnings of globally focused cognition, we recorded from neurons in a core decision-making region, area 14 of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as macaques performed a foraging search task with long inter-trial intervals (ITIs). We find that during the ITI, ensemble firing is associated with increased discriminability of a key mnemonic variable, recent reward rate, which in turn predicts upcoming search strategy. ITI activity is also associated with increased ensemble dimensionality and faster subspace reorganization, presumed markers of processing complexity.

The predictive brain hypothesis explains this malleability as a consequence of the interplay between incoming sensory information and our body expectations. However, given the interaction between perception and action, we might also expect that actions would arise due to prediction errors, especially in conflicting situations. Here we describe a computational model, based on the free-energy principle, that forecasts involuntary movements in sensorimotor conflicts. We experimentally confirm those predictions in humans by means of a virtual reality rubber-hand illusion. Participants generated movements (forces) towards the virtual hand, regardless of its location with respect to the real arm, with little to no forces produced when the virtual hand overlaid their physical hand. The congruency of our model predictions and human observations shows that the brain-body is generating actions to reduce the prediction error between the expected arm location and the new visual arm. This observed unconscious mechanism is an empirical validation of the perception-action duality in body adaptation to uncertain situations and evidence of the active component of predictive processing.Author Summary Humans’ capacity to perceive and control their body in space is central in awareness, adaptation and safe interaction. From low-level body perception to body-ownership, discovering how the brain represents the body and generates actions is of major importance for cognitive science and also for robotics and artificial intelligence. The present study shows that humans move their body to match the expected location according to other (visual) sensory input, which corresponds to reducing the prediction error. This means that the brain adapts to conflicting or uncertain information from the senses by unconsciously acting in the world.",2015,463,530,20.0

We investigated the molecular and functional profile of the Halyomorpha halys type 1 tyramine receptor gene (HhTAR1) and its role in olfactory functions of this pest. Molecular and pharmacological analyses confirmed that the HhTAR1 gene codes for a true TAR1. The RT-qPCR analysis revealed that HhTAR1 is expressed mostly in adult brain and antennae as well as in early development stages (eggs, 1st and 2nd instar nymphs). In particular, among the antennomeres that compose a typical H. halys antenna, HhTAR1 was more expressed in flagellomeres. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation revealed the type and distribution of sensilla on adult H. halys antennae: both flagellomeres appear rich in trichoid and grooved sensilla, known to be associated with olfactory functions. Through a RNAi approach, topically delivered HhTAR1 dsRNA induced a 50 % gene downregulation after 24 h in H. halys 2nd instar nymphs. An innovative behavioral assay revealed that HhTAR1 RNAi-silenced 2nd instar nymphs were less susceptible to the alarm pheromone component (E)-2 decenal as compared to control. These results provide critical information concerning the TAR1 role in olfaction regulation, especially alarm pheromone reception, in H. halys.

However, making causal inferences about these adaptive benefits requires experimental manipulation of the social environment, which is rarely feasible in the field. Here we manipulated the number of conspecifics in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in the wild, and quantified how this affected a key benefit of sociality, social foraging, by investigating several components of foraging success. As adaptive benefits of social foraging may differ between sexes, we studied males and females separately, expecting females, the more social and risk-averse sex, to benefit more from conspecifics than males. Conducting over 1,600 foraging trials, we found that in both sexes, increasing the number of conspecifics led to faster detection of novel food patches and a higher probability of feeding following detection of the patch, resulting in greater individual resource consumption. The slope of the latter relationship differed between the sexes, with males unexpectedly exhibiting a stronger social benefit. Our study provides rare causal evidence for the adaptive benefits of social foraging in the wild, and highlights that sex differences in sociality do not necessarily imply an unequal ability to profit from the presence of others.",1226,116,249,22.0

However, the role of these structures in the regulation of behavior remains unknown. To study the role of cilia in behavior, we employ mouse models of the human ciliopathy, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS). Here, we demonstrate that BBS mice have significant impairments in context fear conditioning, a form of associative learning. Moreover, we show that postnatal deletion of BBS gene function, as well as congenital deletion, specifically in the forebrain, impairs context fear conditioning. Analyses indicated that these behavioral impairments are not the result of impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. However, our results indicate that these behavioral impairments are linked to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Two-week treatment with lithium chloride partially restores the proliferation of hippocampal neurons which leads to a rescue of context fear conditioning. Overall, our results identify a novel role of cilia genes in hippocampal neurogenesis and long-term context fear conditioning.Author summary The primary cilium is a microtubule-based membranous projection on the cell that is involved in multiple physiological functions. Patients who have cilia dysfunction commonly have intellectual disability. However, it is not known how cilia affect learning and memory. Studying mouse models of a cilia-based intellectual disability can provide insight into learning and memory. One such cilia-based intellectual disability is Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), which is caused by homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of BBS genes. We found that a mouse model of BBS (Bbs1M390R/M390R mice) has learning and memory defects. In addition, we found that other mouse models of BBS have similar learning and memory defects. These BBS mouse models have difficulty associating an environment with an aversive stimulus, a task designed to test context fear memory. This type of memory involves the hippocampus. We found that Bbs1M390R/M390R mice have decreased cell production in the hippocampus. Treating Bbs1M390R/M390R mice with a compound (lithium) that increases cell production in the hippocampus improved the learning and memory deficits. Our results demonstrate a potential role for cilia in learning and memory, and indicate that lithium is a potential treatment, requiring further study, for the intellectual disability phenotype of BBS.",645,184,182,48.0

Recently, we have shown that the small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, distinguishes between host and non-host plants based on the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of light reflected from their leaves. To determine how polarized light cues affect host plant foraging by female P. rapae across their entire visual range including the ultraviolet (300-650 nm), we applied photo polarimetry demonstrating large differences in the DoLP of leaf-reflected light among plant species generally and between host and non-host plants specifically. As polarized light cues are directionally dependent, we also tested, and modelled, the effect of approach trajectory on the polarization of plant-reflected light and the resulting attractiveness to P. rapae. Using photo polarimetry measurements of plants under a range of light source and observer positions, we reveal several distinct effects when polarized reflections are examined on a whole-plant basis rather than at the scale of pixels or of entire plant canopies. Most notably from our modeling, certain approach trajectories are optimal for foraging butterflies, or insects generally, to discriminate between plant species on the basis of the DoLP of leaf-reflected light.",546,37,111,42.0

The probability of receiving a reward in two of the cage corners changed between 0.9 and 0.3 every 48 h over a period of ~33 days. As expected, in most animals, the odds of repeating a corner choice were increased if that choice was previously rewarded. Interestingly, the time elapsed from the previous choice also influenced the probability of repeating the choice, and this effect was independent of previous outcome. Behavioral data were fitted to a series of reinforcement learning models. Best fits were achieved when the reward prediction update was coupled with separate learning rates from positive and negative outcomes and additionally a “fictitious” update of the expected value of the nonselected choice. Additional inclusion of a time-dependent decay of the expected values improved the fit marginally in some cases.",1312,200,412,32.0

Previous work has shown that reliable signaling can be maintained if signalers pay fitness costs for signaling at different intensities and these costs are greater for lower quality individuals than higher quality ones. Models supporting this idea typically assume that continuous variation in signal intensity is perceived as such by receivers. In many organisms, however, receivers have threshold responses to signals, in which they respond to a signal if it is above a threshold value and do not respond if the signal is below the threshold value. Here, we use both analytical and individual-based models to investigate how such threshold responses affect the reliability of assessment signals. We show that reliable signaling systems can break down when receivers have an invariant threshold response, but reliable signaling can be rescued if there is variation among receivers in the location of their threshold boundary. Our models provide an important step towards understanding signal evolution when receivers have threshold responses to continuous signal variation.",1072,95,238,39.0

Females arrived a mean of 5.5 days prior to birth (range 1-11, sd=1.6), and females arriving later in the breeding season cut that pre-birth interval by 1.8 days relative to early arrivers.

While bee flower choice is well studied, we know relatively little about how they choose between multiple rewarding flowers in complex floral environments. Two important factors that could influence bee visual search for multiple flowers are the physical saliency (colour contrast against the background) of flowers and the reward value associated with them. We here investigated how these two different factors contribute to bee visual search. We trained bees to independently recognize two rewarding colours that in different experiments differed in either physical saliency, reward value or both. We then measured their choices and attention to these colours in the presence of distractors in a test without reinforcement. We found that bees preferred more salient or higher rewarding flowers and ignored distractors. When the high-reward flowers were less salient than the low-reward flowers, bees were nonetheless equally likely to choose high-reward flowers. Bees were more also more likely to attend to these high-reward flowers, with higher inspection times around them and faster search times when choosing them. When flowers differed in reward, we also found an effect of the training order with low-reward targets being more likely to be chosen if they had been encountered during the more immediate training session prior to the test.

This process defines growth stages and is controlled by a conserved neuroendocrine system. Each molting event is divided in several critical time points, such as pre-molt, molt and post-molt, and leaves the animals in a temporarily highly vulnerable state while their cuticle is re-hardening. The molting events occur in an immediate ecdysis sequence within a specific time window during the development. Each sub-stage takes only a short amount of time, which is generally in the order of minutes. To find these relatively short behavioral events, one needs to follow the entire post-embryonal development over several days. As the manual detection of the ecdysis sequence is time consuming and error prone, we designed a monitoring system to facilitate the continuous observation of the post-embryonal development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Under constant environmental conditions we are able to observe the life cycle from the embryonic state to the adult, which takes about ten days in this species. Specific processing algorithms developed and implemented in Fiji and R allow us to determine unique behavioral events on an individual level – including egg hatching, ecdysis and pupation. In addition, we measured growth rates and activity patterns for individual larvae. Our newly created RPackage PEDtracker can predict critical developmental events and thus offers the possibility to perform automated screens that identify changes in various aspects of larval development.

Investigations are well served by experimental approaches that allow tractable investigation of the underpinning genetic basis of circuits that control behaviours that operate in the biological domains that are neuro-atypical in autism. The model organism C. elegans provides an experimental platform to investigate the effect of genetic mutations on behavioural outputs including those that impact social biology.

We trained Phrynus marginemaculatus to recognize a home shelter characterized by both discriminative olfactory and tactile stimuli. In tests, subjects readily discriminated between shelters based on the paired stimuli. However, subjects failed to recognize the shelter in tests with either of the component stimuli alone. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the terminal phase of their navigational behavior, shelter recognition, can be supported by the integration of multisensory stimuli as a configural representation.

But It is not clear in the conditions where the context consists only of the juxtaposition of a series of options, and there is no such explicit counterfactual component (Partial feedback), whether and how the relativity will be emerged. Here for investigating whether and how implicit and explicit counterfactual components can affect reinforcement learning, we used two Partial and Complete feedback paradigms, in which options were associated with some reward distributions. Our modeling analysis illustrates that the model which uses the outcome of chosen option for updating values of both chosen and unchosen options, which is in line with diffusive function of dopamine on the striatum, can better account for the behavioral data. We also observed that size of this bias depends on the involved systems in the brain, such that this effect is larger in the transfer phase where subcortical systems are more involved, and is smaller in the deliberative value estimation phase where cortical system is more needed. Furthermore, our data shows that contextual effect is not only limited to probabilistic reward but also it extends to reward with amplitude. These results show that by extending counterfactual concept, we can better account for why there is contextual effect in a condition where there is no extra information of unchosen outcome.",310,62,149,27.0

We therefore 1) assessed whether cognitive and physical performance (i.e., gait speed) are lower in older aged animals; 2) explored the relationship between performance in a novel task of executive function (Wake Forest Maze Task – WFMT) and a well-established assessment of working memory (Delayed Response Task – DR Task); and 3) examined the association between baseline gait speed with executive function and working memory at one-year follow-up. We found 1) physical and cognitive declines with age; 2) strong agreement between performance in the novel WFMT and DR task; and 3) that slow gait predicted poor cognitive performance in both domains. Our results suggest that older-aged vervets exhibit a coordinated suite of traits consistent with human aging and that slow gait may be a risk factor for cognitive decline.

Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration.

Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent.

Udell, Angel Garcia Martinez, Tengfei Wang, Jie Ni, Christian Hurt, Megan Mulligan, Eva E. Redei, Hao Chen",2020.09.25.313858;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.313858,"The tail immersion assay is a widely used method for measuring acute thermal pain in a way which is quantifiable and reproducible. It is non-invasive and measures response to a stimulus that may be encountered by an animal in its natural environment. However, tail withdrawal latency data are usually collected manually, and precise temperatures of the water at the time of measurement are most often not recorded. These two factors can reduce the reproducibility of tail immersion assay data. We designed a device, TailTimer, which uses the Raspberry Pi single-board computer and a temperature sensor, to automatically record both tail withdrawal latency and water temperature. The device has a radio frequency identification (RFID) system that can record the ID of animals. Our software recognizes several specific RFID keys as user interface commands, which allows TailTimer to be operated via RFID fobs. We also programmed the device to only allow tests to be conducted when the water is within ± 0.25 °C of the target temperature. Data recorded using the TailTimer device showed a linear relationship between tail withdrawal latency and water temperature when tested between 47 - 50 °C. We also observed a profound effect of water mixing speed on tail withdrawal latency. Our data further revealed significant strain and sex differences, valorizing TailTimer in its ability to detect genetically-determined variations in thermal pain sensitivity.Significance Statement Quantification of tail withdrawal latency in response to thermal pain has essentially remained the same since the method was first introduced decades ago and relies on manual recording of water temperature and tail withdrawal latency. Such manual methods engender relatively substantial variability and are potential contributors to some of the discrepancies present among relevant research. The open source TailTimer device we report here is simple and inexpensive to manufacture. The RFID-based user interface is ergonomic, especially in animal facilities where space is limited and gloves are mandatory. We anticipate that the increased reproducibility of tail withdrawal latency provided by TailTimer will augment its utility in nociception and addiction research.",568,65,156,11.0

Thus far, the estimation of subjective values in animals has relied upon repeated choices and was expressed as an average from dozens of stochastic decisions. However, decisions are made moment-to-moment, and their consequences are usually felt immediately. Here we describe a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like mechanism that encourages animals to truthfully reveal their subjective value in individual choices. The monkeys reliably placed well-ranked BDM bids for up to five juice volumes while paying from a water budget. The bids closely approximated the average subjective values estimated with conventional binary choices, thus demonstrating procedural invariance and aligning with the wealth of knowledge acquired with these less direct estimates. The feasibility of BDM bidding in monkeys encourages single-trial neuronal studies and bridges the gap to the widely used BDM method in human neuroeconomics.",1060,369,305,34.0

We find humans and rats are remarkably similar in patterns of choice in the task. The patterns in their choices, dwell maps and changes over time reveal that both species show the greatest similarity to RL agents utilising a predictive map: the successor representation.

These changes are often induced by components of the male ejaculate, such as sperm and seminal fluid proteins.However, males can vary significantly in their ejaculates, due to factors such as age, mating history, or nutritional status. This male variation may therefore lead to variation in the strength of responses males can stimulate in females, with alterations in fitness outcomes for both sexes.Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we tested whether three aspects of male condition shape an important, but understudied, post-mating response – increased female-female aggression.We found that females mated to old males fought less than females mated to young males. This effect was exacerbated in mates of old, sexually active males, but there was no effect of male starvation status on mating-induced female aggression. There was also a significant effect of age and mating history on female post-mating feeding duration.Our results add to a growing body of literature that variation in male condition can shape sexual selection through post-mating responses in females, including female-female interactions.

We previously identified a genetic risk variant for cocaine addiction in the PLCB1 gene and found this gene upregulated in postmortem brains of cocaine abusers and in human dopaminergic neuron-like cells after an acute cocaine exposure. Here, we functionally tested the contribution of PLCB1 gene to cocaine addictive properties in mice.Experimental approach We used heterozygous Plcb1 knockout mice (Plcb1+/-) and characterized their behavioral phenotype. Subsequently, mice were trained for operant conditioning and self-administered cocaine for 10 days. Plcb1+/- mice were assessed for cocaine motivation, followed by 26 days of extinction and finally evaluated for cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Gene expression alterations after reinstatement were assessed in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) by RNAseq.Key Results Plcb1+/- mice showed normal behavior, although they had increased anxiety and impaired short-term memory. Importantly, after cocaine self-administration and extinction, we found a reduction in the cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in Plcb1+/- mice. After reinstatement, we identified transcriptomic alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex of Plcb1+/- mice, mostly related to pathways relevant to addiction like the dopaminergic synapse and long-term potentiation.Conclusions and Implications To conclude, we found that heterozygous deletion of the Plcb1 gene decreases cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, pointing at PLCB1 as a possible therapeutic target for preventing relapse and treating cocaine addiction.",1203,212,274,38.0

Here we tested the hypothesis that nitrate and nitrite treatment would improve indicators of learning and cognitive performance in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. We also explored the extent to which nitrate and nitrite treatment affected the brain metabolome in order to understand how nitrate and nitrite supplementation may affect indices of cognitive function.Methods Fish were exposed to sodium nitrate (606.9 mg/L), sodium nitrite (19.5 mg/L), or control water for 2-4 weeks and free swim, startle response, innate predator avoidance, social cohesion, and shuttle box assays were performed.Results Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not change fish weight, length, predator avoidance, or distance and velocity traveled in an unstressed environment. Nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish initially experienced more negative reinforcement and increased time to decision in the shuttle box assay, which is consistent with a decrease in associative learning or executive function however, over multiple trials, all treatment groups demonstrated behaviors associated with learning. Nitrate and nitrite treatment significantly increased anxiety-like behavior but did not alter epinephrine, norepinephrine or dopamine levels. Targeted LC-MS/MS analysis revealed no significant increase in brain nitrate or nitrite concentrations with treatment. An untargeted metabolomics analysis found 47 metabolites whose abundance was significantly altered in the brain with nitrate and nitrite treatment including an 18-19% reduction in the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 17-22% reduction in its precursor, glutamine, which may contribute to the increased anxiety-like behavior.Conclusion Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not adversely affect multiple parameters of zebrafish health but was associated with mild anxiety-like behavior, changes in the brain metabolome, and caused a short-term decrease in executive function or associative learning.",693,318,263,45.0

For accurate circadian rhythms, endogenous oscillations are synchronized to light and temperature. In social insects, both abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., social interactions) play a significant role in active/rest rhythm regulation. However, it is challenging to monitor individual active-rest rhythms in a colony because of the large group size and small body size. Therefore, it is unclear how social interactions coordinate each individual’s active/rest rhythms. This study developed an image-based tracking system using 2D barcodes for &lt;I&gt;Diacamma&lt;/I&gt; sp.

We also investigated the effect of broods on active/rest rhythms by removing all broods under colony conditions. Active/rest rhythms appeared only in solitary ants, not under colony conditions.

Goerlitz",727248;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/727248,"Urbanization exposes wild animals to increased levels of light, affecting particularly nocturnal animals. Artificial light at night might shift the balance of predator-prey interactions, for example of nocturnal echolocating bats and eared moths. Moths exposed to light show less last-ditch manoeuvres in response to attacking close-by bats. In contrast, the extent to which negative phonotaxis, moths’ first line of defence against distant bats, is affected by light is unclear. Here, we aimed to quantify the overall effect of light on both types of sound-evoked anti-predator flight, last-ditch manoeuvres and negative phonotaxis. We caught moths at two light traps, which were alternately equipped with loudspeakers that presented ultrasonic playbacks to simulate hunting bats. The light field was omnidirectional to attract moths equally from all directions. In contrast, the sound field was directional and thus, depending on the moth’s approach direction, elicited either only negative phonotaxis, or negative phonotaxis and last-ditch manoeuvres. We did not observe an effect of sound playback on the number of caught moths, suggesting that light might suppress both types of anti-predator flight, as either type would have caused a decline in the number of caught moths. As control, we confirmed that our playback was able to elicit evasive flight in moths in a dark flight room. Showing no effect of a treatment, however, is difficult.

How task allocation is achieved is the most fascinating question in behavioural ecology and complex systems science. However, it is difficult to comprehensively characterise task allocation patterns due to behavioural complexity, such as the individual variation, context dependency, and chronological variation. Thus, it is imperative to quantify individual behaviours and integrate them into colony levels. Here, we applied bipartite network analyses to characterise individual-behaviour relationships. We recorded the behaviours of all individuals with verified age in ant colonies and analysed the individual-behaviour relationship at the individual, module, and network levels. Bipartite network analysis successfully detected the module structures, illustrating that certain individuals performed a subset of behaviours (i.e., task groups). We confirmed age polyethism by comparing age between modules. Additionally, to test the daily rhythm of the executed tasks, the data were partitioned between daytime and nighttime, and a bipartite network was re-constructed. This analysis supported that there was no daily rhythm in the tasks performed. These findings suggested that bipartite network analyses could untangle complex task allocation patterns and provide insights into understanding the division of labour.",1078,165,305,21.0

The periodicity of the season-like oscillation is in the range of 2-4 months (on average 97 days across cohorts of cages) and off-sets also responses to environmental stimuli but does not significantly alter the preference for activity during the dark hours of this nocturnal mouse strain (P=0.11 difference between highs and lows).The significance of this hitherto not recognized slow rhythmic alteration in spontaneous activity is further substantiated by its co-variation with the feeding behaviour of the mice. The absence of coordination within and between cohorts of cages or synchronization to the seasons of the year, suggests that the oscillation of in-cage activity and behavioural responses is generated by a free-running intrinsic oscillator devoid of synchronization with an out-of-cage environmental time-keeper. Since the variation over time has such a magnitude and correlate with the feeding behaviour it is likely that it will impact a range of long term experiments conducted on laboratory mice if left unrecognized.",498,226,134,27.0

However, they have not been considered in the original discovery of ZD strategies. In some preceding studies, each of them has been considered independently. Here, we analytically study the strategies that enforce linear payoff relationships in the RPD game considering both a discount factor and observation errors.

Non-invasive techniques are preferred for these purposes as they reduce opportunities for research apparatus to interfere with behaviour. One potentially valuable approach is image-based tracking. However, the complexity of tracking unmarked wild animals using video is challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments. Out-of-the-box algorithms currently present several problems in this context that can compromise accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion in a 3D environment. To address the issue, we present a novel hybrid detection and tracking algorithm to monitor unmarked insects outdoors. Our software can detect an insect, identify when a tracked insect becomes occluded from view and when it re-emerges, determine when an insect exits the camera field of view, and our software assembles a series of insect locations into a coherent trajectory. The insect detecting component of the software uses background subtraction and deep learning-based detection together to accurately and efficiently locate the insect among a cluster of wildflowers.We applied our method to track honeybees foraging outdoors using a new dataset that includes complex background detail, wind-blown foliage, and insects moving into and out of occlusion beneath leaves and among three-dimensional plant structures. We evaluated our software against human observations and previous techniques. It tracked honeybees at a rate of 86.6% on our dataset, 43% higher than the computationally more expensive, standalone deep learning model YOLOv2. We illustrate the value of our approach to quantify fine-scale foraging of honeybees. The ability to track unmarked insect pollinators in this way will help researchers better understand pollination ecology.

Here we ask whether animals can adapt their behaviour to either exploit or avoid areas of their environment with increased dynamic visual noise. By immersing three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) into environments with a simulated form of naturally occurring visual noise – light bands created by the refraction of light from surface waves termed caustic networks – we tested how such visual noise affected the movements, habitat use, and perceptual abilities of these fish. Fish avoided areas of higher visual noise, and achieved this by increasing their activity as a function of the locally perceived noise level, resulting in individuals moving away from noisier areas. By projecting virtual prey into the environment with different levels of visual noise, we found that the fish’s ability to visually detect prey decreased as visual noise increased. We found no evidence that fish increased their exploration (and decreased their refuge use) in environments with increased visual noise, which would have been predicted if they were exploiting increased visual noise to reduce their own likelihood of being detected. Our results indicate that animals can use simple behavioural strategies to mitigate the impacts of dynamic visual noise on their perceptual abilities, thereby improving their likelihood of gathering information in dynamically changing and noisy environments.",785,63,246,28.0

One mechanism proposed to explain heightened levels of alcohol intake in AmED users is that the high levels of caffeine found in energy drinks may increase the reinforcing properties of alcohol, an effect which may be dependent on interactions between adenosine signaling pathways and the dopamine D2 receptor. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to confirm whether caffeine increases the reinforcing efficacy of alcohol using both fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) designs, and to investigate a potential role of the dopamine D2 receptor in caffeine’s reinforcement-enhancing effects. Male Long Evans rats were trained to self-administer a sweetened alcohol or sucrose solution on an FR2 schedule of reinforcement. Pretreatment with caffeine (5-10 mg/kg) significantly increased operant responding for the sweetened alcohol reinforcer, but not sucrose. PR tests of motivation for alcohol or sucrose likewise confirmed a caffeine-dependent increase in motivation for a sweetened alcohol solution, but not sucrose. However, the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride did not block the reinforcementenhancing effects of caffeine using either an FR or PR schedule of reinforcement. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that caffeine increases the reinforcing efficacy of alcohol, which may explain caffeine-induced increases in alcohol intake.

However, many scientific, regulatory and ethical questions remain before transgenic mosquitoes can be utilised in the field. Mutations which reduce an individual’s reproductive success are likely to create strong selective pressures to evolve resistance. It is thus crucial that the targeted population collapses as rapidly and as completely as possible to reduce the available time for the emergence of drive-resistant mutations. At a behavioural level, this means that the gene-drive carrying mutants should be at least as (and ideally more) sexually attractive than the wildtype population they compete against. A key element in the copulatory negotiations of Anopheles mosquitoes is their acoustic courtship. We therefore analysed sound emissions and acoustic preference in a doublesex mutant previously used to successfully collapse caged colonies of Anopheles gambiae s.l..Methods The flight tones produced by the beating of their wings form the signals for acoustic mating communication in Anopheles species. We assessed the acoustic impact of the disruption of a female-specific isoform of the doublesex gene (dsxF) on the wing beat frequency (WBF; measured as flight tone) of both males (XY) and females (XX) in homozygous dsxF- mutants (dsxF-/-), heterozygous dsxF- carriers (dsxF+/-) and G3 ‘wildtype’ dsxF+ controls (dsxF+/+). To exclude non-genetic influences, we controlled for temperature and measured wing lengths for all experimental animals. We used a phonotaxis assay to test the acoustic preferences of mutant and control mosquitoes.Results A previous study demonstrated an altered phenotype only for females homozygous for the disrupted dsx allele (dsxF-/-), who appear intersex. No phenotypic changes were observed for heterozygous carriers or males, suggesting that the female-specific dsxF allele is haplosufficient. We here identify significant, dose-dependent increases in the flight tones of both dsxF-/- and dsxF+/- females when compared to dsxF+/+ control females. Flight tone frequencies in all three female genotypes remained significantly lower than in males, however. When tested experimentally, males showed stronger phonotactic responses to the flight tones of control dsxF+/+ females. While flight tones from dsxF+/- and dsxF-/- females also elicited positive phonotactic behaviour in males, this was significantly reduced compared to responses to control tones. We found no evidence of phonotactic behaviour in any female genotype tested. None of the male genotypes displayed any deviations from the control condition.Conclusions A key prerequisite for copulation in anopheline mosquitoes is the phonotactic attraction of males towards female flight tones within large - spatially and acoustically crowded - mating swarms. Reductions in acoustic attractiveness of released mutant lines, as reported here for heterozygous dsxF+/- females, reduce the line’s mating efficiency, and could consequently reduce the efficacy of the associated population control effort. Assessments of caged populations may not successfully reproduce the challenges posed by natural mating scenarios. We propose to amend existing testing protocols in order to more faithfully reflect the competitive conditions between a mutant line and the wildtype population it is meant to interact with. This should also include novel tests of ‘acoustic fitness’. In line with previous studies, our findings confirm that disruption of the female-specific isoform dsxF has no effect on males; for some phenotypic traits, such as female flight tones, however, the effects of dsxF appear to be dose-dependent rather than haplosufficient.",945,63,198,30.0

The currently best models of attention control are deep networks trained on free-viewing behavior to predict bottom-up attention control—saliency. We introduce COCO-Search18, the first dataset of laboratory-quality goal-directed behavior large enough to train deep-network models. We collected eye-movement behavior from 10 people searching for each of 18 target-object categories in 6202 natural-scene images, yielding ∼300,000 search fixations. We thoroughly characterize COCO-Search18, and benchmark it using three machine-learning methods: a ResNet50 object detector, a ResNet50 trained on fixation-density maps, and an inverse-reinforcement-learning model trained on behavioral search scanpaths. Models were also trained/tested on images transformed to approximate a foveated retina, a fundamental biological constraint. These models, each having a different reliance on behavioral training, collectively comprise the new state-of-the-art in predicting goal-directed search fixations. Our expectation is that future work using COCO-Search18 will far surpass these initial efforts, finding applications in domains ranging from human-computer interactive systems that can anticipate a person’s intent and render assistance to the potentially early identification of attention-related clinical disorders (ADHD, PTSD, phobia) based on deviation from neurotypical fixation behavior.",1064,172,468,31.0

One of the key challenges is to understand how consistently cognitive traits within any one domain are expressed over time and across different contexts, as this has direct implications for the way in which selection might act on this variation. Animal studies typically measure a cognitive domain using only one task in one context, and assume that this captures the likely expression of that domain in different contexts. This deficit is not surprising because, from an ecologist’s perspective, cognitive tasks are notoriously laborious to employ, and for design reasons most tasks can only be deployed in a specific context. Thus our knowledge of whether individual differences in cognitive abilities are consistent across contexts is limited. Using a wild population of great tits (Parus major) we characterised consistency of two cognitive abilities, each in two different contexts: 1) spatial learning at two different spatial scales, and 2) behavioural flexibility as both performance in a detour reaching task and reversal learning in a spatial task. We found no evidence of a correlation between the two spatial learning speeds, or between the two measures of behavioural flexibility. This suggests that cognitive performance is highly plastic and sensitive to differences across tasks, or that variants of these well-known tasks may tap into different combinations of both cognitive and non-cognitive mechanisms, or that they simply do not adequately measure each putative cognitive domain. Our results highlight the challenges of developing standardised cognitive assays to explain natural behaviour and to understand the selective consequences of that variation.",788,93,263,24.0

Here, we investigate the influence of local weather conditions on flight behaviour of dragonflies in Europe, taking advantage of large movements of dragonflies occurring along the Baltic Sea coast of Latvia. Firstly, we performed orientation tests with individual dragonflies of two commonly captured species, Aeshna mixta and Sympetrum vulgatum, in order to determine if dragonflies showed directed flight and whether flight direction was independent from wind direction. Aeshna mixta displayed a uniform mean southward orientation (166.7°), independent from prevailing wind directions, whereas S. vulgatum did not show a uniform orientation. Secondly, we investigated the influence of weather conditions on the abundance of dragonflies captured. Behavioural differences in relation to weather conditions were observed between A. mixta and the two smaller Sympetrum species (S. vulgatum and S. sanguineum). Generally, temperature, cloud cover and wind direction were the most important predictors for migration intensity, with temperature positively influencing abundance and cloud cover negatively influencing abundance. Aeshna mixta appeared to select favourable tailwinds (northerlies), whereas hourly abundance of Sympetrum increased with more easterly winds. Our results provide important information on the influence of local weather conditions on the flight behaviour of dragonflies, as well as evidence of migration for A. mixta and most likely some Sympetrum species along the Baltic coast.",758,309,248,34.0

Biological invaders capable of vocal learning are useful for testing this possibility, as invasion alters population size. If vocal learning is used for individual recognition, then individual identity should be encoded in frequency modulation patterns of acoustic signals. Furthermore, frequency modulation patterns should be more complex in larger social groups, reflecting greater selection for individual distinctiveness. We compared social group sizes and used supervised machine learning and frequency contours to compare contact call structure between native range monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) in Uruguay and invasive range populations in the U.S. Invasive range sites exhibited fewer nests and simpler frequency modulation patterns. Beecher’s statistic revealed reduced individual identity content and fewer possible unique individual signatures in invasive range calls. Lower estimated social densities and simpler individual signatures are consistent with relaxed selection on the complexity of calls learned for individual recognition in smaller social groups. These findings run counter to the traditional view that vocal learning is used for imitation, and suggest that vocal learning can be employed to produce individual vocal signatures in a manner sensitive to local population size.",592,55,135,13.0

Curiously, the lateral periaqueductal gray (LPAG) has been implicated in driving both responses. The LPAG responds to social threats and prey hunting while also drives predatory attacks and active defense. However, the LPAG neural mechanisms mediating these behaviors remain poorly defined. Here, we investigate how the LPAG mediates the choices of predatory hunting and evasion from a social threat. Pharmacogenetic inhibition in Fos DD-Cre mice of neurons responsive specifically to insect predation (IP) or social defeat (SD) revealed that distinct neuronal populations in the LPAG drive the prey hunting and evasion from social threats. We show that the LPAG provides massive glutamatergic projection to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Optogenetic inhibition of the LPAG-LHA pathway impaired IP but did not alter escape/attack ratio during SD. We also found that pharmacogenetic inhibition of LHAGABA neurons impaired IP, but did not change evasion during SD. The results suggest that the LPAG control over evasion to a social attack may be regarded as a stereotyped response depending probably on glutamatergic descending projections. On the other hand, the LPAG control over predatory behavior involves an ascending glutamatergic pathway to the LHA that likely influences LHAGABA neurons driving predatory attack and prey consumption. The LPAG-LHA path supposedly provides an emotional drive for prey hunting and, of relevance, may conceivably have more widespread control on the motivational drive to seek other appetitive rewards.",845,82,259,30.0

Maternal glucocorticoids (GCs) may convert environmental cues experienced by the mother into a cue triggering adaptive developmental plasticity in offspring. In North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), females exhibit increases in GCs when conspecific density is elevated, and selection favors more aggressive and perhaps more active mothers under high density conditions. We experimentally elevated maternal GCs during gestation or early lactation to test the hypothesis that elevated maternal GCs cause shifts in offspring aggression and activity that may prepare them for high density conditions. When offspring were weaned, we measured two behavioral traits (activity and aggression) using a standardized behavioral assay. Because maternal GCs may influence offspring hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and HPA axis activity may in turn affect offspring behavior, we also measured the impact of our treatments on offspring HPA axis activity (adrenal reactivity and negative feedback) and the association between offspring HPA axis activity and behavior. Increased maternal GCs during lactation, but not gestation, only slightly elevated activity levels in offspring. Offspring aggression, adrenal reactivity, and negative feedback did not differ between GC-treated and control groups. Offspring with higher adrenal reactivity did exhibit lower aggression, but the relationship between adrenal reactivity and aggression was not affected by treatment with maternal GCs. These results suggest maternal GCs during gestation or early lactation alone may not be a sufficient cue to produce changes in behavioral and physiological stress responses in offspring in natural populations.Summary Statement We found maternal glucocorticoid levels do not influence offspring personality or HPA axis dynamics in North American red squirrels. Regardless of maternal glucocorticoid treatment, more aggressive squirrels exhibited lower adrenal reactivity.",519,59,150,37.0

MacIver",626549;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/626549,"The escape maneuvers of animals are key determinants of their survival. Consequently these maneuvers are under intense selection pressure. Current work indicates that a number of escape maneuver parameters contribute to survival including response latency, escape speed, and direction. This work has found that the relative importance of these parameters is context dependent, suggesting that interactions between escape maneuver parameters and the predatory context together determine the likelihood of escape success. However, it is unclear how escape maneuver parameters interact to contribute to escape success across different predatory contexts. To clarify these issues, we investigated the determinants of successful escape maneuvers by analyzing the responses of larval zebrafish to the attacks of dragonfly nymphs. We found that the strongest predictor of the outcome was the time needed for the nymph to reach the fish’s initial position at the onset of the attack, measured from the time that the fish initiates its escape response. We show how this result is related to the intersection of the swept volume of the nymph’s grasping organs with the volume containing all possible escape trajectories of the fish. By analyzing the intersection of these volumes, we compute the survival benefit of recruiting the Mauthner cell, a neuron in anamniotes devoted to producing escapes. We discuss how escape maneuver parameters interact in determining escape response. The intersection of motor volume approach provides a framework that unifies the influence of many escape maneuver parameters on the likelihood of survival.",1291,261,546,37.0

However, there is no evidence on the role of kinin receptors in depressive-like and nociceptive behavior in female mice submitted to bilateral ovariectomy. This study shows that ovariectomized mice (OVX) developed time-related mechanical allodynia and increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST). The genetic deletion of B1R, or the pharmacological blockade by selective kinin B1R antagonist R-715 (acute, i.p), reduced the increase of immobility time and mechanical allodynia induced by ovariectomy. Neither genetic deletion nor pharmacological inhibition of B2R (HOE 140, i.p) prevented the behavioral changes elicited by OVX. Our data suggested a particular modulation of kinin B1R in the nociceptive and depressive-like behavior in ovariectomized mice.

The free-running periods and amplitude (sometimes called strength or power) of circadian rhythms are often used as indicators of biological clocks. Many reports have shown that these traits highly geographically variable, and interestingly, they often show latitudinal or altitudinal clines. In many cases, the higher the latitude is, the longer the free-running circadian period (i.e., period of rhythm) in insects and plants. However, reports of positive correlations between latitude or longitude and circadian rhythm traits, including free-running periods, the power of the rhythm and locomotor activity, are limited to certain taxonomic groups. Therefore, we collected a cosmopolitan stored-product pest species, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, in various parts of Japan and examined its rhythm traits, including the power of the rhythm and period of the rhythm, which were calculated from locomotor activity. The analysis revealed that power was significantly lower for beetles collected in northern areas compared with southern areas in Japan.

Patagial (wing) tags have been extensively used as a marking method for visual resightings in endangered vulture species, but their effect on the aerodynamics of the birds and their flight behaviour is yet to be investigated. Using GPS backpack mounted devices, we compared the flight performance of 27 captive and wild Cape Vultures (Gyps coprotheres), marked with either patagial tags or coloured leg bands.Results Individuals equipped with patagial tags were less likely to fly, travelled shorter distances and flew slower compared to individuals equipped with leg bands.

Lucas",2020.02.24.961565;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.961565,"SummaryInstinctive defensive behaviours, consisting of stereotyped sequences of movements and postures, are an essential component of the mouse behavioural repertoire. Since defensive behaviours can be reliably triggered by threatening sensory stimuli, the selection of the most appropriate action depends on the stimulus property. However, since the mouse has a wide repertoire of motor actions, it is not clear which set of movements and postures represent the relevant action. So far this has been empirically identified as a change in locomotion state. However, the extent to which locomotion alone captures the diversity of defensive behaviours and their sensory specificity is unknown.To tackle this problem we developed a method to obtain a faithful 3D reconstruction of the mouse body that enabled to quantify a wide variety of motor actions. This higher dimensional description revealed that defensive behaviours are more stimulus-specific than indicated by locomotion data. Thus, responses to distinct stimuli that were equivalent in terms of locomotion (e.g. freezing induced by looming and sound) could be discriminated along other dimensions. The enhanced stimulus-specificity was explained by a surprising diversity. A clustering analysis revealed that distinct combinations of movements and postures, giving rise to at least 7 different behaviours, were required to account for stimulus-specificity. Moreover, each stimulus evoked more than one behaviour revealing a robust one-to-many mapping between sensations and behaviours that was not apparent from locomotion data. Our results indicate that diversity and sensory specificity of mouse defensive behaviours unfold in a higher dimensional space spanning multiple motor actions.",2081,330,647,39.0

Identifying such conserved patterns occurring rarely in noisy behavioral data is key to understanding the behavioral response to a distributed stimulus in unrestrained animals. Existing models seek to describe the dynamics of behavior or segment individual locomotor episodes rather than to identify occasional, transient irregularities that make up the behavioral response. To fill this gap, we develop a lexical, hierarchical model of behavior. We designed an unsupervised algorithm called “BASS” to efficiently identify and segment conserved behavioral action sequences transiently occurring in long behavioral recordings. When applied to navigating larval zebrafish, BASS extracts a dictionary of remarkably long, non-Markovian sequences consisting of repeats and mixtures of slow forward and turn bouts. Applied to a novel chemotaxis assay, BASS uncovers conserved chemotactic strategies deployed by zebrafish to avoid aversive cues consisting of sequences of fast large-angle turns and burst swims. In a simulated dataset of soaring gliders climbing thermals, BASS finds the spiralling patterns characteristic of soaring behavior. In both cases, BASS succeeds in identifying action sequences that are highly conserved but transient in the behavior deployed by freely moving animals. BASS can be easily incorporated into the pipelines of existing behavioral analyses across diverse species, and even more broadly used as a generic algorithm for pattern recognition in low-dimensional sequential data.",1431,181,1821,45.0

Our findings support the hypothesis that T. gondii’s manipulation of host boldness is an extended phenotype that promotes parasite transmission from intermediate hosts to feline predators. While upregulating hyena boldness toward lions might achieve this, it may also reflect a collateral influence of manipulative traits that evolved in other hosts (e.g., rodents).

To this end, we tested the efficacy of feeding, sensory and manipulable enrichment interventions on the welfare of Asiatic lions at the conservation breeding centre of Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Gujarat. We adopted a holistic approach by measuring physiological and behavioural responses of 35 captive Asiatic lions, divided into control (n=16) and test (n=19) groups. The test subjects approached feeding devices first and manipulable devices for a longer duration. Manipulable devices were used homogenously with two significant time peaks, but sensory devices were used sporadically throughout the day with no discernible peak usage. The control subjects remained unchanged in all welfare parameters compared to their pre-treatment levels. However, post-enrichment behavioural assessments showed higher behaviour diversity (95% increase from the baseline period), reduced enclosure zone bias (40.25% reduction) and aberrant repetitive behaviours (80.68%) in test samples. Similarly, faecal corticosterone measures showed lower stress levels in test samples (58% decrease), confirming significant improvement in all welfare indices than control groups. These results have universal applicability to assess welfare indices of other captive species in Indian zoos.

This sexually dimorphic behavior suggests that mice change their vocal behavior in response to the social context, and their perception of the context is based on social cognition and memory.

Across 222 studies, the strength of mate choice was significantly context-dependent, and most influenced by population density, population sex ratio, and predation risk. However, the average effect sizes were typically small. The amount of sexual signalling and the strength of response to sexual signals were not significantly related to the environment.

One experiment that gives insight to animals’ use of causal mechanisms is the stone-dropping task. In this, subjects are given an opportunity to push a platform to make it collapse and are then required to innovate dropping a stone tool to recreate the platform collapsing (von Bayern et al., 2009). We describe how 16/18 subjects of two species of macaw (n=18; Ara ambiguus (n=9) &amp; Ara glaucogularis (n=9)) were able to innovate the solution in this task. Many of the subjects were able to innovate the behaviour through exploratory object combination, but it is also possible that a mechanistic understanding of the necessity for contact with the platform influenced some subjects’ behaviour. All the successful subjects were able to recreate their novel stone-dropping behaviour in the first or second trial after innovation (and all trials thereafter) and they were also able to do the behaviour increasingly faster. This suggests they also rely on learned associations of cause and effect. However, in a transfer task in which subjects had to guide a stick tool to make it touch a differently positioned platform, all but one of the subjects failed. This would suggest that the majority of the subjects were not using an understanding of platform contact to solve the task, although the subjects’ difficulty with using stick tools may have also affected their performance in this transfer.",680,82,167,46.0

Here, the ventriloquism effect (VE) and aftereffect (VAE) were used to study these processes in a real reverberant environment. Auditory and audio-visual (AV) stimuli were presented, in interleaved trials, over a range of distances from 0.7 to 2.04 m in front of the listener, whose task was to judge the distance of auditory stimuli or of the auditory components of AV stimuli. The relative location of the visual and auditory components of AV stimuli was fixed within a session such that the visual component was presented from distance 30% closer (V-closer) than the auditory component, 30% farther (V-farther), or aligned (V-aligned). The study examined the strength of VE and VAE as a function of the reference distance and of the direction of the visual component displacement, and the temporal profile of the build-up/break-down of these effects. All observed effects were approximately independent of target distance when expressed in logarithmic units. The VE strength, measured in the AV trials, was roughly constant for both directions of visual-component displacement such that, on average, the responses shifted in the direction of the visual component by 72% of the audio-visual disparity. The VAE strength, measured on the interleaved auditory-only trials, was stronger in the V-farther than the V-closer condition (44% vs. 31% of the audio-visual disparity, respectively). The VAE persisted to post-adaptation auditory-only blocks of trials, however it was weaker and the V-farther/V-closer asymmetry was reduced. The rates of build-up/break-down of the VAE were also asymmetrical, with slower adaptation in the V-closer condition. These results suggest that, on a logarithmic scale, the AV distance integration is symmetrical, independent of the direction of induced shift, while the visually-induced auditory distance re-callibration is asymmetrical, stronger and faster when evoked by more distant visual stimuli.",506,59,109,28.0

Collett",2020.08.21.261354;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.261354,"SummaryThe prevailing account of visually controlled routes is that an ant learns views as it follows a route, while guided by other path-setting mechanisms. Once a set of route views is memorised, the insect follows the route by turning and moving forwards when the view on the retina matches a stored view. We have engineered a situation in which this account cannot suffice in order to discover whether there may be additional components to the performance of routes. One-eyed wood ants were trained to navigate a short route in the laboratory guided by a single black, vertical bar placed in the blinded visual field. Ants thus had to turn away from the route to see the bar. They often turned to look at or beyond the bar and then turned to face in the direction of the goal. Tests in which the bar was shifted to be more peripheral or more frontal than in training produced a corresponding change in the ants’ paths, demonstrating that they were guided by the bar, presumably obtaining information during scanning turns towards the bar. Examination of the endpoints of turns away from the bar suggest that ants use the bar for guidance by learning how large a turn-back is needed to face the goal. We suggest that the ants’ zigzag paths are an integral part of visually guided route following. In addition, on some runs in which ants did not take a direct path to the goal, they still turned to face and sometimes approach the goal for a short stretch. This off-route goal facing indicates that they store a vector from start to goal and use path integration to track their position relative to the endpoint of the vector.",543,73,167,30.0

Dougherty,2020.08.21.261081;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.261081,"Animals often need to signal to attract mates, and sexual signalling may impose significant energetic and fitness costs to signallers. Consequently, individuals should strategically adjust signalling effort in order to maximise the fitness payoffs of signalling. An important determinant of these payoffs is individual state, which can influence the resources available to signallers, the likelihood of mating, and the motivation to mate. However, empirical studies often find contradictory patterns of state-based signalling. For example, some studies find that individuals in poor condition signal less, in order to conserve resources (ability-based signalling). In other cases, individuals in poor condition signal more, in order to maximise short-term reproductive success (needs-based signalling). I used meta-analysis to examine animal sexual signalling behaviour in relation to six aspects of individual state: age, mated status, attractiveness, body size, condition, and parasite load. Across 228 studies and 147 species, individuals (who were overwhelmingly male) signalled significantly more when in good condition, and there was a strong positive trend for increased signalling for large, attractive individuals with a low parasite load. Overall, this suggests that animal sexual signalling behaviour is generally honest and ability-based. However, needs-based signalling (terminal investment) was found when considering age, with old virgins signalling more than young virgins. Sexual signalling was not significantly influenced by mated status. There was a large amount of heterogeneity across studies that remained unexplained, and therefore more work is needed to determine the ecological factors influencing the magnitude and direction of state-dependent sexual signalling.",687,81,222,47.0

In a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified a locus that influenced the stimulant response to methamphetamine. That locus was also an eQTL for the gene Azi2. Based on those findings, we hypothesized that heritable differences in the expression of Azi2 were causally related to the differential response to methamphetamine. In this study, we created a mutant Azi2 allele that caused lower Azi2 expression and enhanced the locomotor response to methamphetamine; however, based on the GWAS findings, we had expected lower Azi2 to decrease rather than increase the stimulant response to methamphetamine. We then sought to explore the mechanism by which Azi2 influenced methamphetamine sensitivity. A recent publication had reported that the 3’UTR of Azi2 mRNA downregulates the expression of Slc6a3, which encodes the dopamine transporter (DAT), which is a key target of methamphetamine. We evaluated the relationship between Azi2/Azi2 3’UTR and Slc6a3 expression in the VTA in the mutant Azi2 mice and in a new cohort of CFW mice. We did not observe any correlation between Azi2 and Slc6a3 in the VTA in either cohort. However, RNA sequencing confirmed that the Azi2 mutation altered Azi2 expression and also revealed a number of potentially important genes and pathways that were regulated by Azi2, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor group III pathway and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway. Our results support a role for Azi2 in methamphetamine sensitivity; however, the exact mechanism does not appear to involve regulation of Slc6a3 and thus remains unknown.",604,51,151,39.0

Here we show that mantis shrimp of the species Neogonodactylus oerstedii can learn the shape of a trained target. Furthermore, when the shape and color of a target which they had been trained to identify were placed in conflict, N. oerstedii significantly chose the target of the trained shape over the target of the trained color. Thus, we conclude that the shape of a target is more important than its color for its recognition by N. oerstedii. Our findings suggest that the shapes of learned structures, such as landmarks or other animals, are important for N. oerstedii during object recognition.",561,48,139,13.0

Chromosome mapping identified Scon3, located on Chr9, and epistasis of Scon3 with Scon4 on Chr1. Mice with different combinations of Scon3 and Scon4 genotypes differed more than threefold in sucrose intake. To understand how these two QTLs influenced sucrose intake, we measured resting metabolism, glucose and insulin tolerance, and peripheral taste responsiveness in congenic mice. We found that the combinations of Scon3 and Scon4 genotypes influenced thermogenesis and the oxidation of fat and carbohydrate. Results of glucose and insulin tolerance tests, peripheral taste tests, and gustatory nerve recordings ruled out plasma glucose homoeostasis and peripheral taste sensitivity as major contributors to the differences in voluntary sucrose consumption.

Of the laboratory animals used for research, 95 percent are mice and rats as reported by the Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR). We present here our work in developing wireless Artificial Intelligent (AI)-powered IoT Sensors (AIIS) for laboratory mice motion recognition utilizing embedded micro-inertial measurement units (uIMUs). Based on the AIIS, we have demonstrated a small-animal motion tracking and recognition system that could recognize 5 common behaviors of mice in cages with accuracy of ~76.23%. The key advantage of this AIIS-based system is to enable high throughput behavioral monitoring of multiple to a large group of laboratory animals, in contrast to traditional video tracking systems that usually track only single or a few animals at a time. The system collects motion data (i.e., three axes linear accelerations and three axes angular velocities) from the IoT sensors attached to different mice, and classifies these data into different behaviors using machine learning algorithms. One of the challenging problems for data analysis is that the distribution of behavior samples is extremely imbalanced. Behaviors such as sleeping and walking dominate the entire sample set from different mice. However, machine learning algorithms often require a balanced sample set to achieve optimal performance. Thus, several methods are proposed to solve the imbalanced sample problem. Data processing methods for data segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, imbalanced learning, and machine learning are explored to process motion data including sleeping, walking, rearing, digging, shaking, grooming, drinking and scratching. For example, by tuning the parameters of a machine-learning algorithm (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM)), the average accuracy of classifying five behaviors (i.e., sleeping, walking, rearing, digging and shaking) is 48.07% before solving the imbalance sample issue. To address this problem, an iteration of sample and feature selection is applied to improve the SVM performance. A combination of oversampling and undersampling is used to handle imbalanced classes, and feature selection provides the optimal number of features. The accuracy increases from 48.07% to 76.23% when the optimized combination is used.

How energy metabolism related to glucose decomposition and ATP production influences foraging behavior in termites is still unclear. Here, we analyzed the change in energy metabolism in the whole organism and brain after silencing the key metabolic gene isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and then investigated its impact on foraging behavior in the subterranean termite Odontotermes formosanus in different social contexts. The IDH gene exhibited higher expression in the abdomen and head of O. formosanus. The knockdown of IDH resulted in metabolic disorders in the whole organism, including the impairment of the NAD+-IDH reaction and decreased ATP levels and glucose accumulation. The dsIDH-injected workers showed significantly reduced walking activity but increased foraging success. Interestingly, IDH downregulation altered brain energy metabolism, resulting in a decline in ATP levels and an increase in IDH activity. Additionally, the social context obviously affected brain energy metabolism and, thus, altered foraging behavior in O. formosanus. We found that the presence of predator ants increased the negative influence on the foraging behavior of dsIDH-injected workers, including a decrease in foraging success. However, an increase in the number of nestmate soldiers could provide social buffering to relieve the adverse effect of predator ants on worker foraging behavior. Our orthogonal experiments further verified that the role of the IDH gene as an inherent factor was dominant in manipulating termite foraging behavior compared with external social contexts, suggesting that energy metabolism, especially brain energy metabolism, plays a crucial role in regulating termite foraging behavior.Author summary Foraging behavior plays a key role in collective survival in social insects, as found in termites. Worker termites are responsible for foraging duty and exhibit large foraging areas and long foraging distances, so they need to consume much energy during foraging. It is well established that energy can influence insect behaviors. However, how energy metabolism affects foraging behavior in termites remains unknown. Here, we found that the downregulation of the conserved metabolic gene IDH impaired whole-organism and the brain energy metabolism and further altered foraging behavior, resulting in decreased walking activity but increased foraging success in the termite O. formosanus, which is an important insect pest damaging embankments and trees in China. Additionally, the social context affected brain energy metabolism and obviously changed foraging behavior in O. formosanus, causing a decline in foraging success in the absence of nestmate soldiers and the presence of predator ants. However, the increasing number of nestmate soldiers strengthened social buffering to relieve the negative effect of predator ants on worker foraging behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanism involved in modulating the sophisticated foraging strategy of termites in different social contexts from the perspective of energy metabolism.",673,85,176,43.0

Several lines of evidence have suggested prolactin, a pituitary hormone released around the time of ejaculation in humans and other animals, to be a decisive player in the establishment of the refractory period. However, data supporting this hypothesis is controversial. We took advantage of two different strains of house mouse, a wild derived and a classical laboratory strain, that differ substantially in their sexual behavior, to investigate prolactin’s involvement in sexual motivation and the refractory period. First, we show that there is prolactin release during sexual behavior in male mice. Second, using a pharmacological approach, we show that acute manipulations of prolactin levels, either mimicking the natural release during sexual behavior or inhibiting its occurrence, do not affect sexual motivation or shorten the refractory period, respectively. Therefore, we show compelling evidence refuting the idea that prolactin released during copulation is involved in the establishment of the refractory period, a long-standing hypothesis in the field of behavioral endocrinology.",1239,70,1147,22.0

A host shift related with vector’s cognition often requires neural alterations by the virus. However, PYVV, being semi-persistent, is not supposed to directly affect vector physiology. As such, we propose that changes in potato plants caused by PYVV infection should manipulate insect behaviour to increase transmission. Here, we studied the effect of PYVV infection and symptom expression on GWF biological parameters, and attraction towards infected and uninfected potato plants. We compared survival and development rates of GWF nymphs fed with PYVV-infected plants (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and healthy plants under controlled conditions. We also carried out free-choice tests to determine host preference of GWF adults as a function of PYVV infection and disease symptom expression. We found that PYVV infection (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) reduce GWF survival while increasing development time (in symptomatic plants). Combined, a prolonged development time and reduced survival should favour viral uptake and trigger migration of vectors from symptomatic plants short after acquiring the virus. We also found that symptom expression (yellowing) causes significantly greater GWF attraction and establishment compared to healthy or asymptomatic plants. Interestingly, we found that GWF adults that have previously fed on infected plants switch their host preference choosing and establishing on healthy potato plants, which clearly increases horizontal transmission rates. The mechanism through which this behavioural manipulation takes place is not yet well understood. Our results show that symptoms associated with PYVV infection may account for a set of behavioural modifications that make an improbable vector, such as the GWF, into an efficient agent that increases horizontal transmission rates of PYVV.HighlightsPYVD reduces the survival of GWF and increases development time when symptoms occurPYVD symptom makes potato, a non-host plant, attractive to GWFAfter feeding on infected plants, GWF preference changes to prefer uninfected plantsPYVV modulates GWF behaviour to enhance horizontal transmission between plants",640,40,130,26.0

However, little is known about the extent to which experiences in one regime might influence decisions in another. To determine how a flies’ odor plume tracking during flight is related to their behavior after landing, I tracked the behavior of individually labelled fruit flies as they explored an array of three odor emitting, but food-barren, objects. The distance flies travelled on the objects in search of food was correlated with the time elapsed between their visits, suggesting that their in-flight plume tracking and on-foot local search behaviors are interconnected through a lossy memory-like process.",1099,85,341,12.0

Therefore, knowledge on the involved molecular processes downstream of OXT receptor (OXTR) activation is indispensable. We reveal that alternative splicing of corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2α (CRFR2α) parallels increased anxiety-like behavior following chronic OXT treatment, contrasting the well-known anxiolysis of acute OXT. In detail, chronic OXT shifts the splicing ratio between membrane-bound (mCRFR2α) and soluble CRFR2α (sCRFR2α) in favor of the latter via ERK1/2-MEF2A signaling. Targeted manipulations of Crfr2α splicing mimic the effect of chronic OXT, confirming its role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, chronic OXT triggers cytoplasmic distribution and extracellular release of sCRFR2α into the cerebrospinal fluid, with sCRFR2α levels positively correlating with anxiety-like behavior. Concluding, the dichotomy between anxiolytic mCRFR2α and anxiogenic sCRFR2α is the basis for the deleterious effects of chronic OXT on anxiety.",1178,157,330,42.0

We confirmed a sucrose consumption QTL (Scon2, or Sac) on mouse chromosome (Chr) 4, harboring the Tas1r3 gene, which encodes the sweet taste receptor subunit T1R3 and affects both behavioral and neural responses to sucrose. For sucrose consumption, we also detected five new main-effect QTLs Scon6 (Chr2), Scon7 (Chr5), Scon8 (Chr8), Scon3 (Chr9) and a sex-specific QTL Scon9 (Chr15), and an interacting QTL pair Scon4 (Chr1) and Scon3 (Chr9).

In humans, these services are constantly provided using a shift work strategy where different individuals, or groups of individuals perform their tasks at different times of the day. However, shift work strategy in job organization in other social organisms remains unclear. Previous studies in honeybees for two jobs support shift work for only pollen foragers and not for nursing behavior. Here we examined shift work dynamics for three types of jobs performed by honeybee foragers. Specifically, we studied pollen foragers, non-pollen foragers and bees fanning at the entrance of the colony, a job important for orientation and temperature control. Major features of the observed shift work were: 1) individuals can be divided into early and late shifts; 2) there are constant workers; 3) based on job, shift work is performed by fewer or greater number of individuals; 4) shift work of an individual is plastic and may change with age; 5) foraging and fanning shifts are coupled yet dissociable. This study adds to the findings that shift work is not exclusive to modern human societies and that a natural form of shift work exists in honeybees. These results suggest that shift work in honeybees is a feature of worker division of labor. Future studies aiming to further understand the structure, function and mechanism of this natural form of shift work in honey bees not only could have an impact on agriculture but also may provide insight into alternative forms of shift work strategies that may reduce the various health problems associated with shift work in humans.",671,82,334,31.0

How insects cope with the consequences of wing damage is therefore a central question when studying how robust flight performance is possible with such fragile chitinous wings. It has been shown in a variety of insect species that the loss in lift-force production resulting from wing damage is generally compensated by an increase in wing beat frequency rather than amplitude. The consequences of wing damage for flight performance, however, are less well understood, and vary considerably between species and behavioural tasks. One hypothesis reconciling the varying results is that wing damage might affect fast flight manoeuvres with high acceleration, but not slower ones. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of wing damage on the manoeuvrability of hummingbird hawkmoths (Macroglossum stellatarum) tracking a motorised flower. This assay allowed us to sample a range of movements at different temporal frequencies, and thus assess whether wing damage affected faster or slower flight manoeuvres. We show that hummingbird hawkmoths compensate for the loss in lift force mainly by increasing wing beat amplitude, yet with a significant contribution of wing beat frequency. We did not observe any effects of wing damage on flight manoeuvrability at either high or low temporal frequencies.",671,113,214,21.0

For example, young nurses take care of the brood constantly throughout the day and lack circadian rhythms, while foragers use the circadian clock to remember and predict food availability in subsequent days. Previous studies suggested that development of circadian rhythms both in the field and the laboratory began around 7-9 days of age. However, not much is understood about the postembryonic development of circadian rhythms in honey bees. In the current study, we examine the effects of socially regulated colony temperature on the ontogeny of circadian rhythms of young workers under controlled laboratory conditions. We hypothesized that temperature plays a key role in the development of circadian rhythmicity in young workers. Our results show that young workers kept at 35°C develop circadian rhythmicity faster and in greater proportion than bees kept at 25°C. In addition, we examine if the effect of colony temperature during the first 48 hours after emergence is enough to observe effects on the rate and proportion of development of circadian rhythmicity. We observed that twice as many individuals that were exposed to 35°C during the first 48 hours develop circadian rhythms compared to individuals kept at 25°C. In addition, we observed differences in the average endogenous period length consistent with temperature compensation of the circadian rhythms between the 25°C and 35°C cohorts. We also observed differences in the degree of period length variation between the 25°C and 35°C cohorts, which combined with the proportion of arrhythmic individuals and survival data suggest that development of circadian rhythms is incomplete in individuals exposed to 25°C adult emergence. This study shows that temperature, which is socially regulated inside the hive, is a key factor that influences the ontogeny of circadian rhythmicity of workers.",670,115,182,28.0

Telenomus podisi parasitizes eggs of the exotic stink bug Halyomorpha halys at the same rate as eggs of its coevolved host, Podisus maculiventris, but the parasitoid cannot complete its development in the exotic species. We hypothesized that T. podisi learns to exploit cues from this non-coevolved species, thereby increasing unsuccessful parasitism rates. We conducted bioassays to compare the responses of naïve vs. experienced parasitoids on chemical footprints left by one of the two host species. Both naïve and experienced females showed a higher response to footprints of P. maculiventris than of H. halys. Furthermore, parasitoids that gained an experience on H. halys significantly increased their residence time within the arena and the frequency of re-encounter with the area contaminated by chemical cues.

We used a null model approach to test the prediction that there are differences between observed and expected signal overlap in both communities. As predicted under ANH, we found much lower overlap of acoustic signals than expected by chance. In addition, spectral and temporal overlap between different signals was far more common in Hawaii than Costa Rica.

While social behaviors are likely critical for survival, surprisingly little is known about how they evolve in response to changing environmental pressures. With its highly social surface form and multiple populations of a largely asocial, blind, cave-dwelling form, the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, provides a powerful model to study the evolution of social behavior. Given numerous morphological and behavioral differences between the surface and cave forms, a primary impediment to understanding how this behavior evolved is a lack of computational and statistical approaches that can precisely identify independent aspects of social behavior. Here, we use motion tracking and kinematic analysis to quantify social swimming patterns and argue that the absence of schooling in cavefish is not merely a consequence of their inability to see but rather a genuine behavioral adaptation that impacts the way they explore their cave environment. Surface fish school, maintaining both close proximity and alignment with each other. In the dark, surface fish no longer school, but we show that they still attempt to align and maintain proximity when they find themselves near another fish. Conversely, cavefish exhibit little preference for proximity or alignment, instead actively avoiding each other. Cavefish also slow down when more fish are present in the tank, which neither surface fish in the light or in the dark do. Using data-driven computer simulations, we show that those two traits – active avoidance and collective slowdown – are sufficient to shift the exploration strategy of cavefish from mostly-following-the-walls to exploring-the-entire-tank. Finally, we find that those differences in collective swimming patterns are largely consistent across independently-evolved cave populations, revealing an evolutionary convergence on this emergent social behavior.Author Summary The Mexican tetra fish offers a fascinating window into the evolution of schooling behavior. Its ancestral-like surface form is found in the rivers and lakes of Mexico and Texas and is highly social. Over the last million years, A. mexicanus repeatedly evolved a second, largely asocial cave form after colonizing a series of dark, underground caves. Here we use motion tracking technology to compare the collective displacement patterns of four populations and present evidence that the loss of schooling in cave populations (i) is a genuine example of parallel behavioral evolution rather than a mere consequence of not being able to see in the dark and (ii) could constitute a cave-specific exploration strategy.",1394,205,464,31.0

These two debilitating effects are common in neuropsychiatric conditions but modelling them preclinically to date is slow as it requires prolonged operant training. A step change would be the validation of functionally equivalent but fast, simple, high-throughput tasks based on spontaneous behaviour. Here, we show that spontaneous object preference testing meets these requirements in the subchronic phencyclidine (scPCP) rat model for cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. scPCP rats show clear memory sensitivity to distraction in the standard novel object recognition task (stNOR). However, due to this, stNOR cannot assess proactive interference. Therefore, we compared scPCP performance in stNOR to that using the continuous NOR task (conNOR), which offers minimal distraction, allowing disease-relevant memory deficits to be assessed directly. We first determined that scPCP treatment did not affect whisker movements during object exploration. scPCP rats exhibited the expected distraction stNOR effect but had intact performance on the first conNOR trial, effectively dissociating distraction by using two NOR task variants. In remaining conNOR trials, scPCP rats performed above chance throughout but, importantly, their detection of object novelty was increasingly impaired relative to controls. We attribute this effect to the accumulation of proactive interference. This is the first demonstration that increased sensitivity to distraction and proactive interference, both key cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, can be dissociated in the scPCP rat using two variants of the same fast, simple, spontaneous object memory paradigm.",708,183,198,21.0

Here, we investigate genetic differences as a possible source of variation and variability in Drosophila grooming. Drosophila grooming behavior confers survival and social benefits. Although the leg movements that constitute the grooming sequence are stereotyped, their order is not fixed. Grooming features of five drosophilid species exposed to a dust irritant were analyzed. Components of grooming behavior were conserved between and within species. However, significant differences in grooming syntax were identified, corresponding both to anterior and posterior grooming actions. Genetic heterogeneity was not found to be related to grooming variability, as melanogaster flies bred to increase genetic het-erogeneity did not exhibit increased variability in grooming syntax. Likewise, no relationship between decreased heterogeneity and variability was identified. Finally, individual melanogaster flies were observed on consecutive days to determine the degree of variability of grooming behavior within an individual over time. Individual flies were not found to possess strong, stable grooming traits over several recordings. Additionally, standardization of sensory input using optogenetics did not eliminate grooming variability. In aggregate, these data suggest the importance of sensory inputs and other factors such as life history in grooming variability.Significance Statement Broadly speaking, genes influence behavior, but genes also play a role in determining the natural range of behavioral variability. Here, we show that Drosophila species exhibit differences in grooming behavior both between and within species. In particular, we demonstrate that transitions between grooming actions differ significantly between drosophilid species and common melanogaster stock lines, suggesting that these actions are under partial genetic control. Within melanogaster, however, genotype had no observable effect on the range of grooming behavior. This work establishes similarities in grooming behavior between drosophilids while also highlighting important differences, providing targets for future explorations of genetic, sensory, and developmental contributions to behavior.",1238,207,397,12.0

However, how such memories and heading representations interact to produce powerful navigational behaviours remains unclear 7,13,14. Here we combine behavioural experiments with computational modelling that is strictly based on connectomic data to provide a new perspective on how navigation might be orchestrated in these insects. Our results reveal a lateralised design, where signals about whether to turn left or right are segregated in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Furthermore, we show that guidance is a two-stage process: the recognition of visual memories – presumably in the MBs – does not directly drive the motor command, but instead updates a “desired heading” – presumably in the CX – which in turn is used to control guidance using celestial compass information. Overall, this circuit enables ants to recognise views independently of their body orientation, and combines terrestrial and celestial cues in a way that produces exceptionally robust navigation.",731,110,289,28.0

Rats received post-training bilateral infusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol into either the aIC or pIC and were tested 48 and 72 hours after the conditioning session to assess contextual (CFC) and tone (TFC) fear conditioning, respectively. Inactivation of the aIC during memory consolidation did not affect fear memory for CFC or TFC. On the other hand, post-training inactivation of the pIC impaired TFC but not CFC.

Previous studies have examined how varying environments can elicit unpredictable movement, but the intrinsic causes of complex, unpredictable behavior are not yet known. We addressed this question by analyzing &gt;200 hours of flight performed by hummingbirds, a group of aerial specialists noted for their extreme agility and escape performance. We used information theory to calculate unpredictability based on the positional entropy of short flight sequences during 30-min and 2-hour trials. We show that a bird’s entropy is repeatable, with stable differences among individuals that are negatively correlated with wing loading: birds with lower wing loading are less predictable. Unpredictability is also positively correlated with a bird’s overall acceleration and rotational performance, and yet we find that moment-to-moment changes in acceleration and rotational velocities do not directly influence entropy. This indicates that biomechanical performance must share an underlying basis with a bird’s ability to combine maneuvers into unpredictable sequences. Contrary to expectations, hummingbirds achieve their highest entropy at relatively slow speeds, pointing to a fundamental trade-off whereby individuals must choose to be either fast or unpredictable.",702,110,162,26.0

Herbivores use these metabolites as behavioral cues to increase their fitness. However, how herbivores integrate different metabolite classes into fitness-relevant foraging decisions in planta is poorly understood. We developed a molecular manipulative approach to modulate the availability of sugars and benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites as foraging cues for a specialist maize herbivore, the western corn rootworm. By disrupting sugar perception in the western corn rootworm and benzoxazinoid production in maize, we show that sugars and benzoxazinoids act as distinct and dynamically integrated mediators of short-distance host finding and acceptance. While sugars improve the capacity of rootworm larvae to find a host plant and to distinguish post-embryonic from less nutritious embryonic roots, benzoxazinoids are specifically required for the latter. Host acceptance in the form of root damage is increased by benzoxazinoids and sugars in an additive manner. This pattern is driven by increasing damage to post-embryonic roots in the presence of benzoxazinoids and sugars. Benzoxazinoid- and sugar-mediated foraging directly improves western corn rootworm growth and survival. Interestingly, western corn rootworm larvae retain a substantial fraction of their capacity to feed and survive on maize plants even when both classes of chemical cues are almost completely absent. This study unravels fine-grained differentiation and integration of primary and secondary metabolites into herbivore foraging and documents how the capacity to compensate for the lack of important chemical cues enables a specialist herbivore to survive within unpredictable metabolic landscapes.",2065,334,737,45.0

One way to localize is to recognize the state with which incoming sensory observations have been previously associated. Another is to update a previous state estimate given a known transition. In practice, both strategies are subject to uncertainty and must be balanced with respect to their relative confidences; robust learning requires aligning the predictions of both models over historic observations. Here, we propose a dual-systems account of the hippocampal-entorhinal system, where sensory prediction errors between these models during online exploration of state space initiate offline probabilistic inference. Offline inference computes a metric embedding on grid cells of an associative place graph encoded in the recurrent connections between place cells, achieved by message passing between cells representing non-local states. We provide testable explanations for coordinated place and grid cell ‘replay’ as efficient message passing, and for distortions, partial rescaling and direction-dependent offsets in grid patterns as the confidence weighted balancing of model priors, and distortions to grid patterns as reflecting inhomogeneous sensory inputs across states.Author SummaryMinimising prediction errors between transition and sensory input (observation) models predicts partial rescaling and direction-dependent offsets in grid cell firing patterns.Inhomogeneous sensory inputs predict distortions of grid firing patterns during online localisation, and local changes of grid scale during offline inference.Principled information propagation during offline inference predicts coordinated place and grid cell ‘replay’, where sequences propagate between structurally related features.",2752,149,1006,51.0

Although the underlying interaction has been considered to obey the distance-dependent law, resembling physical particle systems, recent findings emphasized that pedestrian motions are fundamentally influenced by the anticipated future positions of their neighbors rather than their current positions. Therefore, anticipatory interaction may play a crucial role in collective patterning. However, whether and how individual anticipation functionally benefits the group is not well-understood. We suggest that collective patterning in human crowds is promoted by anticipatory path-seeking behavior resulting in a scale-free movement pattern, called the Lévy walk. In our experiments of lane formation, a striking example of self-organized patterning in human crowds where people moving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into several unidirectional lanes, we manipulated some pedestrians’ ability to anticipate by having them type on a mobile phone while walking. The manipulation slowed overall walking speeds and delayed the onset of global patterning, and the distracted pedestrians sometimes failed to achieve their usual walking strategy. Moreover, we observed that the delay of global patterning depends on decisions made by pedestrians who were moving toward the distracted ones and had no choice but to take sudden large steps, presumably because of difficulty in anticipating the motions of their counterparts. These results imply that mutual anticipation between pedestrians facilitates efficient transition to emergent patterning in situations where nobody within a crowd is distracted. Our findings may contribute to efficient crowd management and inform future models of self-organizing systems.",702,146,168,21.0

As colour discrimination is almost impossible to test directly in animals, it is important to develop theoretical models based in the properties of visual systems. One of the most successful is the receptor noise-limited (RNL) model, which depends only on the level of noise in photoreceptors and opponent mechanisms. Here optimal colour discrimination properties are obtained using information theoretical tools, for the early stages of visual systems with and without colour opponent mechanisms. For most biologically relevant conditions the optimal discrimination function of an ideal observer coincides with the one obtained with the RNL model. Many variants of the model can be cast into the same framework, which permits meaningful comparisons across species. For example, it is shown that the presence of opponency seems to be the preferred hypothesis for bees, but not for budgerigars.

Higginson,2020.08.06.239616;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.06.239616,"Anthropogenic influences on habitats often affect predation on species by introducing novel predators, supporting additional predators, or reducing animals’ ability to detect or avoid predators. Other changes may reduce the ability of animals to feed, or alter their energy use. An increase in predation risk is assumed to reduce prey populations by increasing mortality, reducing foraging and growth. Often animals don’t appear to have been adversely affected, or may even increase growth rate. However, theoretical predictions that may have been overlooked suggest that optimal foraging rate, mortality rate and growth rate may change in counter-intuitive ways, depending on exactly how predation risk or costs have been increased. Increasing predator density may increase mortality rate when foraging, reduce the safety of refuges, or alter the relationship between vigilance and attack likelihood. Increasing temperature may increase metabolic costs in ectotherms and reduce thermogenesis costs in endotherms, which affects the costs of active foraging and inactivity differently. Here, I review the theory on how predation risk and metabolic costs should affect foraging behaviour, mortality and growth in order to explain the great variation in behavioural responses. I show that in some situations animals may not respond behaviourally even though a change severely affects survival, and the mortality may be a poor metric of the impact of a change on population viability. In other situations a fitness proxy may change dramatically whilst fitness is unaffected due to compensatory changes in behaviour or life history. Other measures may change in a positive way whilst fitness declines. I describe how to identify the situations in the field and thereby make reliable measure of fitness in particular study systems.

The FAMACHA scoring system has been used successfully to detect levels of anaemia caused by infection with the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus in small ruminants and is an effective way to identify individuals in need of treatment. However, assessing FAMACHA is labour-intensive and costly as individuals must be manually examined at frequent intervals over the Haemonchus season. Here, we show that accelerometers can measure individual activity in extensively grazing small ruminants subject to natural Haemonchus contortus worm infection in southern Africa over long time-scales, and when combined with machine learning, can predict the smallest pre-clinical increases in FAMACHA score as well as those individuals that respond to treatment, all with high precision (&gt;95%). We demonstrate that these classifiers remain robust over time, and remarkably, generalise without retraining across goats and sheep in different regions and types of farming enterprise. Interpretation of the trained classifiers reveal that as the effect of haemonchosis increases, both sheep and goats exhibit a similar reduction in the fine-grained variation of their activity levels. Our study thus reveals common behavioural patterns across small ruminant species, which low-cost biologgers can exploit to detect subtle changes in animal health and enable timely and targeted intervention. This has real potential to improve economic outcomes and animal welfare as well as limit the use of anthelmintic drugs and hence diminish pressures on anthelmintic resistance under conditions of both commercial and resource-poor communal farming.Significance Statement Increasing availability make biologgers and machine learning viable solutions to current challenges in global livestock farming. We demonstrate a pipeline that accurately predicts the earliest signs of parasitic disease in small ruminants. With Haemonchus contortus nematode infection in sheep and goats as the exemplar, we illustrate that the predictive model generalises across time and even species without retraining. We show that prediction is driven by a reduction in the variation of activity levels in animals with poor health. Our findings suggest that health of individual livestock can be monitored remotely, reducing labour costs, improving animal welfare, and allowing for targeted selective treatment under contrasting farming conditions.

Characterizing the multivariate structure of such traits is fundamental to understand their evolution. In bird species that form stable pair bonds and are territorial year-round, both sexes are expected to defend their territory; however, the role that each sex plays in defending their shared territory remains largely unknown. Evidence for the sex-roles during territorial defence is mixed and sex- and context-specific characterizations of territorial defence embracing the multivariate nature of the trait are currently lacking. Here we investigated sex- and context-specific variation in a hypothesised latent variable called “territorial defence” and tested whether duets were part of territorial defence in a wild population of rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus). To do so, we combined a simulated territorial intrusion approach during nest building and provisioning contexts with a structural equation modelling approach. Our results showed that, in males and females, the six measured behavioural variables were linked by a single latent trait, territorial defence, in both contexts. Flights over the decoy and duet songs were equally good proxies of territorial defence. Although males were defending more the territory than females, pair members showed a positive correlation in their behaviour. The structural equation modelling framework enabled us to capture a complex correlation pattern among behavioural variables, expanding upon a classic body of research on territorial defence. Thus, the combination of classical behavioural approaches with sophisticated statistical analyses brings new exciting possibilities to the field of behavioural ecology.Significance statement Territorial defence is a key behaviour in territorial species as it plays a major role in an individual’s reproductive success and survival. Additionally, territorial defence has been proposed as one possible evolutionary driver of duetting behaviour, one of the most fascinating vocal behaviours in birds. As behaviours are evolutionary characters, they must be studied in a multivariate framework. In this study we focused on characterizing territorial defence during a simulated territorial intrusion in an integrative manner using a classical territorial intrusion framework. We did so in male and female rufous horneros (Aves: Furnaridae) across two breeding contexts, while simultaneously testing theoretical predictions about the role of duetting behaviour as key part of territorial defence.

Using the delayed matching to sample VWM task in rhesus macaques (N=6), we aimed to characterize VWM maintenance in terms of performance changes as a function of delay duration (across a wide range of delays from 1 to 76 s). Then, we studied how cholinergic neuromodulation influences VWM maintenance using the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine administered alone as transient amnestic treatment, and in combination with two doses of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, a widely used Alzheimer’s medication probing for the reversal of scopolamine-induced impairments. Results indicate that scopolamine-induced impairments of VWM maintenance are delay-dependent and specifically affect the 15-33 s time range, suggesting that scopolamine worsens the normal decay of VWM with the passage of time. Donepezil partially rescued the observed scopolamine-induced impairments of VWM performance. These results provide strong behavioral evidence for the role of increased cholinergic tone and muscarinic neuromodulation in the maintenance of VWM beyond a few seconds, in line with our current knowledge on the role of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in sustained neural activity during VWM delay periods.",985,127,195,37.0

However, by understanding the relative honesty of a signal as a statistical property of an individual or population, researchers have recently quantitively describe dishonest communication. Thus, dishonesty signals can be understood as when there is a breakdown in the correlation between a signal and its underlying meaning; creating variation within a signaling system. However, such variation in signaling systems may not be attributed to dishonesty, because of inherent noise within biological systems driven by evolutionary or physiological noise. Here, we try to separate out functional variation within honest or dishonesty signaling systems from inherent biological noise by leveraging homologous structures that have evolved for separate functions – the enlarged claws of freshwater crayfish. Because burrowing species of freshwater crayfish claws have not evolved as signals, the variability in the size and strength of their claws should be minimal when compared to claws of non-burrowing species that evolved as signals during aggression. We found that despite the claws of burrowing and nonburrowing crayfish claws having evolved to serve difference functions, the claws of all species in our study were inherently noisy. Furthermore, although claws that unreliably correlate to the strengthen the wielder may function as dishonest signals in other crustaceans, we did not find support for this hypothesis; because crayfish escalated aggression based on relative body size.",552,64,142,32.0

This suggestion led to the development of a new theoretical framework for associative learning relying on prediction error rather than just temporal contiguity between events. However, many recent studies have failed to replicate the blocking effect, questioning the central role of blocking in associative learning theory. Here, we test the expression of Kamin blocking in rats that either approach and interact with the conditioned cue (sign trackers) or approach and interact with the reward location (goal trackers) during appetitive classical conditioning. The behavioral task involved three phases: classical conditioning of a lever cue, conditioning of a compound of the lever cue plus an auditory cue, and testing response to presentation of the auditory cue in extinction. The results show that only sign trackers express the blocking effect. Thus, groups that include goal trackers are less likely to be able to replicate the blocking effect. Our findings support the idea that sign and goal tracking responses arise as a result of distinct parallel learning processes. Psychological theories of learning that incorporate these parallel learning processes and their interactions will provide a better framework for understanding the blocking effect and related associative learning phenomena.",696,139,149,31.0

In order to study long-term synaptic changes associated with RM or WM, we trained chronically implanted rats in three different radial maze tasks: a classical RM task and two WM tasks involving different levels of proactive interference. Synaptic responses at the perforant path to dentate gyrus synapse were recorded on a long-time scale (24h) in freely-moving rats after training in one of these three tasks. We found that consolidation of long-term information leads to a delayed synaptic potentiation, occurring 9 hours after RM training and predicting good behavioral performance on the following day. In contrast, optimal information processing into WM triggers a synaptic depression immediately observed after training and lasting 3 hours, that could act as a mechanism for interference erasure/forgetting.",546,82,138,28.0

Faces carry both temporal (low-level physical correspondence of mouth movement and auditory speech) and linguistic (learned physical correspondences of mouth shape (viseme) and speech sound (phoneme)) cues. Listeners participated in two experiments investigating how these cues may be used to process sentences when maskers are present. In Experiment I, faces were rotated to disrupt linguistic but not temporal cue correspondence. Listeners suffered a deficit in speech comprehension when the faces were rotated, indicating that visemes are processed in a rotation-dependent manner, and that linguistic cues aid comprehension. In Experiment II, listeners were asked to detect pitch modulation in the target speech with upright and inverted faces that either matched the target or masker speech such that performance differences could be explained by binding, an early multisensory integration mechanism distinct from traditional late integration. Performance in this task replicated previous findings that temporal integration induces binding, but there was no behavioral evidence for a role of linguistic cues in binding. Together these experiments point to temporal cues providing a speech processing benefit through binding and linguistic cues providing a benefit through late integration.",812,88,162,25.0

Hechavarría",604603;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/604603,"Animals extract behaviorally relevant signals from “noisy” environments. To investigate signal extraction, echolocating provides a rich system testbed. For orientation, bats broadcast calls and assign each echo to the corresponding call. When orienting in acoustically enriched environments or when approaching targets, bats change their spectro-temporal call design. Thus, to assess call adjustments that are exclusively meant to facilitate signal extraction in “noisy” environments, it is necessary to control for distance-dependent call changes. By swinging bats in a pendulum, we tested the influence of acoustic playback on the echolocation behavior of Carollia perspicillata. This paradigm evokes reproducible orientation behavior and allows a precise definition of the influence of the acoustic context. Our results show that bats dynamically switch between different adaptations to cope with sound-based navigation in acoustically contaminated environments. These dynamics of echolocation behavior may explain the large variety of adaptations that have been reported in the bat literature.Summary statement The frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata dynamically switch between different adaptations when echolocating in acoustically contaminated environments.",1432,392,568,32.0

Our results demonstrate the key role of movement unpredictability in successful strategies for both predators and prey, supporting the ‘shell-game’ hypothesis.

This is particularly striking in reinforcement learning (RL) situations when options are extrapolated from their original context. Range adaptation can be seen as the result of an adaptive coding process aiming at increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. However, this hypothesis leads to a counter-intuitive prediction: decreasing outcome uncertainty should increase range adaptation and, consequently, extrapolation errors. Here, we tested the paradoxical relation between range adaptation and performance in a large sample of subjects performing variants of a RL task, where we manipulated task difficulty. Results confirmed that range adaptation induces systematic extrapolation errors and is stronger when decreasing outcome uncertainty. Finally, we propose a range-adapting model and show that it is able to parsimoniously capture all the observed results.",1019,83,300,21.0

One strategy under consideration is to combine MOR agonists with kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists.Objectives The effects of KOR-agonists (U50488, nalfurafine) on fentanyl-versus-food choice were compared under conditions where the KOR agonists were added to the self-administered fentanyl (contingent delivery) or administered as pretreatments (non-contingent delivery) in male and female rats. The effects of increasing and decreasing the magnitude of the alternative food reinforcer were also determined.Methods Rats were trained to respond under a concurrent schedule of fentanyl (0, 0.32-10 μg/kg/infusion) and food reinforcement. In Experiment 1, U50488 and nalfurafine were co-administered with fentanyl as fixed-proportion mixtures (contingent administration). In Experiment 2, U50488 (1-10 mg/kg) and nalfurafine (3.2-32 μg/kg) were administered as acute pretreatments (non-contingent administration). nor-BNI (32 mg/kg) was administered prior to contingent and non-contingent KOR-agonist treatment in Experiment 3. Experiment 4 evaluated the effects of increasing and decreasing the magnitude of the non-drug reinforcer.Results Both U50488 and nalfurafine decreased fentanyl choice when administered contingently, demonstrating that KOR agonists punish opioid choice. Non-contingent U50488 and nalfurafine administration decreased rates of fentanyl and food self-administration without altering fentanyl choice. Both contingent and non-contingent U50488 and nalfurafine effects on fentanyl choice were attenuated by nor-BNI. Fentanyl choice was sensitive to increases and decreases in the magnitude of the non-drug reinforcer.Conclusions These results demonstrate that the effects of KOR agonists on fentanyl reinforcement are dependent upon the contingencies under which they are administered.",574,124,142,31.0

Each spider/wasp trial was filmed for 40 minutes under controlled conditions and three behavioral responses (detect, attack, avoid) were recorded in each of 136 trials, never using the same predator and prey more than once. In order to better understand the results obtained, two additional studies were performed. First, the reflection spectrum of the cuticle of the wasp and a theoretical visual sensibility model of the spider were used to calculate a parameter we called “absorption contrast” that allowed us to compare the perception contrast between black and orange in each wasp genus as viewed by the spider. Second, acute toxicity trials with the water flea, Daphnia magna, were performed to determine toxicity differences between BOB and non-BOB wasps.

This regulates food intake, maintains homeostasis and prevents disease. In C. elegans, chemosensory neurons sense food and relay information to the rest of the animal via hormones to control food-related behaviour and physiology. Here we identify a new component of this system, SKN-1B which acts as a central food-responsive node, ultimately controlling satiety and metabolic homeostasis. SKN-1B, an ortholog of mammalian NF-E2 related transcription factors (Nrfs), has previously been implicated with metabolism and respiration, because can mediate the increased lifespan incurred by dietary restriction. We show that actually SKN-1B is not essential for dietary restriction longevity and instead, controls a variety of food-related behaviours. It acts in two hypothalamus-like ASI neurons to sense food, communicate nutritional status to the organism, and control satiety and exploratory behaviours.

We then present a mathematical model, based on inferred functional interactions between fish, which accurately describes individual and group foraging of real fish. We show that these interactions allow fish to combine individual and social information to achieve near-optimal foraging efficiency and promote income equality within groups. We further show that the interactions that would maximize efficiency in these social foraging models depend on group size, but not on food distribution - suggesting that fish may adaptively pick the subgroup of neighbors they “listen to” to determine their own behavior.Impact statement Analysis and modeling of group behavior of adult zebrafish shows that a specialized social interaction mechanism increases foraging efficiency and equality within groups, under a variety of environmental conditions.",1610,203,448,46.0

A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables with two-tailed at α=0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8% and 24.3% respectively.

The spread of invasive species is also facilitated by human activity, further increasing the pressure on native species. In two experiments we measured the foraging efficiency, risk perception and inter-individual consistency of risk-taking (personality variation in boldness) of an invasive species, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and a threatened tilapia, the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), in clear and turbid water. In experiment one, O. niloticus was faster to initiate feeding, encountered more food items, and consumed more than O. amphimelas. The latency to start foraging by O. niloticus decreased in turbid water. Turbidity did not affect the latency to start foraging in O. amphimelas but the number of food items they encountered was highest at the intermediate turbidity. There was however no significant effect of turbidity in either species on the total food consumed. In contrast to this foraging context, in experiment two with a refuge and no food available, risk taking behaviour was similar in both species and they both responded with similarly reduced risk taking in turbid water. Evidence of personality variation was weak, being observed only in O. amphimelas when first leaving the shelter in turbid water. Overall, species differences were greater in the foraging context but turbidity was more important in the risk-taking context. O. amphimelas is more sensitive to turbidity during foraging, and O. niloticus is likely to have a competitive advantage in foraging situations, especially in degraded turbid habitats.Significance Statement Under human-induced environmental change, native species are often exposed to multiple stressors. Here we tested the responses of two cichlid fish to increasing turbidity. The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), which is invasive throughout the tropics, and the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), a threatened species, indigenous to Tanzania. We found that turbidity was beneficial to the foraging of O. niloticus, which in both clear and turbid water consumed and encountered more food than O. amphimelas. In contrast, without food present, both species displayed similar responses of increased risk perception in turbid water with little evidence of personality variation between individuals in either species.

The intensity of heroin seeking is negatively modulated by cue-induced increases in synaptic proximity of astrocytes. Glutamate-driven heroin seeking is also negatively regulated by compounds that promote glutamate uptake through the astrocytic transporter GLT-1. We hypothesized that the cue-induced increase in astrocyte synaptic proximity reduces heroin seeking by increasing GLT-1 synaptic proximity.METHODS Rats were trained to self-administer heroin or sucrose before undergoing extinction and cued reinstatement of heroin or sucrose seeking. We used confocal microscopy to assess expression and co-registration of GLT-1 with the synaptic marker Synapsin I in the nucleus accumbens core.RESULTS Extinction from heroin, but not sucrose self-administration, downregulated GLT-1. Heroin cues increased surface expression of GLT-1 in parallel with heroin seeking, but counter to expectations, the increase was not proximal to synapses identified by Synapsin I. In fact, astroglia showing cue-induced increased surface expression of GLT-1 constituted a distinct subpopulation of astroglia from those showing increased synaptic proximity. Supporting discrete mechanisms, preventing cue-evoked increases in astrocyte synaptic proximity by knocking down the astroglial-selective actin binding protein ezrin did not impact cue-induced increases in GLT-1 surface expression.CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that heroin-paired cues elicit two transient adaptations in astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens core, restoration of synaptic proximity and increased surface expression of GLT-1. Each adaptation occurs in largely non-overlapping subpopulations of astrocytes, but both adaptations appear to dampen reinstated heroin seeking.",733,106,178,31.0

We continuously recorded undisturbed same-sex pairs of C57BL/6J males and females at 5 weeks and 3 and 7 months of age over three days. Males emitted only a few short USVs, mainly when isolated from their conspecific, whereas females emitted a high number of USVs, especially when engaged in intense dynamic social interactions. The context-specific use of call types and acoustic variations emerged with increasing age. The emission of USVs also reflected a high level of excitement in social interactions.

Feedbacks between an individual’s personality and state can strengthen (positive feedback) or weaken (negative feedback) individual differences when experiences such as predator encounters or winning contests are dependent on personality type. We examined the influence of foraging on individual-level consistency in refuge use (a measure of risk-taking, i.e. boldness) in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and particularly whether changes in refuge use depended on boldness measured under control conditions. In the control treatment trials with no food, individuals were repeatable in refuge use across repeated trials, and this behavioral consistency did not differ between the start and end of these trials. In contrast, when food was available, individuals showed a higher degree of consistency in refuge use at the start of the trials versus controls but this consistency significantly reduced by the end of the trials. The effect of the opportunity to forage was dependent on personality, with bolder fish varying more in their refuge use between the start and the end of the feeding trials than shyer fish. This suggests a state-behavior feedback, but there was no overall trend in how individuals changed their behavior, with some individuals spending more, and others less, time in the refuge area at the end than at the start of the trials.

Here I present a game-theory model of hierarchy formation in which individuals adjust their aggressive behaviour towards other group members through reinforcement learning. Individual traits such as the tendency to generalise learning between interactions with different individuals, the rate of learning, and the initial tendency to be aggressive are genetically determined and can be tuned by evolution. I find that evolution favours individuals with high social competence, making use of individual recognition, bystander learning and, to a limited extent, generalising learned behaviour between opponents when adjusting their behaviour towards other group members. The results are in good agreement with experimental data, for instance in finding weaker winner effects compared to loser effects.",850,76,231,39.0

In this research, our goal was to characterize these responses by performing resident-intruder assays, in which aggressive behaviors were measured in territorial males in response to the introduction of unfamiliar males that differed in relative standard length (SL). We found that the relative SL of intruders played an important role in determining behavioral performance. Resident males exposed to larger (&gt;5% larger in SL) or matched (between 0 and 5% larger or smaller in SL) intruder males performed more lateral displays, a type of non-physical aggression, compared to resident males exposed to smaller (&gt;5% smaller in SL) intruder males. However, physical aggression, such as chases and bites, did not differ as a function of relative SL. Our results suggest that A. burtoni males amplify non-physical aggression to settle territorial disputes in response to differences in relative SL that were not previously considered to be behaviorally relevant.HighlightsRelative size determines social rank in the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoniResident male A. burtoni respond differently to small size differences in intruder malesResidents perform more non-physical aggression against larger intrudersResidents do not alter physical aggression as a function of differently sized intrudersDistinct behavioral strategies are used against different intruders",750,188,185,21.0

Five Ts65Dn and one WT animals reached Stage 5 and only one Ts65Dn mouse reached VD. Ts1Cje mice took longer (17.86±3.19 days) to move to VD vs. WT (11.44±1.96 days, P=0.09). There were no differences between Dp(16)1/Yey and WT mice. At VD, the average percent of correct answers was significantly lower in Dp(16)1/Yey (22.70±1.93%) and Ts1Cje (34.39±1.98%) compared to WT littermates (32.18±1.49% and 41.11±1.45%, respectively, P&lt;0.05). In another set of experiments, we demonstrated that mild food restriction significantly reduced the time needed to complete pre-training in C57BL/6J mice compared to C67BL/6J mice that had ad libitum access to food and water. In conclusion, we were able to apply human cognitive tests to evaluate hippocampal learning and cortical inhibitory control in three mouse models of DS. These studies demonstrate significant cognitive differences between strains. Future experiments will evaluate whether food restriction and/or pre- and postnatal therapy decreases the time intervals to achieve training mile.",654,137,134,43.0

This trait probably arises from a trade-off between migration and reproduction and in females has been termed as the ‘oogenesis-flight syndrome’. However, the generality of this syndrome has been questioned, especially for monomorphic insects. We studied the relationship between migration and reproduction in the highly cosmopolitan painted lady butterfly, which in the Palaearctic undertakes the longest known multi-generational migration circuit of any insect. We tested for the oogenesis-flight syndrome in both spring and autumn migrants in two regions linked by migration, North Africa and northern Spain. Field observations were combined with laboratory experiments to determine the lifespan and the age at first mating to unravel the reproductive strategy observed in individuals captured in the wild. Females and males wait on average around 5–6 days before mating, and field data revealed that mating frequencies increase rapidly once females reach a medium wing wear category. There were seasonal differences in mating frequencies in the study regions depending on whether the region acted as a source or as a destination for migrants, and in the latter case there were almost twice as many mated females. Moreover, about 80% of females collected during migratory flights were unmated, the remaining females having mated only very recently. Our results thus strongly indicate that the painted lady fulfils the oogenesis-flight syndrome, as migration is concentrated in its relatively short pre-reproductive period. Field data also showed a high positive correlation between mating frequency and host plant abundance, which suggests that mated females have the ability to locate potential breeding areas. This, together with the very high fecundity estimated from over 1000 eggs in laboratory trials, makes the painted lady one of the most successful migratory insects on Earth.",1004,199,375,30.0

Many of them are NP-hard, that is, they are computationally intractable. Two important questions arise: which properties of decisions drive extreme computational hardness and what are the effects of these properties on human-decision making? Here, we postulate that we can study the effects of computational complexity on human decision-making by studying the mathematical properties of individual instances of NP-hard problems. We draw on prior work in computational complexity theory, which suggests that computational difficulty can be characterized based on the features of instances of a problem. This study is the first to apply this approach to human decision-making. We measured hardness, first, based on typical-case complexity (TCC), a measure of average complexity of a random ensemble of instances, and, second, based on instance complexity (IC), a measure that captures the hardness of a single instance of a problem, regardless of the ensemble it came from. We tested the relation between these measures and (i) decision quality as well as (ii) time expended in a decision, using two variants of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a canonical and ubiquitous computational problem. We show that participants expended more time on instances with higher complexity but that decision quality was lower in those instances.

As a result, the mechanistic causes of collision mortality are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate whether sensory and biomechanical traits can explain why some species are more collision-prone than others. We first examined concordance of species vulnerability estimates across previous North American studies to determine whether these estimates are repeatable, and whether vulnerability is more similar among closely-related species. We found moderate concordance and phylogenetic signal, indicating that some bird species are consistently more collision-prone than others. We next tested whether morphological traits related to flight performance and sensory guidance explain these differences among species. Our comparative analysis shows that two traits primarily predict collision vulnerability within passerines: relative beak length and relative wing length. Small passerine species with relatively short wings and those with relatively long beaks are more collision-prone, suggesting that greater maneuverability and obstructed vision contribute to risk. Together, these findings can help inform mitigation strategies and predict which species will be most at risk in other regions.",1087,115,271,26.0

However, little is known about the non-food-related water sources exploited by arboreal mammals, the seasonality of their drinking behavior and its potential drivers (including diet composition, temperature, and rainfall). We investigated this subject in 14 wild groups of brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) inhabiting small, medium, and large Atlantic Forest fragments in southern Brazil. We found a wide variation in the mean rate of drinking among groups (range=0-16 records/day). Streams (44% of 1,258 records) and treeholes (26%) were the major types of water sources, followed by bromeliads in the canopy (16%), pools (11%), and rivers (3%). The type of source influenced whether howlers used a hand to access the water or not. Drinking tended to be evenly distributed throughout the year, except for a slightly lower number of records in the spring than in the other seasons, but it was unevenly distributed during the day. It increased in the afternoon in all groups, particularly during temperature peaks around 15:00 and 17:00. We found via generalized linear mixed modelling that the daily frequency of drinking was mainly influenced by flower (negatively) and leaf (positively) consumption, whereas fruit consumption, fragment size, rainfall, and mean ambient temperature played negligible roles. The influence of leaf consumption is compatible with the ‘metabolite detoxification hypothesis,’ which states that the processing of this fibrous food requires the ingestion of larger volumes of water to help in the detoxification/excretion of its metabolites. In sum, we found that irrespective of habitat size and climatic conditions, brown howlers seem to seek a positive water balance by complementing preformed and metabolic water with drinking water, even when it is associated with a high predation risk in terrestrial sources.",839,75,169,29.0

Frank",653493;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/653493,"In computer science, reinforcement learning is a powerful framework with which artificial agents can learn to maximize their performance for any given Markov decision process (MDP). Advances over the last decade, in combination with deep neural networks, have enjoyed performance advantages over humans in many difficult task settings. However, such frameworks perform far less favorably when evaluated in their ability to generalize or transfer representations across different tasks. Existing algorithms that facilitate transfer typically are limited to cases in which the transition function or the optimal policy is portable to new contexts, but achieving “deep transfer” characteristic of human behavior has been elusive. Such transfer typically requires discovery of ions that permit analogical reuse of previously learned representations to superficially distinct tasks. Here, we demonstrate that ions that minimize error in predictions of reward outcomes generalize across tasks with different transition and reward functions. Such reward-predictive representations compress the state space of a task into a lower dimensional representation by combining states that are equivalent in terms of both the transition and reward functions. Because only state equivalences are considered, the resulting state representation is not tied to the transition and reward functions themselves and thus generalizes across tasks with different reward and transition functions. These results contrast with those using ions that myopically maximize reward in any given MDP and motivate further experiments in humans and animals to investigate if neural and cognitive systems involved in state representation perform ions that facilitate such equivalence relations.Author summary Humans are capable of transferring  knowledge from one task to another. For example, in a right-hand-drive country, a driver has to use the right arm to operate the shifter. A driver who learned how to drive in a right-hand-drive country can adapt to operating a left-hand-drive car and use the other arm for shifting instead of re-learning how to drive. Despite the fact that both tasks require different coordination of motor skills, both tasks are the same in an  sense: In both tasks, a car is operated and there is the same progression from 1st to 2nd gear and so on. We study distinct algorithms by which a reinforcement learning agent can discover state representations that encode knowledge about a particular task, and evaluate how well they can generalize. Through a sequence of simulation results, we show that state ions that minimize errors in prediction about future reward outcomes generalize across tasks, even those that superficially differ in both the goals (rewards) and the transitions from one state to the next. This work motivates biological studies to determine if distinct circuits are adapted to maximize reward vs. to discover useful state representations.",2914,453,1488,37.0

Here we study aerial predation of massive swarms of Brazilian free-tailed bats Tadarida brasiliensis by Swainson’s hawks Buteo swainsoni, testing how the behavioral strategies of predator and prey influence catch success and predation risk. The hawks achieved high overall catch success, but they were no more successful against lone bats than against bats flying in column formation. There was therefore no evidence of any net vigilance or confusion effect, and hawks attacking the column benefitted from the opportunity to make several attempted grabs. Even so, the bats’ overall risk of predation was an order of magnitude higher when flying alone. Attacks on lone bats (∼10% of attacks) were greatly overrepresented relative to the proportion of bats classified as flying alone (∼0.2%), so dilution is both necessary and sufficient to explain the higher survival rates of bats flying in the column. From the hawks’ perspective, their odds of catching a bat more than trebled if the attack involved a stoop rather than level flight, or a rolling rather than pitching grab maneuver. These behavioral tactics were independently deployed in nearly three-quarters of all attacks. Hence, whereas the survival rate of a bat depends principally on whether it flies alone or in a group, the catch success of a hawk depends principally on how it maneuvers to attack.Lay summary Bats emerging by daylight from a massive desert roost are able to minimise their predation risk by maintaining tight column formation, because the hawks that attack them target stragglers disproportionately often. Whereas the predation risk of a bat therefore depends on how it maintains its position within the swarm, the catch success of a hawk depends on how it maneuvers to attack. Catch success is maximised by executing a stooping dive or a rolling grab.",1442,754,507,20.0

We then fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the suites of behaviors exhibited by ancestral species, as well as the intra- and inter-species behavioral covariances. We found that much of intraspecific behavioral variation is explained by differences between individuals in the status of their behavioral hidden states, what might be called their “mood.” Lastly, we propose a method to identify groups of behaviors that appear to have evolved together, illustrating how sets of behaviors, rather than individual behaviors, likely evolved. Our approach provides a new framework for identifying co-evolving behaviors and may provide new opportunities to study the genetic basis of behavioral evolution.",2504,270,860,14.0

Pearson chi-square analysis revealed a significant variation of stereotypy in association with biological (age, sex, and rearing history) and captive (enclosure design) variables. Big cats’ stereotypic behaviors were found significantly influenced by the high visitor density. However, ambient noise did not impact the stereotypy of both the felid species.

The current study exposed male and female Long Evans rats to the synthetically produced predator odor 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) to examine individual differences in stress-reactive behaviors (digging and immobility) and whether these differences could predict lasting consequences of TMT and increases in alcohol drinking. Male and female Long Evans rats were trained on operant alcohol self-administration. After 9 sessions, rats underwent exposure to TMT or water (Control) in a distinct context. 6 days after TMT exposure, rats underwent re-exposure to the TMT-paired context (without TMT), and a series of behavioral assessments (acoustic startle, zero maze, light/dark box), after which rats resumed alcohol self-administration. Rats were divided into two TMT-subgroups using a ratio of digging and immobility behavior during TMT exposure: TMT-subgroup 1 (low digging/immobility ratio) and TMT-subgroup 2 (high digging/immobility ratio). Digging/immobility ratio scores predicted elevated corticosterone levels during TMT exposure and reactivity during context re-exposure in males and females (TMT-subgroup 2), as well as elevated corticosterone levels after context re-exposure and hyperarousal behavior in females (TMT-subgroup 1). Furthermore, TMT stress reactivity predicted increases in alcohol self-administration, specifically in females. These data show that stress-reactivity can predict lasting behavioral changes which may lead to a better understanding of increases in alcohol drinking following stress in females and that individual differences in stress-reactive behaviors using TMT may be helpful to understand resilience/susceptibility to the lasting consequences of stress.HighlightsExposure to the predator odor TMT produces distinct behavioral phenotypes in male and female ratsMale and female high stress reactive rats show enhanced reactivity to the TMT-paired contextStress-reactivity during TMT predicts increases in alcohol self-administration, in femalesStress-reactivity may help to understand resilience/susceptibility and impact on alcohol drinking",740,70,179,53.0

Consequently, the task of understanding these data to answer scientific questions increasingly requires the use of compression algorithms that reduce dimensionality by combining correlated features and cluster similar observations to summarize large datasets. Here we introduce a method for both dimension reduction and clustering called VAE-SNE (variational autoencoder stochastic neighbor embedding). Our model combines elements from deep learning, probabilistic inference, and manifold learning to produce interpretable compressed representations while also readily scaling to tens-of-millions of observations. Unlike existing methods, VAE-SNE simultaneously compresses high-dimensional data and automatically learns a distribution of clusters within the data — without the need to manually select the number of clusters. This naturally creates a multi-scale representation, which makes it straightforward to generate coarse-grained descriptions for large subsets of related observations and select specific regions of interest for further analysis. VAE-SNE can also quickly and easily embed new samples, detect outliers, and can be optimized with small batches of data, which makes it possible to compress datasets that are otherwise too large to fit into memory. We evaluate VAE-SNE as a general purpose method for dimensionality reduction by applying it to multiple real-world datasets and by comparing its performance with existing methods for dimensionality reduction. We find that VAE-SNE produces high-quality compressed representations with results that are on par with existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms. As a practical example, we demonstrate how the cluster distribution learned by VAE-SNE can be used for unsupervised action recognition to detect and classify repeated motifs of stereotyped behavior in high-dimensional timeseries data. Finally, we also introduce variants of VAE-SNE for embedding data in polar (spherical) coordinates and for embedding image data from raw pixels. VAE-SNE is a robust, feature-rich, and scalable method with broad applicability to a range of datasets in the life sciences and beyond.",7734,1337,4636,53.0

This learning may be important for speciation in some species. The butterfly Heliconius melpomene is a model system for several areas of research, including hybridization, mate selection, and speciation, partially due to its widespread diversity of wing patterns. It remains unclear whether these butterflies can learn to prefer certain mates and if social experience shapes realized mating preferences. Here we test whether previous experience with a female influences male mate preference for two different H. melpomene subspecies, H. m. malleti and H. m. rosina. We conducted no-choice behavioral assays to determine if latency to court and whether males courted (vs no courtship) differed between naïve males and males with previous exposure to a young, sexually mature, virgin female. To test whether assortative courtship preference is learned in H. melpomene, males were either paired with a female who shared their phenotype or one who did not. Naïve H. m. malletti males courted assortatively, while naïve H.m. rosina males did not. Experienced H. m. malleti males reduced their courting relative to naïve males, suggesting that social experience with a sexually mature female that does not result in copulation may be perceived as a negative experience. In contrast, experienced H. m. rosina males exhibited similar courting rates to naïve H. m. rosina males.

Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more , conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains. Yet both behavioral and model-based analyses suggest domain specific differences in how these representations map onto actions.Author summary There is a resurgence of interest in “cognitive maps” based on recent evidence that the hippocampal-entorhinal system encodes both spatial and non-spatial relational information, with far-reaching implications for human behavior. Yet little is known about the commonalities and differences in the computational principles underlying human learning and decision making in spatial and non-spatial domains. We use a within-subject design to examine how humans search for either spatially or conceptually correlated rewards. Using a Bayesian learning model, we find evidence for the same computational mechanisms of generalization across domains. While participants were sensitive to expected rewards and uncertainty in both tasks, how they leveraged this knowledge to guide exploration was different: participants displayed less uncertainty-directed and more random exploration in the conceptual domain. Moreover, experience with the spatial task improved conceptual performance, but not vice versa. These results provide important insights about the degree of overlap between spatial and conceptual cognition.",2741,318,1056,39.0

For example, during the social transmission of food preference (STFP), conspecific semiochemicals detected by mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the atypical olfactory receptor guanylyl cyclase D (GC-D+ OSNs) promote the acquisition of food preferences in the recipient animal, mitigating the risk of ingesting food contaminated with toxins or pathogens. However, it is unclear if GC-D+ OSNs mediate preference learning outside this specific context. Here, we report that GC-D+ OSNs are required for the acquisition of odor preferences by both adult and juvenile mice, and that GC-D-dependent preference could be formed for conditionally aversive odors. We used a two-choice olfactory behavioral test to assess odor preferences in adult Gucy2d +/+, +/- and -/- mice that encountered novel odors together with GC-D+ OSN stimuli (guanylin family peptides), during social investigation of a live conspecific, or during suckling as pups. Gucy2d +/+ and +/-mice (which express functional GC-D), but not Gucy2d -/- littermates, successfully acquire a preference for the demonstrated odor in any of these behavioral paradigms. Mice could even acquire a GC-D-dependent preference for odors to which they had recently formed a conditioned aversion. Together, these results demonstrate that GC-D+ OSNs mediate the acquisition of socially-transmitted odor preferences in different social and experiential contexts and at different life stages.",848,87,183,20.0

In order to better understand the factors associated with this situation to better tailor targeted control actions, it is critical to unravel environmental and geographical factors underlying the persistence of the disease in study hotspot villages. Hotspots villages were defined as those reporting more than six indigenous malaria cases during the previous year. A total of ten villages, including seven hotspots and three non-hotspots, were surveyed. All potential mosquito breeding sites identified in and around the tenth study villages were regularly monitored between 2013 and 2017. This monitoring concerned the presence of anophelines larvae and the collection of epidemiological, hydrogeological, topographical and biogeographical data. Throughout the study area, the number of larval breeding sites inventoried and monitored over the study period ranged from 50 to 62. They were higher, with no significant difference, in hotspot sites than in non-hotspot sites for each year of monitoring with 62.3% (56/62) in 2013, 90.9% (50/55) in 2014, 90.3% (56/62) in 2015 and 86% (43/50) in 2017 (Fisher’s exact test; p = 1). The Hotspot villages were mostly characterized by saline or moderately saline hydro-morphic and halomorphic soils allowing water retention and a suitable presence of potential larval breeding sites. Whereas non-hotspot villages are characterized mainly by a high proportion of extremely permeable sandy-textured soils due to their porosity, which reduces water retention. The annual number of confirmed malaria cases was corelated relatively with the frequency and extent of breeding sites. Malaria cases were much more higher in the hamlets located near to the breeding sites of An. gambiae s.l then gradually decreases with their remoteness. This study has shown that the dynamics of larval breeding sites by their longevity, stability, proximity to houses and their positiveness rate for the presence of Anopheles larvae could be a determining factor in the persistence of malaria hotspots in central western Senegal. The results of this study shed more light on the environmental factors underlying the residual transmission and should make it possible to better organize vector control interventions for malaria elimination in west-central Senegal.",728,54,130,22.0

Here, we consider possible explanations for these prospective caching behaviours and directly compare two competing hypotheses. The Compensatory Caching Hypothesis suggests that birds learn to cache more of a particular food in places where that food was less frequently available in the past. In contrast, the Future Planning Hypothesis suggests that birds recall what-when-where features of specific past events to predict the future availability of food. We designed a protocol in which the two hypotheses predict different caching patterns across different caching locations such that the two explanations can be disambiguated. We formalised the hypotheses in a Bayesian model comparison and tested this protocol in two experiments with one of the previously tested species, namely Eurasian jays. Consistently across the two experiments, the observed caching pattern did not support either hypothesis; rather it was best explained by a uniform distribution of caches over the different caching locations. Future research is needed to gain more insight into the cognitive mechanism underpinning corvids’ caching for the future.",591,54,167,19.0

Predictability is partially dependent on how consistent interaction patterns are over time: does the behaviour on one day explain the behaviour on another? We developed a consistency measure that serves two functions: detecting which interaction types in a data set are so inconsistent that including them in further analyses risks introducing unexplained error; and comparatively quantifying differences in consistency within and between animal groups. We applied the consistency measure to simulated data and field data for one group of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) and to groups of Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, to test its properties and compare consistency across groups. The consistency measures successfully identified interaction types whose low internal consistency would likely create analytical problems. Species-level differences in consistency were less pronounced than differences within groups: in all groups, aggression and dominance interactions were the most consistent, followed by grooming; spatial proximity at different levels was much less consistent than directed interactions. Our consistency measure can facilitate decision making of researchers wondering whether to include interaction types in their analyses or social networks and allows us to compare interaction types within and between species regarding their predictability.",935,90,223,28.0

Genetic factors have shown to play an important role in the development of aggression both in animals and humans, displaying moderate to high heritability estimates. However, although such types of conducts have been studied in different animal models, the molecular architecture of aggressiveness remains poorly understood. This study compared gene expression profiles of 16 prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples from aggressive and non-aggressive cattle breeds: Lidia, selected for agonistic responses, and Wagyu, specialized on meat production and selected for tameness. RNA sequencing was used to identify 918 up and 278 down-regulated differentiated expressed genes (DEG). The functional interpretation of the up-regulated genes in the aggressive cohort revealed enrichment of pathways such as the Alzheimer disease-presenilin, integrins or the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade, all implicated in the development of abnormal aggressive behaviors and neurophysiological disorders. Moreover, gonadotropins, leading to testosterone release, are also up-regulated as natural mechanisms enhancing aggression. Concomitantly, heterotrimeric G-protein pathways, associated with low reactivity mental states, and the GAD2 gene, a repressor of agonistic reactions at PFC, are down-regulated, guaranteeing the development of the adequate responses required by the aggressive Lidia cattle. We also identified six upstream regulators, whose functional activity fits with the etiology of abnormal behavioral responses associated with aggression. These results provide valuable insights into the complex architecture that underlie naturally developed agonistic behaviors.",964,79,188,28.0

Such fluctuations are rarely investigated in subjects’ daily living, partially due to the inaccessibility of sleep laboratory technology and cognitive testing. Here we leverage the continuous and long-term smartphone touchscreen interaction logs to study the patterns of cognitive output surrounding sleep and contrasted these to the patterns underlying physical activity captured from wrist-worn actigraphy. According to spectral density analysis, both cognitive and physical activity was dominated by diurnal (∼24 h) and infra-radian (∼7 days) rhythms. However, these rhythms differed in a domain-specific manner. The proxy measures of cognitive performance – tapping speed, unlocking speed, and app locating speed – contained lower-powered diurnal rhythm than physical activity. Still, the amount of smartphone usage showed the strongest diurnal rhythm – even when compared to the ambient luminescence levels experienced according to actigraphy. Interestingly, the cognitive rhythms were not in sync with physical activity, as cognitive measures peaked later in the day and on weekdays rather than weekends. The difference between cognitive and physical activity became vivid during bedtime and subjects routinely interacted with their smartphones during the actigraphy labelled sleep period. The cognitive measures in this period were worse in comparison to the hour before or after sleep. Therefore, smartphones can seamlessly capture the dynamic fluctuations in cognitive output including during spontaneous awakenings. We conclude that the rhythms underlying cognitive activity in the real world are distinct from physical activity and this discord may be a hallmark of modern human behaviour.",2104,226,576,30.0

Impact of the modification of the start chamber by providing substratum made up of cobbles and covering the water surface using water plant hydrilla, alone and in combinations on the boldness was also tested. Our results revealed that the apparatus has a significant impact on the boldness in climbing perch. The presence of a shelter in the experimental arena (swimway) and cobble substratum in the start chamber of the apparatus were found to be reducing boldness in this fish, while hydrilla cover on the water surface neutralised the impact of cobble substratum. Repeated exposure and resultant familiarity with the arena increased boldness of climbing perch but the pattern of modification of this behavioural trait exhibited during the course of experiment was divergent across the instruments. These results point towards the need for critically analyzing the influence of instruments used for measuring various behavioural traits and considering biological needs of the subject species while designing the apparatus.",955,80,173,28.0

Here we use echolocating bats, a trained discrimination task, and experimental noise playback to explicitly test perceptual mechanisms of noise disturbance. We demonstrate high individual variability in response to noise treatments and evidence for multiple perceptual mechanisms. Additionally, we highlight that only some individuals are able to cope with noise, while others are not. We tested for changes in echolocation call duration, amplitude, and peak frequency as possible ways of coping with noise. Although all bats strongly increased call amplitude and showed additional minor changes in call duration and frequency, these changes cannot explain the differences in coping and non-coping individuals.

In this study we examined the use of burrows by a common intertidal crab, Minuca pugnax, to control body temperature. To understand how body temperatures respond to changes in the surface temperature and explore how efficiently crabs exploit the cooling potential of burrows to thermoregulate, we measured body, surface, and burrow temperature data during low tide on Sapelo Island, GA in March, May, August, and September of 2019. We found that an increase in 1°C in the surface temperature led to a 0.70-0.71°C increase in body temperature for females and an increase in 0.75-0.77°C in body temperature for males. Body temperatures of small females were 0.3°C warmer than large females for the same surface temperature. Female crabs used burrows more efficiently for thermoregulation compared to the males. Specifically, an increase of 1°C in the cooling capacity (the difference between the burrow temperature and the surface temperature) led to an increase of 0.42-0.50°C for females and 0.34-0.35°C for males in the thermoregulation capacity (the difference between body temperature and surface temperature). The body temperature that crabs began to use burrows to thermoregulate was estimated to be around 24°C, which is far below the critical body temperatures that could lead to death. Many crabs experience body temperatures of 24°C early in the reproductive season, several months before the hottest days of the year. Because the use of burrows involves fitness trade-offs, these results suggest that warming temperatures could begin to impact crabs far earlier in the year than expected.",943,169,157,18.0

In this study, we developed an artificial sonar system based on the vertical sound localization characteristics of the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus). First, using the finite element method, we found that the beam of the first side lobe formed by a pinna constructed according to that in the brown long-eared bat shifted in an almost linear manner in the vertical direction as the frequency changed from 30 kHz to 60 kHz. We established a model of the relationship between the time-frequency features of the echo emitted by brown long-eared bats and the spatial direction by using the pre-trained neural network. We also developed a majority vote-based method called sliding window cumulative peak estimation (SWCPE) to optimize the outputs from the neural network. In addition, an L-shaped pinna structure was designed to simultaneously estimate the azimuth and elevation. Our field experiments indicated that the binaural conformation and relative binaural orientation both played vital roles in spatial target localization by these bats.

Living in large groups can reduce predation, but as group size increases, competition for resources also increases. The trade-off between the advantages of group living for an individual and competition caused by it can determine group dynamics, and this trade-off can vary with environmental conditions. Shoaling behaviour, the tendency of fish to form groups, is shown to be affected by factors such as resource availability, presence of predators and conspecifics. Although studies indicate that both predation and starvation pressure in an environment can determine whether fish choose to shoal or not, whether prolonged exposure to such conditions influences shoaling behaviour remains little explored. Here, we test how predation pressure and resource availability may interactively shape the shoaling behaviour of zebrafish (Danio rerio) when exposed to combinations of these pressures over a two-week period. We find that shoal size increases with predation and decreases with starvation, and that greater predation pressure increases shoaling tendencies even under reduced food availability. Overall, we show that prolonged exposure to varying predation pressure and resource availability can together influence shoaling tendencies of fish even when such pressures are relaxed.Significant statement In group living species, group structure and dynamics depend on various intrinsic factors and environmental stressors. Shoaling behaviour in fish, where individuals aggregate to form groups, is shown to be altered with environmental factors such as predation and resource availability. Although studies have examined the effects of these cues on shoaling behaviour, the ecological circumstances experienced by fish could also influence shoaling tendencies. We here show that shoaling behaviour is also shaped by previous experience of fish to predation and food resource availability. We check how shoaling behaviour varies with differences in predation pressure and resource availability after prolonged exposure to these conditions by measuring the shoal size and shoal cohesion in zebrafish. This study illuminates how shoaling tendencies of individuals shaped by the environmental conditions persist even when these environmental pressures are removed.",965,121,207,13.0

Many animals use cues left behind by predators, known as secondary predator cues (SPCs), to assess risk and respond appropriately. However, meerkats, Suricata suricatta, exhibit seemingly unique mobbing-like responses to these cues. The benefit of this high-intensity recruitment response is unclear, as unlike genuine mobbing, it cannot help to drive the predator away. One potential explanation is that mobbing-like responses promote information gathering and collective decision-making by the whole group. To examine this, we investigated (i) how meerkats’ responses to SPCs differ from mobbing live animals and (ii) the subsequent behavioural changes following a SPC encounter. Using a dataset gathered over a 20-year period, we first compared the rate of SPC recruitment versus the rate of animal mobbing. We then investigated changes in behaviour (alarm calling, sentinel bouts, distance travelled and pup provisioning) in the hour before and after a SPC encounter. Abiotic factors did not affect recruitment rate to SPCs or live animals, or influence the change in behavioural responses following a SPC encounter. The presence of pups reduced response rate to SPCs, but had no effect on animal mobbing rate, supporting experimental findings that responses towards SPCs are unlikely to function as a form of teaching. Alarm calling rate increased and the distance travelled by the group decreased following a SPC encounter, and were unaffected by the presence of pups or abiotic conditions. The results indicate group-level behavioural changes following a SPC encounter, and a greater degree of plasticity in recruitment to SPCs than to live animals. This response plasticity may reflect a context-dependent need to gather information to make collective decisions for defensive behaviour according to the level of threat perceived.",771,135,190,27.0

Learning to recognise and interpret predator cues is essential in the accurate assessment of risk. Cues can come directly from a predator’s presence (visual, acoustic) or from secondary predator cues (SPCs, such as hair/feathers, urine or faeces) left in the environment. Animals show various responses to encountering SPCs, which are thought to act in reducing risk to the individual. Meerkats, Suricata suricatta, show a response to SPCs not described in any other species: they display a mobbing-like behaviour. The function of this behaviour is unclear as unlike mobbing, the response it so closely resembles, it cannot serve to drive predators away. We used experiments to investigate whether adults may use this mobbing-like response to teach naïve young how to recognise and respond to predators. Meerkats are known to teach pups hunting skills, but there is as yet no evidence that any species other than humans teaches across multiple contexts. We used experimental presentations of SPCs to test whether wild adult meerkats respond more intensely to SPCs in the presence of naïve pups, as would be expected if the behaviour serves to promote learning. Contrary to this prediction, response intensity was lower when pups were present than when they were absent, and declined as the number of pups in the group increased, possibly due to costs associated with foraging with dependent young. Response intensity instead increased with increasing group size, number of group members interacting with the cue, and varied with predator cue type. These results suggest that the mobbing-like response to SPCs is not a form of teaching in meerkats. Instead, this behaviour may function to increase the recruitment of others to investigate the SPC. Exposing group members to SPCs may better inform them of the nature of the threat, facilitating more effective defensive group responses.",669,138,177,29.0

During early development, serotonin acts as neurotrophic factor, while it functions as a modulatory neurotransmitter in adulthood. The occurrence of serotonin release, could thus have different effects on behavioral outcomes, depending on the developmental period in which serotonin is released. Because serotonin is involved in the development of the HPG axis which is required for puberty establishment, serotonin could also alter expression patterns of for instance the estrogen receptor α (ERα).The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of increased serotonin levels during early development on adult female rat sexual behavior during the full behavioral estrus in a seminatural environment. To do so, rats were perinatally exposed with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (10 mg/kg FLX) and sexual performance was tested during adulthood. All facets of female sexual behavior between the first and last lordosis (behavioral estrus), and within each copulation bout of the behavioral estrus were analyzed. Besides the length and onset of the behavioral estrus and the sexual behaviors patterns, other social and conflict behavior were also investigated. In addition, we studied the effects of perinatal FLX exposure on ERα expression patterns in the medial preoptic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the dorsal raphé nucleus.The results showed that perinatal fluoxetine exposure has no effect on adult female sexual behavior. The behavioral estrus of FLX-females had the same length and pattern as CTR-females. In addition, FLX- and CTR-females showed the same amount of paracopulatory behavior and lordosis, both during the full behavioral estrus and the “most active bout”. Furthermore, no differences were found in the display of social and conflict behaviors, nor in ERα expression patterns in the brain. We conclude that increases in serotonin levels during early development do not have long-term consequences for female sexual behavior in adulthood.",877,96,165,44.0

Most importantly, BDNF is decreased in depressive patients, and increased after antidepressant treatment. Additionally, BDNF was found to be reduced in a genetic subset of depression susceptible patients carrying the human polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The serotonin knockout rat (SERT-/-) is one of the animal models used to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms behind the genetic susceptibility to depression in humans. SERT-/- rats present decreased BDNF levels, especially BDNF exon IV, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHIP), and display anxiety- and depression-like behavior. To investigate whether upregulating BDNF in the vHIP would meliorate the phenotype of SERT-/- rats, we overexpressed BDNF locally into the rat brain by means of stereotaxic surgery and submitted the animals to behavioral challenges, including the sucrose consumption, the open field, and forced swim tests. Additionally, we measured hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis reactivity. The results showed that lentivirus-induced BDNF IV overexpression in the vHIP of SERT-/- rats promoted higher sucrose preference and sucrose intake, on the first day of the sucrose consumption test, indicative for decreased anhedonia-like behavior. Moreover, it decreased immobility time in the forced swim test, suggesting adaptive passive coping. Additionally, BDNF upregulation increased the time spent in the center of a novel environment, implying decreased novel-induced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, it promoted a stronger decrease in plasma corticosterone levels 60 minutes after restraint stress. In conclusion, modulation of BDNF IV levels in the vHIP of SERT-/- rats led to a positive behavioral outcome placing BDNF upregulation in the vHIP as a potential candidate for the development new therapeutic approaches targeting the improvement of depressive symptoms.",636,123,211,18.0

Adding to the burden, the available treatments not always properly work for some individuals. There is, therefore, a constant effort from clinical and preclinical studies to bring forward a better understanding of the disease and look for novel alternative therapies. Two target systems very well explored are the serotonin and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) systems. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a commonly used class of antidepressants, target the serotonin transporter (SERT) and increase serotonin levels, which in turn also leads to an increase in BDNF. A rat model lacking SERT (SERT knockout) has been a useful tool to study the interplay between serotonin and BDNF. SERT−/− rats present increased extracellular levels of serotonin, yet BDNF levels are decreased, especially in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. The animals further display anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Therefore, BDNF might mediate the phenotype expressed by the SERT−/− rats. In this study, we sought to investigate whether overexpression of BDNF in the brain of SERT−/− rats would rescue its anxious and depressive-like behavior. Through stereotaxic surgery, SERT−/− and wild-type (WT) rats received BDNF or GFP lentivirus microinfusions into the prelimbic cortex subregion of the mPFC and were submitted to the sucrose consumption, open field test, and forced swim tests. Additionally, we measured hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis reactivity. The results revealed that SERT−/− rats presented decreased sucrose intake, decreased locomotor activity, and increased escape-oriented behavior in the forced swim test compared to WT rats. BDNF upregulation in WT rats caused alterations in the HPA-axis function, resulting in elevated basal plasma corticosterone levels and decreased plasma corticosterone upon stress. In conclusion, BDNF overexpression in the PrL, in general, did not rescue SERT−/− rats from its depression- and anxiety-like behavior, and in WT animals, it caused a malfunction in the HPA-axis.",492,102,131,17.0

Here, we investigated the effect of a brief exposure to an ITN on the biting behaviour of Anopheles mambiae mosquitoes and the interaction between such behaviour and the kdr mutation that confers resistance to pyrethroids. To this aim, we developed a video assay to study the biting behaviour of mosquitoes with similar genetic background, but different kdr locus genotypes (SS i.e. homozygous susceptible, RS i.e. heterozygous and RR i.e. homozygous resistant), after a brief exposure to either control untreated nets or one of two types of pyrethroid-treated nets (deltamethrin or permethrin). In presence of untreated nets, the kdr mutation did not influence mosquito blood feeding success but caused differences in feeding and prediuresis durations and blood meal size. Exposure to deltamethrin ITN decreased the blood feeding success rate of RR and RS mosquitoes, whereas in presence of permethrin ITN, the kdr mutation increased the blood-feeding success of mosquitoes. Exposure to the two types of pyrethroid-treated nets reduced feeding duration, prediuresis duration and blood meal size of all three genotypes. Our study demonstrates a complex interaction between insecticide exposure and the kdr mutation on the biting behavior of mosquitoes, which may substantially impact malaria vector fitness and disease transmission.",2243,221,712,20.0

Thus, individuals have to monitor interactions between others and potentially decide when and how to interfere to prevent damage to their own investment. These interventions can be subtle, as in the case of affiliative interactions such as grooming, but they can inform us about how animals structure their world and influence other group members. Here, we used interventions into grooming bouts in 29 female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to determine who intervened into which grooming bouts, why, and what determined intervention outcomes, based on kinship, dominance rank, and affiliative relationships between groomers and (potential) interveners. Using 1132 grooming bouts and 521 interventions, we show that high dominance rank of groomers reduced the risk of intervention. Bystanders, particularly when high-ranking, intervened in grooming of their kin, close affiliates, and close-ranked competitors. Interveners gained access to their close affiliates for subsequent grooming. Affiliative relationship and rank determined intervention outcomes, with reduced aggression risk facilitating grooming involving three individuals. Thus, interventions in this species involved the monitoring of grooming interactions, decision-making based on several individual and dyadic characteristics, and potentially allowed individuals to broaden their access to grooming partners, protect their own relationships, and influence their social niche.",1079,114,278,23.0

Understanding the mechanisms that drive social network dynamics requires integrating individual-level biology with comparisons across multiple social networks.Testosterone is a key mediator of vertebrate social behavior and can influence how individuals interact with social partners. Although the effects of testosterone on individual behavior are well established, no study has examined whether hormone-mediated behavior can scale up to shape the emergent properties of social networks.We investigated the relationship between testosterone and social network dynamics in the wire-tailed manakin, a lekking bird species in which male-male social interactions form complex social networks. We used an automated proximity system to longitudinally monitor several leks and we quantified the social network structure at each lek. Our analysis examines three emergent properties of the networks: social specialization (the extent to which a network is partitioned into exclusive partnerships), network stability (the overall persistence of partnerships through time), and behavioral assortment (the tendency for like to associate with like). All three properties are expected to promote the evolution of cooperation. As the predictor, we analyzed the collective testosterone of males within each social network.Social networks that were composed of high-testosterone dominant males were less specialized, less stable, and had more negative behavioral assortment, after accounting for other factors. These results support our main hypothesis that individual-level hormone physiology can predict group-level network dynamics. We also observed that larger leks with more interacting individuals had more positive behavioral assortment, suggesting that small groups may constrain the processes of homophily and behavior-matching.Overall, these results provide evidence that hormone-mediated behavior can shape the broader architecture of social groups. Groups with high average testosterone exhibit social network properties that are predicted to impede the evolution of cooperation.",1956,443,534,35.0

In pigs, manipulable materials are mandatory when no bedding is available. Like manipulable objects, positive human interactions might be considered as enrichment, as they provide the animals occasions to interact, increase their activity and lead to positive emotional states. In this study, we investigated how weaned piglets perceived a manipulable object, and a familiar human. After a similar familiarization to both stimuli, twenty-four weaned piglets were tested for a potential preference for one of the stimuli and submitted to isolation/reunion tests to evaluate the emotional value of the stimuli. We hypothesized that being reunited with a stimulus would attenuate the stress of social isolation and promote positive behaviors, and even more that the stimulus has a positive emotional value for piglets. Although our behavioural data did not allow to show a preference for one of the stimuli, piglets approached more often the human and were observed laying down only near the human. Using behavioural and bioacoustic data, we showed that reunion with the human decreased more the time spent in an attentive state and mobility of piglets than reunion with the object, and isolation. Vocalizations differed between reunions with the object and the human, and were different from vocalizations during isolation. The human presence led to higher frequency range, more noisy and shorter grunts. Finally, both stimuli decreased the isolation stress of piglets, and piglets seemed to be in a more positive emotional state with the human compared to the object. It confirms the potential need for positive human interactions to be used as pseudo-social enrichment in pigs.",820,82,182,32.0

Furthermore, they seem to be able to modulate the monoaminergic system and several behavioural aspects in insects. In particular, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) and their associated receptors orchestrate physiological processes such as feeding, locomotion and metabolism. Here we show that monoterpenes not only act as biopesticides in Drosophila species but can cause complex behavioural alterations that require a functional type 1 tyramine receptors (TAR1s). Variations in metabolic traits as well as locomotory activity were evaluated in both Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster after treatment with three monoterpenes. A TAR1−/− D. melanogaster strain was used to better understand the relationships between the receptor and monoterpenes-related behavioural changes. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that, in the D. melanogaster brain, TAR1 appeared to be expressed in areas controlling metabolism. In comparison to the D. melanogaster wild type, the TAR−/− flies showed a phenotype characterized by higher triglyceride levels and food intake as well as lower locomotory activity. The monoterpenes, tested at sublethal concentrations, were able to induce a downregulation of the TAR1 coding gene in both Drosophila species. Furthermore, monoterpenes also altered the behaviour in D. suzukii and D. melanogaster wild types 24 h after a continuous monoterpene exposure. Interestingly, they were ineffective in modifying the physiological performances of TAR1−/− flies. In conclusion, it appears that monoterpenes not only act as biopesticides for Drosophila but they can also interfere with its behaviour and metabolism in a TAR1-dependent fashion.",909,92,222,29.0

Social deficits such as those present in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders hinder the individual’s functioning in communities. Given that early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes and trajectories of ASD, there is a great need for tools to identify early markers for screening/diagnosis, and for translational animal models to uncover biological mechanisms and develop treatments. One of the most widely used screening tools for ASD in children is the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a quantitative measure used to identify individuals with atypical social behaviors. The SRS has been adapted for use in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) –a species very close to humans in terms of social behavior, brain anatomy/connectivity and development– but has not yet been validated or adapted for a necessary downward extension to younger ages matching those for ASD diagnosis in children. The goal of the present study was to adapt and validate the adult macaque SRS (mSRS) in juvenile macaques with age equivalent to 4-6 yr old human children. Expert primate coders modified the mSRS to adapt it to rate atypical social behaviors in juvenile macaques living in complex social groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Construct and face validity of this juvenile mSRS (jmSRS) was determined based on well-established and operationalized measures of social and non-social behaviors in this species using traditional behavioral observations. We found that the jmSRS identifies variability in social responsiveness of juvenile rhesus monkeys and shows strong construct/predictive validity, as well as sensitivity to detect atypical social behaviors in young male and female macaques across social status. Thus, the jmSRS provides a promising tool for translational research on macaque models of children social disorders.",748,96,550,29.0

Luminance contrast sensitivity thresholds are often poorly characterised for individual species and are applied across a diverse range of perceptual contexts using over-simplified assumptions of an animal’s visual system. Such thresholds are often estimated using the Receptor Noise Limited model (RNL) using quantum catch values and estimated noise levels of photoreceptors. However, the suitability of the RNL model to describe luminance contrast perception remains poorly tested.Here, we investigated context-dependent luminance discrimination using triggerfish (Rhinecanthus aculeatus) presented with large achromatic stimuli (spots) against uniform achromatic backgrounds of varying absolute and relative contrasts. ‘Dark’ and ‘bright’ spots were presented against relatively dark and bright backgrounds. We found significant differences in luminance discrimination thresholds across treatments. When measured using Michelson contrast, thresholds for bright spots on a bright background were significantly higher than for other scenarios, and the lowest threshold was found when dark spots were presented on dark backgrounds. Thresholds expressed in Weber contrast revealed increased contrast sensitivity for stimuli darker than their backgrounds, which is consistent with the literature. The RNL model was unable to estimate threshold scaling across scenarios as predicted by the Weber-Fechner law, highlighting limitations in the current use of the RNL model to quantify luminance contrast perception. Our study confirms that luminance contrast discrimination thresholds are context-dependent and should therefore be interpreted with caution.",933,119,239,40.0

There is strong seasonal variation in vertical ocean structuring, particularly at the poles, and deep-diving marine animals encounter a range of oceanographic conditions. We use hidden Markov models fitted to telemetry data from an air-breathing top predator to identify different diving behaviours and understand usage patterns of vertically distributed habitat. We show that preference for oceanographic conditions in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, varies by sex in Weddell seals, and present the first evidence that both sexes use high-density, continental shelf water masses. Males spend more time in the colder, unique high-salinity shelf water masses found at depth, while females also venture off the continental shelf and visit warmer, shallower pelagic water masses. Both sexes exhibit a diurnal pattern in diving behaviour that persists from austral autumn into winter. These findings provide insights into the Weddell Sea shelf and open ocean ecosystem from a top predator perspective.

Such about-and-pause pattern has three components: the bout length, the within-bout response rate, and the bout initiation rate. Previous studies have investigated how these three components are affected by experimental manipulations. However, it remains unknown what underlying mechanisms cause bout-and-pause patterns. In this article, we propose two mechanisms and examine computational models developed based on reinforcement learning. The model is characterized by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is choice—an agent makes a choice between operant and other behaviors. The second mechanism is cost—a cost is associated with the changeover of behaviors. These two mechanisms are extracted from past experimental findings. Simulation results suggested that both the choice and cost mechanisms are required to generate bout-and-pause patterns and if either of them is knocked out, the model does not generate bout-and-pause patterns. We further analyzed the proposed model and found that it reproduced the relationships between experimental manipulations and the three components that have been reported by previous studies. In addition, we showed alternative models can generate bout-and-pause patterns as long as they implement the two mechanisms.",2100,307,464,21.0

Androgens like testosterone have been strongly linked to social status, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating social status are not known. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni is a powerful model species for elucidating the role of androgens in social status given their rich social hierarchy and genetic tractability. Dominant A. burtoni males possess large testes, bright coloration, and perform aggressive and reproductive behaviors while non-dominant males do not. Social status in A. burtoni is in flux, however, as males alter their status depending on the social environment. Due to a teleost-specific whole-genome duplication, A. burtoni possess two androgen receptor (AR) paralogs, ARα and ARβ, providing a unique opportunity to disentangle the role of gene duplication in the evolution of social systems. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate AR mutant A. burtoni and performed a suite of experiments to interrogate the mechanistic basis of social dominance. We find that ARβ, but not ARα, is required for testes growth and bright coloration, while ARα, but not ARβ, is required for the performance of reproductive behavior and aggressive displays. Both receptors are required to reduce flees from females and either AR is sufficient for attacking males. Thus, social status in A. burtoni is inordinately dissociable and under the modular control of two AR paralogs. This type of non-redundancy may be important in facilitating social plasticity in A. burtoni and other species whose social status relies on social experience.Significance Statement Social rank along a hierarchy determines physiological state and behavioral performance. A ubiquitous feature of social hierarchies is the communication of rank through non-physical signaling systems (e.g., coloration) and aggression, traits that correlate with the reproductive status of an individual. Despite the links identified between social status, physiology, and behavior, the molecular basis of social status is not known. Here, we genetically dissect social status in the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We show that two distinct androgen receptor (AR) genes control social status in a highly modular manner. This type of coordination of social status may be fundamental across species that rely on social information to optimally guide physiology and behavior.",1490,176,502,30.0

Here, we investigated the drivers of conspicuous male colouration in an ontogenetic colour changing damselfly, Xanthagrion erythroneurum, where the juvenile males are yellow and change colour to red upon sexual maturity. We first showed that red males were chromatically and achromatically more conspicuous than the yellow males. We then quantified the condition of the males and showed that red males were larger and in better condition than yellow males. We tested female preference in a choice experiment where we artificially manipulated male colour, and found that females did not choose mates based on male colouration. We further tested whether the male colouration affected male-male interactions. We presented red and yellow males in the breeding arena, and found that red males received less intra- and interspecific aggression than yellow males. Our study experimentally showed, for the first time, that male conspicuousness is not a target of female mate choice in damselflies.

They provide the basis for robust experimental designs and reproducibility of results. In many countries, the determination of welfare is a mandatory legal requirement and implies the assessment of the degree of the severity that an animal experiences during an experiment. However, for an effective severity assessment, an objective and exact approach/system/strategy is needed. In light of these demands, we have developed the Relative Severity Assessment (RELSA) score.This comprehensive composite score was established on the basis of physiological and behavioral data from a surgical mouse study. Body weight, the Mouse Grimace Scale score, burrowing behavior, and the telemetry-derived parameters heart rate, heart rate variability, temperature, and general activity were used to investigate the quality of indicating severity during postoperative recovery. The RELSA scores not only revealed individual severity levels but also allowed a comparison of severity in distinct mouse models addressing colitis, sepsis, and restraint stress using a k-means clustering approach with the maximum achieved RELSA scores.We discriminated and classified data from sepsis nonsurvivors into the highest relative severity level. Data from mice after intraperitoneal transmitter implantation and sepsis survivor al were located in the next lower cluster, while data from mice subjected to colitis and restraint stress were placed in the lowest severity cluster. Analysis of individual variables and their combinations revealed model- and time-dependent contributions to severity levels.In conclusion, we propose the RELSA score as a validated tool for objective real-time applicability in severity assessment and as a first step towards a unified and accessible risk assessment tool in biomedical research.

Within the realm of animal communication, studies have traditionally focused on male signals, assuming that female choice and male-male competition have promoted sex differences via elaboration of male traits, but selection on females also has the potential to drive sexual differentiation in signals. Here, we describe female song in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) for the first time, report rates of female song production, and couple song data with plumage data to explore the relative degree to which sex differences in phenotypic traits are consistent with contemporary selection on males versus females. During previous intensive study of male song over two years, we opportunistically recorded songs for 15 females, with matched phenotypic and fitness data. We randomly selected 15 high-quality samples from our larger male dataset to test whether sex differences in song and plumage are more strongly associated with fledgling success for females or genetic paternity for males. Analyses included 35 potential sexual signals including 22 song parameters and 13 plumage traits. Outcomes indicate that: female songs were used in multiple contexts, restricted primarily to the beginning of the breeding season; song traits showed greater sexual differentiation than visual plumage traits; and trait correlations with reproductive success in females, rather than males, predicted sex-based differences in song and plumage. These results are consistent with phylogenetic studies showing that sex-based phenotypic differences are driven by changes in females, highlighting the potential role of female trait evolution in explaining patterns of sexual differentiation. To achieve a better understanding of sex differences and dimorphism, we require comprehensive studies that measure the same traits in males and females and their fitness consequences.",1512,267,623,34.0

Variation between individual predators in commonly measured personality traits, such as boldness and activity, has previously been linked to encounter rates with their prey. Given the strong selection on predators to respond to prey, individual predators may also vary consistently in their response to prey in a manner that is specific to the context of predation. By studying wild piscivorous fish (pike cichlids, Crenicichla frenata) in their natural environment using experimental presentations of prey and control stimuli, we show that individual predators differ consistently in the amount of time spent near prey. Crucially, these differences were not explained by the behaviour of the same individuals in control presentations (the same apparatus lacking prey), suggesting that variation in the response to prey reflects a ‘predator personality trait’ which is independent from other individual traits (body size, boldness and/or neophobia) and environmental factors. Pike cichlids which spent more time near prey also attacked prey at a higher rate. These findings imply that the risk posed by individual predators cannot always be adequately predicted from typically studied axes of personality variation.",964,295,290,31.0

However, these marked behaviors represent only a subset of the pair-directed behaviors that partners engage in; the influence of pair bonding on mundane or subtle social interactions among partners remains largely unknown. In the current study, we describe the changes that occur during brief social reunions (or greets) over the course of pair bonding in zebra finches. We quantified pair-directed behavior during five-minute reunions from three stages of pair bonding: initial pairing (between 4-72 hrs), early pairing (1-2 weeks) and late pairing (&gt;1 month). These social interactions were operationalized in multiples ways. First, we quantified the overall activity levels (call and movement rates) for both the male and female. Overall, females were more active than males, but for both males and females calling activity was highest during the initial timepoint (between 4-72 hrs post-pairing). We quantified behavioral coordination between partners in two ways, 1) similarity in call and movement rates between partners, and 2) temporal synchrony between calls and movements (via sliding correlation coefficients of time-stamped calls and movements). Overall there were no effects of pairing on behavioral coordination. Finally, we used principal component analyses to disentangle behavioral coordination from the activity levels of the male and female. These results contribute to a growing line of evidence that male and female zebra finches differentially contribute to social dynamics and highlight the influence of pair bonding on the development of social dynamics. Behavioral coordination is clearly important for marked interactions (e.g. duetting, courtship displays and biparental care). Our results raise the question of what the roles of such mundane social interactions are in monogamous partnerships.",697,50,183,29.0

To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized (≈ 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor– mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory.

It is currently debated which cognitive abilities support cumulative culture, but behavioural form copying is one of the main abilities proposed. One important source of contention is the presence or absence of behaviour copying in our closest living relatives, non-human great apes (apes) – especially given that their behaviour does not show clear signs of cumulation. Those who claim that apes copy behaviour often base this claim on the existence of stable ape cultures in the wild. We developed an individual-based model to test whether ape cultural patterns can emerge in absence of any behaviour copying, when only allowing for a well-supported alternative social learning mechanism, socially mediated reinnovation, where only the frequency of reinnovation is under social influence, but the form of the behaviour is not. Our model reflects wild ape life conditions, including physiological and behavioural needs, demographic and spatial features, and possible genetic and ecological variation between populations. Our results show that, under a wide range of values of parameters, we can reproduce the defining features of wild ape cultural patterns. Overall, our results show that ape cultures can emerge and stabilise without behaviour copying. Ape cultures do not show the signatures of behaviour copying abilities, lending support to the notion that behaviour copying is, among apes, unique in the human lineage.

However, in some species and populations, only some males produce these signals with other males competing for and “sneaking” reproductive opportunities. In these systems, at least three tactics are expected: always signal, signal only when others are not (assessors), and never signal. The representation of these tactics within a population is unknown in part because the costs of signaling (C) and the fitness value of a single reproductive bout (V) are unknown. Using a game-theoretic model we predict that the always signal strategy only persists if the fitness value of calling is greater than twice the cost. We also show that always signal males are apparently absent in decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus). Moreover, males of this species were not strict assessors and instead signaled infrequently (30% of the time) when signaling by others was constant. Males also exhibited substantial among-individual variation in the propensity to call when other males were not signaling (τ = 0.3). Our results suggest a high relative cost of signaling (2C &gt; V) in this species.

Here, we developed a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) protocol to assay rats’ ability to suppress cue-motivated reward seeking based on changes in reward expectancy. Traditionally, PIT studies focus on how reward-predictive cues motivate instrumental reward-seeking behavior (lever pressing). However, cues signaling imminent reward delivery also elicit countervailing focal-search responses (food-cup approach). We first examined how reward expectancy (cue-reward probability) influences expression of these competing behaviors. Adult male rats increased rates of lever pressing when presented with cues signaling lower probabilities of reward but focused their activity at the food cup on trials with cues that signaled higher probabilities of reward. We then compared adolescent and adult male rats in their responsivity to cues signaling different reward probabilities. In contrast to adults, adolescent rats did not flexibly adjust their pattern of responding based on the expected likelihood of reward delivery but increased their rate of lever pressing for both weak and strong cues. These findings indicate that impulse control over cue-motivated behavior is fundamentally dysregulated during adolescence, providing a model for studying neurobiological mechanisms of adolescent impulsivity.",813,84,166,40.0

Gaffin",2020.06.17.156612;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.156612,"Scorpions have arguably the most elaborate “tongues” on the planet: two paired ventral combs, called pectines, that are covered in thousands of chemo-tactile peg sensilla and that sweep the ground as the animal walks. Males use their pectines to detect female pheromones during the mating season, but females have pectines too: What additional purpose must the pectines serve? Why are there so many pegs? We take a computational approach to test the hypothesis that scorpions use their pectines to navigate by chemo-textural familiarity in a manner analogous to the visual navigation-by-scene-familiarity hypothesis for hymenopteran insects. We have developed a general model of navigation by familiarity with a local sensor and have chosen a range of plausible parameters for it based on the existing behavioral, physiological, morphological, and neurological understanding of the pectines. Similarly, we constructed virtual environments based on the scorpion’s native sand habitat. Using a novel methodology of highly parallel high-throughput simulations, we comprehensively tested 2160 combinations of sensory and environmental properties in each of 24 different situations, giving a total of 51,840 trials. Our results show that navigation by familiarity with a local pectine-like sensor is feasible. Further, they suggest a subtle interplay between “complexity” and “continuity” in navigation by familiarity and give the surprising result that more complexity — more detail and more information — is not always better for navigational performance.Author summary Scorpions’ pectines are intricate taste-and-touch sensory appendages that brush the ground as the animal walks. Pectines are involved in detecting pheromones, but their exquisite complexity — a pair of pectines can have around 100,000 sensory neurons — suggests that they do more. One hypothesis is “Navigation by Scene Familiarity,” which explains how bees and ants use their compound eyes to navigate home: the insect visually scans side to side as it moves, compares what it sees to scenes learned along a training path, and moves in the direction that looks most familiar. We propose that the scorpions’ pectines can be used to navigate similarly: instead of looking around, they sweep side to side sensing local chemical and textural information. We crafted simulated scorpions based on current understanding of the pectines and tested their navigational performance in virtual versions of the animals’ sandy habitat. Using a supercomputer, we varied nine environmental, sensory, and situational properties and ran a total of 51,840 trials of simulated navigation. We showed that navigation by familiarity with a local sensor like the pectines is feasible. Surprisingly, we also found that having a more detailed landscape and/or a more sensitive sensor is not always optimal.",940,308,227,34.0

Human judgments can influence machine-learning-based behavior classification at multiple steps in the process, for both supervised and unsupervised approaches. Such steps include the design of the algorithm for machine learning, the methods used for animal tracking, the choice of training images, and the benchmarking of classification outcomes. However, how these design choices contribute to the interpretation of automated behavioral classifications has not been extensively characterized. Here, we quantify the effects of experimenter choices on the outputs of automated classifiers of Drosophila social behaviors. Drosophila behaviors contain a considerable degree of variability, which was reflected in the confidence levels associated with both human and computer classifications. We found that a diversity of sex combinations and tracking features was important for robust performance of the automated classifiers. In particular, features concerning the relative position of flies contained useful information for training a machine-learning algorithm. These observations shed light on the importance of human influence on tracking algorithms, the selection of training images, and the quality of annotated sample images used to benchmark the performance of a classifier (the ‘ground truth’). Evaluation of these factors is necessary for researchers to accurately interpret behavioral data quantified by a machine-learning algorithm and to further improve automated classifications.Significance Statement Accurate quantification of animal behaviors is fundamental to neuroscience. Here, we quantitatively assess how human choices influence the performance of automated classifiers trained by a machine-learning algorithm. We found that human decisions about the computational tracking method, the training images, and the images used for performance evaluation impact both the classifier outputs and how human observers interpret the results. These factors are sometimes overlooked but are critical, especially because animal behavior is itself inherently variable. Automated quantification of animal behavior is becoming increasingly prevalent: our results provide a model for bridging the gap between traditional human annotations and computer-based annotations.

To address this question we ran two novel psychophysical experiments in which human subjects had to revert their categorical judgments about a stimulus feature, if incorrect based on feedback, before providing an estimate of the feature. If categorical judgments indeed directly altered sensory representations in working memory, subjects’ estimates should reflect some aspects of their initial (incorrect) categorical judgment in those trials.We found no traces of the initial categorical judgment. Rather, subjects seem to be able to flexibly switch their categorical judgment if needed and use the correct corresponding categorical prior to properly perform feature inference. A cross-validated model comparison also revealed that feedback may lead to selective memory recall such that only memory samples that are consistent with the categorical judgment are accepted for the inference process.

However, the biological relevance of many salivary proteins remains unknown. Here, we characterize a salivary specific Heme peroxidase family member HPX12, originally identified from Plasmodium vivax infected salivary RNAseq data of the mosquito Anopheles stephensi. We demonstrate that dsRNA silencing mediated mRNA depletion of salivary AsHPX12 (80-90%), causes enhanced host attraction but reduced blood-meal acquisition abilities, by increasing probing propensity (31%), as well as probing time (100–200s, P&lt;0.0001) as compared to control (35-90s) mosquitoes group. Altered expression of the salivary secretory and antennal proteins may account for an unusual fast release of salivary cocktail proteins, but the slowing acquisition of blood meal, possibly due to salivary homeostasis disruption of AsHPX12 silenced mosquitoes. A parallel transcriptional modulation in response to blood feeding and P. vivax infection, further establish a possible functional correlation of AsHPX12 role in salivary immune-physiology and Plasmodium sporozoites survival/transmission.

Multisensory integration is often modeled by ideal Bayesian causal inference, a model proposing that perceptual decisions arise from a statistical weighting of information from each sensory modality based on its reliability and relevance to the observer’s task.

This work tests the hypothesis that humans weight auditory and visual information in this task based on their relative reliabilities, even though the visual stimuli are task-uninformative, carrying no information about the correct response, and should be given zero weight. Listeners perform an auditory spatial discrimination task with relative reliabilities modulated by the stimulus durations. By comparing conditions in which task-uninformative visual stimuli are spatially aligned with auditory stimuli or centrally located (control condition), listeners are shown to have a larger multisensory effect when their auditory thresholds are worse.

Here we tackled this issue by pairing guppies with a biomimetic robot. We used a closed-loop tracking and feedback system to let a robotic fish naturally interact with a live partner in real time, and programmed it to strongly copy and follow its partner’s movements while lacking any preferred movement speed or directionality of its own. We show that individual differences in guppies’ movement speed were highly repeatable and shaped key collective patterns: higher individual speeds resulted in stronger leadership, lower cohesion, higher alignment, and better temporal coordination in the pairs. By combining the strengths of individual-based models and observational work with state-of-the-art robotics, we provide novel evidence that individual speed is a key, fundamental process in the emergence of collective behaviour.",1190,73,428,8.0

One critical question is how insects interact with the wind to increase their travel distance as they disperse. To gain insight into dispersal using a species amenable to further investigation using genetic tools, we conducted release-and-recapture experiments in the Mojave Desert using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We deployed chemically-baited traps in a 1 km-radius ring around the release site, equipped with machine vision systems that captured the arrival times of flies as they landed. In each experiment, we released between 30,000 and 200,000 flies. By repeating the experiments under a variety of conditions, we were able to quantify the influence of wind on flies’ dispersal behavior. Our results confirm that even tiny fruit flies could disperse ∼15 km in a single flight in still air, and might travel many times that distance in a moderate wind. The dispersal behavior of the flies is well explained by a model in which animals maintain a fixed body orientation relative to celestial cues, actively regulate groundspeed along their body axis, and allow the wind to advect them sideways. The model accounts for the observation that flies actively fan out in all directions in still air, but are increasingly advected downwind as winds intensify. In contrast, our field data do not support a Lévy flight model of dispersal, despite the fact that our experimental conditions almost perfectly match the core assumptions of that theory.Significance Statement Flying insects play a vital role in terrestrial ecosystems, and their decline over the past few decades has been implicated in a collapse of many species that depend upon them for food. By dispersing over large distances, insects transport biomass from one region to another and thus their flight behavior influences ecology on a global scale. Our experiments provide key insight into the dispersal behavior of insects, and suggest that these animals employ a single algorithm that is functionally robust in both still air and under windy conditions.

At the same time, it was found that the motility of the PWN carried by M. alternatus at 8 d after emergence was significantly greater than that of the PWN carried by the newly emerged M. alternatus. And the PWN carried by M. alternatus at 8 d after emergence was extracted more easily than the PWN carried by newly emerged beetles. These results show that greater motility was associated with easier departure of PWN from M. alternatus. In addition, transcriptome sequencing found that the level of oxidative phosphorylation metabolism of PWN carried by beetles at 8 d after emergence was significantly higher than that in the PWN carried by newly emerged beetle. High oxidative phosphorylation was associated with increased energy production and motility by the PWN and were the internal cause of the start of nematode departure.",1029,118,265,20.0

ORs represent relatively simple responses that can be used to study attentional processes, and are modulated by the organism’s state, including arousal and activation levels, as well as by emotional processes. Here we describe a simple method to study ORs in zebrafish, a model organism increasingly being used in behavioural neuroscience. After presentation of a static visual stimulus, an OR is elicited, characterized by approaching the stimulus and orienting towards it. After repeated stimulation, OR decreases, suggesting habituation. These responses are qualitatively altered by exposure to a fear-eliciting alarm substance (i.e., derived from the skin of a conspecific), since exposed animals avoid the visual stimulus and orient either away from the stimulus or towards it, but at a distance. The protocol can be used to study orienting responses, as well as the impact of fear and arousal on these reflexes.",826,212,234,21.0

Given the known heterogeneity within the autistic population, it is crucial to design tests of semantic comprehension that are sensitive in individuals. Recent efforts to develop neural signals of language comprehension have focused on the N400, a robust marker of lexical-semantic violation at the group level. However, homogeneity of response in individual neurotypical children has not been established. Here, we presented 20 neurotypical children with congruent and incongruent visual animations and spoken sentences while measuring their neural response using EEG. Despite robust group-level responses, we found high inter-individual variability in response to lexico-semantic anomalies. To overcome this, we analysed our data using temporally and spatially unconstrained MVPA, supplemented by descriptive analyses to examine the timecourse, topography, and strength of the effect. Our results show that neurotypical children exhibit heterogenous responses to lexical-semantic violation, implying that any application to heterogenous disorders such as ASD will require individual-subject analyses that are robust to variation in topology and timecourse of neural responses.",1166,197,366,34.0

However, none of these approaches has provided rigorously quantitative evidence concerning tail functions since: appropriate manipulation and controls cannot be achieved using live animals; and the aerodynamic interplay with wings and body challenges reductive theoretical or physical modelling approaches. Here, we have developed a comprehensive analytical drag model, calibrated by high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and used it to investigate the aerodynamic action of the tail by virtually manipulating its posture. The bird geometry used for CFD was reconstructed previously using stereo photogrammetry of a freely gliding barn owl and validated against wake measurements. Using this CFD-calibrated drag model, we predicted the drag production for 16 gliding flights with a range of tail postures. These observed postures are set in the context of a wider parameter sweep of theoretical postures, where the tail spread and elevation angles were manipulated virtually. The observed postures of our gliding bird corresponded to near minimal total drag.Author Summary The aerodynamic contribution of bird tails is challenging to study; strong interactions between wings, body and tail make models isolating the contributions of different body parts difficult to interpret. Further, methods for direct manipulation are limited, and confounding compensation is likely in live, free-flying birds. To circumvent these issues, we applied high-fidelity CFD to a range of measured gliding owl geometries in order to develop a comprehensive analytical drag model. This enabled the drag implications of virtually-manipulated tail postures to be explored. The theoretical postures that cause minimum drag match those used by owls. The drag model demonstrates the importance of the viscous component of drag, which is of particular relevance to fliers at the scale of birds and, increasingly, smaller UAVs.",772,93,242,24.0

Here, we explore whether dispersing individuals exhibit behavioral types that differ from those remaining in the source population. We investigated a feral population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that undergoes a yearly range shift cycle. Guppies are among the most widespread invasive species in the world, but in temperate regions these tropical fish can only survive in winter-warm freshwaters. Established in a thermally-altered stream in Germany, guppies are confined to a warm-water influx in winter, but can spread to peripheral parts as these become thermally accessible. We sampled fish from the source population and a winter-abandoned site in March, June and August. Fish were tested for boldness, sociability and activity involving open-field tests including interactions with a robotic social partner. Guppies differed consistently among each other in all three traits. Behavioral trait expression in the source population differed across seasons, however, we could not detect differences between source and downstream populations. Instead, all sampled populations exhibited a remarkably stable behavioral syndrome between boldness and activity despite strong seasonal changes in water temperature and associated environmental factors. We conclude that random drift (opposed to personality-biased dispersal) is a more likely dispersal mode for guppies, at least in the investigated stream. In the face of fluctuating environments, guppies seem to be extremely effective in keeping behavioral expressions constant, which could help explain their successful invasion and adaptation to disturbed habitats.",1421,134,359,22.0

However, this ability has only been demonstrated in a handful of species. Observational studies of Heliconius butterflies suggest that they may have an ability to form time-dependent foraging preferences. Heliconius are unique among butterflies in actively collecting and digesting pollen, a dietary behaviour linked to spatiotemporally faithful ‘trap-line’ foraging. Time-dependency of foraging preferences is hypothesised to allow Heliconius to exploit temporal predictability in alternative pollen resources, as well as contributing to optimal use of learnt foraging routes. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis, demonstrating that Heliconius hecale can learn opposing colour preferences in two time periods. This shift in preference is robust to the order of presentation, suggesting that preference is tied to the time of day and not due to ordinal learning. However, we also show that this ability is not limited to Heliconius, as previously hypothesised, but is also present in a related genus of non-pollen feeding butterflies. This demonstrates that time learning pre-dates the origin of pollen-feeding and may be prevalent across butterflies with less specialized foraging behaviours.",1240,122,283,16.0

However, in many species both males and females display such traits, although studies reporting selection acting in both sexes are scarce. In this study, we investigated whether plumage ornamentation is sexually selected in female and male lovely fairy-wrens Malurus amabilis, a cooperatively breeding songbird. We found that female and male plumage colour was correlated with parental quality but did not incur survival costs. We also found evidence of positive assortative mating based on plumage colour. Microsatellite analyses of paternity indicated that the lovely fairywren has high levels of extra-pair paternity, with 53% of offspring resulting from extra-pair mating. Female and male plumage colour did not predict reproductive success and female proportion of extra-pair offspring in its own nest, but less colourful males obtained higher extra-pair paternity. We argue that plumage colour may be under sex-specific selection, highlighting the importance of looking at both sexes in studies of sexual selection and ornament evolution. The current findings together with previous study, suggest that plumage colour in female and male lovely fairy-wrens appears to be an honest signal relevant in both intra and inter-sexual competition contexts.",485,89,208,41.0

Nassar, Wenning Deng, Oriel FeldmanHall",2020.06.06.137893;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.137893,"Predicting the behavior of others is an essential part of human cognition that enables strategic social behavior (e.g., cooperation), and is impaired in multiple clinical populations. Despite its ubiquity, social prediction poses a generalization problem that remains poorly understood: We can neither assume that others will simply repeat their past behavior in new settings, nor that their future actions are entirely unrelated to the past. Here we demonstrate that humans solve this challenge using a structure learning mechanism that uncovers other people’s latent, unobservable motives, such as greed and risk aversion. In three studies, participants were tasked with predicting the decisions of another player in multiple unique economic games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Participants achieved accurate social prediction by learning the hidden motivational structure underlying the player’s actions to cooperate or defect (e.g., that greed led to defecting in some cases but cooperation in others). This motive-based ion enabled participants to attend to information diagnostic of the player’s next move and disregard irrelevant contextual cues. Moreover, participants who successfully learned another’s motives were more strategic in a subsequent competitive interaction with that player, reflecting that accurate social structure learning can lead to more optimal social behaviors. These findings demonstrate that advantageous social behavior hinges on parsimonious and generalizable mental models that leverage others’ latent intentions.Significance statement A hallmark of human cognition is being able to predict the behavior of others. How do we achieve social prediction given that we routinely encounter others in a dizzying array of social situations? We find people achieve accurate social prediction by inferring another’s hidden motives—motives that do not necessarily have a one-to-one correspondence with observable behaviors. Participants were able to infer another’s motives using a structure learning mechanism that enabled generalization. Individuals used what they learned about others in one setting to predict their actions in an entirely new setting. This cognitive process can explain a wealth of social behaviors, ranging from strategic economic decisions to stereotyping and racial bias.",1145,226,507,31.0

Attention can be oriented exogenously (i.e., driven by salient stimuli) or endogenously (i.e., driven by one’s goals or intentions). Genetic mouse models are useful tools to investigate the neurobiology of cognition, but a well-established assessment of attention orienting in mice is missing. This study aimed to adapt the Posner task, a widely used attention orienting task in humans, for use in mice using touchscreen technology and to test the effects of two attention-modulating drugs, methylphenidate (MPH) and atomoxetine (ATX), on the performance of mice during this task. In accordance with human performance, mice responded more quickly and more accurately to validly cued targets compared to invalidly cued targets, thus supporting mice as a valid animal model to study the neural mechanisms of attention orienting. This is the first evidence that mice can be trained to voluntarily maintain their nose-poke on a touchscreen and to complete attention orienting tasks using exogenous peripheral cues and endogenous symbolic cues. The results also showed no significant effects of MPH and ATX on attention orienting, although MPH improved overall response times in mice during the exogenous orienting task.

Although wild prairie voles rarely re-pair following loss of a partner, laboratory studies have shown that previous pairing and mating does not negate the ability to form a new partner preference. However, little is known about how prior bond experience may alter the trajectory and display of a new pair bond. In the present study, we disrupted an initial pair bond by separating partners and then varied the amount of time before a new partner was introduced. We assessed how separation time affected the stability of partner preference over time and influenced decision-making in male voles performing a head-to-head partner preference test in which they chose between the first and second partner. We found that the ability to consistently display a preference for the second partner, supplanting the initial pair bond, depended on how long the test animal was separated from their first partner. Prior bonding experience also shaped the subsequent effects of mating on partner preference. Partner preference strength was sensitive to latency to mate with the second partner but not the first partner, irrespective of separation time. These results suggest that the ability to form a consistent, strong preference for a new partner after an initial pair bond depends upon the amount of time that has passed since separation from the first partner. These results provide valuable insight into how social bonds are dynamically shaped by prior social experience and identify variables that contribute to recovery from partner loss and the ability to form a new pair bond.",902,5803,310,6.0

Parental effects may evolve via a core pathway that generally prepares offspring for risky environments or could be stimuli-specific, with offspring developing phenotypes that are tailored to specific environmental challenges. We exposed threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fathers to a potentially threatening stimulus (net) versus native predator (sculpin). Offspring of sculpin-exposed fathers were more responsive (greater change in activity) to a simulated predator attack, while offspring of net-exposed fathers were less responsive (lower plasma cortisol and fewer antipredator behaviors). To evaluate offspring response to native and non-native stimuli, we sequentially exposed offspring of net-exposed, sculpin-exposed or control fathers to a net, native sculpin model, or non-native trout model. Paternal treatment did not influence offspring response to stimuli; instead, offspring were more responsive to the native sculpin predator compared to nets or non-native trout predator. Collectively, we demonstrate that sperm-mediated paternal effects in response to different, potentially stressful stimuli result in distinct offspring phenotypes. This specificity may be key to understanding the evolution of adaptive parental effects and how parents prime offspring for encountering both evolved and novel environmental stimuli.",690,82,174,27.0

Activation within reward processing regions and parietal cortex of the dog brain to 2D and 3D versions of objects was determined by their training experience, as dogs trained on one dimensionality showed greater activation to the dimension on which they were trained.

Here, we introduce an explicit approach to identify both the onset and reversals in hierarchical status among opponents and observe that distinct aggressive acts reproducibly precede, concur, or follow the establishment of dominance. We find that lunges are insufficient for establishing dominance. Rather, lunges appear to reflect the dominant state of a male and help in maintaining his social status. Lastly, we characterize the recurring and escalating structure of aggression that emerges through subsequent reversals in dominance.

House-hunting Temnothorax ants are adept at discovering and choosing the best available nest site for their colony: we propose that this is possible via rapid, decentralized estimation of the probability that each choice is best. Viewed this way, their behavioral algorithm can be understood as a statistical method that anticipates recent advances in mathematics. Our nest finding model in-corporates insights from approximate Bayesian computation as a model of colony-level behavior; and particle filtering as a model of Temnothorax ‘tandem running’. Our framework suggests that the mechanisms of complex collective behavior can sometimes be explained as a spatial enactment of Bayesian inference. It facilitates the generation of quantitative hypotheses regarding individual and collective movement behaviors when collective decisions must be made. It also points to the potential for bioinspired statistical techniques.

We extracted measures of neural lateralisation for the two tasks separately to investigate lateralisation, and we compared the left-minus-right pattern of activation across tasks to assess task-following.

Nonetheless, the pattern of hemispheric activation for the two tasks allowed us to confirm task-following in the group of participants, as well as in over half of the individuals.

Assad",2020.06.03.128272;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.128272,"SUMMARYThis manuscript is intended as a theoretical companion to Hamiloset al., 20201, in which we examined the role of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in self-timed movements. In that study, we recorded DAN signals in mice trained to initiate a licking movement after a self-timed delay following a start-timing cue. DAN signals both before the start-timing cue and during the timing interval predicted the timing of movement onset, up to seconds before the movement itself. In particular, dopaminergic signals “ramped up” from the time of the cue to the time of the movement. On a given trial, the slope of the ramping was predictive of when the movement would occur, with steep slope associated with early movement and shallow slope with late movement, reminiscent of a ramp-to-threshold process.Ramping dopaminergic signals were recently proposed in a theoretical framework that examined temporal-difference learning under resolved state uncertainty (Mikhael et al., 20192; Mikhael &amp; Gershman, 20193; Gershman, 20144). Here, we show that an adapted version of Mikhael et al.’s model recapitulates the ramping dopaminergic signaling observed in our self-timed movement task. We also applied the model to results reported in a recent temporal bisection study, in which mice categorized time intervals as relatively short or long compared to a criterion interval (Soares et al., 20165). The model successfully predicted the relative amplitude of dynamic DAN signals observed in the bisection task. These combined results suggest a common neural mechanism that broadly underlies timing behavior: trial-by-trial variation in the rate of the internal “pacemaker,” manifested in DAN signals that reflect stretching or compression of the derivative of the subjective value function relative to veridical time. In this view, faster pacemaking is associated with relatively high amplitude dopaminergic signaling, whereas slower pacemaking is associated with relatively low levels of dopaminergic signaling.",1284,118,486,27.0

In this study, we explore the relations between action and our confidence that our decision was correct or erroneous. Fifty-six volunteers took part in a perceptual decision task in which their decisions could either lead to action or not. At the end of each trial, participants rated their confidence that their decision was correct, or they reported that they had made an error. The main results showed that when given after a response, confidence ratings were higher and more strongly related to decision accuracy, and post-response reports of errors more often indicated actual errors. The results support the view that error awareness and confidence might be partially based on post-action processing.",628,69,146,20.0

One of the RT (2.5 mg/kg sc) groups served as non-treated parkinsonism model whereas the others were treated with either L-dopa (10 mg/kg PO) or with POM (150 mg/kg PO) together with each of the following; vinpocetine (VIN) (20 mg/kg PO), Propolis (300 mg/kg PO), Cocoa (24 mg/kg PO). Motor and cognitive performances were examined using three tests (catalepsy, open-field, Y-maze). Striatal dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholinesterase, GABA, Glutamate, GSK 3B, BDNF levels were assessed as well as MDA, SOD, TAC, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOs and caspase-3.

Whereas potential cultural traits are extensively investigated in chimpanzees, our other closest living relative, the bonobo, is often overlooked as a candidate model. Further, a prominent critique to many examples of proposed animal cultures is premature exclusions of environmental confounds known to shape behavioural phenotypes. We addressed these gaps by investigating variation in prey preference expression between neighbouring bonobo groups that associate and share largely overlapping home ranges. We find specific group preference for duiker or anomalure hunting that are otherwise unexplained by variation in spatial usage of hunt locations, seasonality or sizes of hunting parties. Our findings demonstrate that group-specific behaviours emerge independently of the local ecology, indicating that hunting techniques in bonobos may be culturally transmitted. We suggest that the tolerant intergroup relations of bonobos offer an ideal context to explore drivers of behavioural phenotypes, the essential investigations for phylogenetic constructs of the evolutionary origins of culture.",936,63,217,11.0

The first was a small, moving, stripy, bug-like target, made by opening a moving, Gabor-filtered window onto an extended, moving, sinewave pattern. The mantis tracked this bug-like target, but the likelihood of tracking the bug depended only on the temporal frequency of its motion. In contrast, optomotor responses to the extended moving sinewave pattern alone depended on both spatial and temporal frequency of the pattern, as expected from classical, correlation-based motion-detectors. In another experiment, we used small moving objects that were made up of chequerboard patterns of randomly arranged dark squares, and found objects with smaller sized chequers were tracked relatively less. Response suppression like this, when the internal detail of an object increases, suggests the presence of lateral inhibition between inputs to the motion-detectors for target tracking. Finally, wide-field motion of a chequerboard background near the target, balanced so no optomotor responses were evoked, suppressed tracking proportionally both to the nearness of the background to the target and to the size its dark chequered squares. Backgrounds with smaller sized squares produced more suppression. This effect has been used as a demonstration of lateral inhibition in detectors for looming-motion and makes their response greatest to an expanding outer edge, an image produced by an approaching object. Our findings point to a new role for a looming-type motion-detector in mantis target tracking. We also discuss the suitability of several large lobula-complex neurons for this role.Summary Statement Lateral inhibition shown by motion-detectors underlying target tracking by the praying mantis Sphrodromantis lineola (Linnaeus).",601,110,201,45.0

Nandini, T.N.C. Vidya",485144;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/485144,"We present a detailed study of male associations in a roving species, the Asian elephant, using six years of data on identified, nonmusth males. Adult males spent greater proportions of their time solitarily than in mixed-sex or in all-male groups. Old (over 30 years) males were sighted more frequently with their age-peers and less frequently with young (15-30 years) males than expected at random in all-male groups. Young males were not sighted more frequently with old males than with young males, and did not disproportionately initiate associations with old males. These results suggest that male associations, in the absence of females, primarily allow for old nonmusth males to test strengths against age-peers. Social learning from older individuals did not seem to be important in male associations, unlike that observed in African savannah elephants. We also found a constraint on the sizes of all-male groups, similar to that seen in female groups in our study population, and with male group sizes being smaller than that of African savannah elephants. However, most males had a significant top associate in female absence. In mixed-sex groups, male associations occurred at random, suggesting that males were tracking female groups independently. Thus, we find some differences in male social organisation compared to the phylogenetically related African savannah elephant that occupies a similar niche, and suggest that ecological factors might have shaped the differences in these male societies.",1078,323,566,53.0

However, it remains unclear how bees respond to divergent sources of social information, and whether such social cues might modify bees’ natural preferences for non-social cues (e.g. flower colour), hence affecting foraging decisions. Here, we investigated honeybees’ (Apis mellifera) inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honeybees’ preferences for flowers were recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type had declined and novel-coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or one conspecific and one heterospecific (Bombus terrestris), each foraging from a different coloured flower (magenta or yellow). Honeybees showed a natural preference for magenta flowers. Honeybees modified their inspection of both types of flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information. The presence of either demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow flower increased honeybees’ inspection of yellow flowers. Conspecific social information influenced observers’ foraging choices of yellow flowers, thus outweighing their original preference for magenta flowers. This effect was not elicited by heterospecific social information. Our results indicate that flower colour preferences of honeybees are rapidly adjusted in response to conspecific social information, which in turn is preferred over heterospecific information, possibly favouring the transmission of adaptive foraging information within species.",1265,220,359,31.0

However, how these tendencies interact with actual performance is unclear. We designed a novel task in which subjects had to learn the likelihood of achieving their goals, and the extent to which this depended on their efforts. High internality (Levenson I-score) was associated with decision making patterns that are less vulnerable to failure, and at the same time less oriented to more rewarding achievements. Our computational analyses suggested that this depended heavily on the adjustment in the perceived achievability of riskier goals following failure. We found beliefs about chance not to be explanatory of choice behaviour in our task. Beliefs about powerful others were strong predictors of behaviour, but only when subjects lacked substantial influence over the outcome.

Using operant behavioral paradigms provides rich data sets allowing for the careful analysis of behavioral phenotypes. However, one major limitation in these studies is the expense and work-load that are required using traditional methods. The equipment for commercial operant boxes can be prohibitively expensive, and the daily experimenter effort and mouse costs required for these studies is extensive. Rodents are generally trained on task-specific paradigms for months, tested every day for 5-7 days per week. Additionally, appetitive paradigms usually require food restriction and are also commonly run in the non-active light phase of the rodent circadian rhythm. These limitations make operant behavioral testing especially difficult during adolescence, a time period of interest with regards to the development of adult-like phenotypes and a high-risk period for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including those which involve impulsive behavior. In order to address these issues, we developed an automated, inexpensive, open-source method which allows the implementation of most standard operant paradigms in the homecage of rodents in shorter time frames without food restriction, and with much less experimenter effort. All construction and code for the DIY Nautiyal Automated Modular Instrumental Conditioning (DIY-NAMIC) system are open source. We demonstrate their utility here by measuring impulsive behavior in a pharmacology experiment, as well as in adolescent mice.Significance statement Rigorous behavioral assessment is critical to understand the neural basis of neuropsychiatric disorders using animal models.

While RNPs composition and role are well established, their regulation is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Hecw, a newly identified Drosophila ubiquitin ligase, is a key modulator of RNPs in oogenesis. Loss of Hecw activity results in the formation of enlarged granules that transition from a liquid to a gel-like state. At the molecular level, Hecw depletion leads to reduced ubiquitination and activity of the translational repressor Fmrp, resulting in premature Orb expression/recruitment in nurse cells. In addition to defective oogenesis, flies lacking Hecw show neurodegenerative traits with premature aging and climbing defects due to neuronal loss that are linked to RNPs condensation.

In many species, individuals form a “kin template” that they compare against conspecifics’ phenotypes to assess phenotypic similarity–and by association, relatedness. Individuals may form a kin template through self-inspection (i.e. self-referencing) and/or by observing their rearing associates (i.e. family-referencing). However, despite much interest, few empirical studies have successfully disentangled self- and family-referencing. Here, we use a novel set of breeding crosses in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to definitively disentangle referencing systems by manipulating exposure to kin from conception onwards. We show that guppies discriminate among their full- and maternal half-siblings, which can only be explained by self-referencing. Additional behavioral experiments revealed no evidence that guppies incorporate the phenotypes of their broodmates or mother into the kin template. Finally, by manipulating the format of our behavioral tests, we show that olfactory communication is both necessary and sufficient for kin discrimination. These results demonstrate that individuals recognize kin by comparing the olfactory phenotypes of conspecifics against their own.

In an effort for reward task, aged mice were less willing to exert effort for high value reward. Aged mice exhibited reduced reward sensitivity and expressed lower measures of anxiety in the novelty supressed feeding test. In a test of cognition (novel object recognition) aged mice showed no impairments but activity was lower in a measure of exploration in a novel environment. Aged mice also showed an attenuated response to restraint stress with lower corticosterone and reduced paraventricular nucleus c-fos activation.

Furthermore, saccades offer an important window into the cognitive and attentional state of the brain. Historically, saccade studies have largely relied on macaque. However, the cortical network giving rise to the saccadic command is difficult to study in macaque because relevant cortical areas lie in sulci and are difficult to access. Recently, a New World monkey – the marmoset – has garnered attention as an attractive alternative to macaque because of its smooth cortical surface, its smaller body, and its amenability to transgenic technology. However, adoption of marmoset for oculomotor research has been limited due to a lack of in-depth descriptions of marmoset saccade kinematics and their ability to perform psychophysical and cognitive tasks. Here, we directly compare free-viewing and visually-guided behavior of marmoset, macaque, and human engaged in identical tasks under similar conditions. In video free-viewing task, all species exhibited qualitatively similar saccade kinematics including saccade main sequence up to 25° in amplitude. Furthermore, the conventional bottom-up saliency model predicted gaze targets at similar rates for all species. We further verified their visually-guided behavior by training them with step and gap saccade tasks. All species showed similar gap effect and express saccades in the gap paradigm. Our results suggest that the three species have similar natural and task-guided visuomotor behavior. The marmoset can be trained on saccadic tasks and thus can serve as a model for oculomotor, attention, and cognitive research.New &amp; noteworthy We directly compared the results of video free-viewing task and visually-guided saccade tasks (step and gap) among three different species: the marmoset, macaque and human.

In biology, this challenge is particularly strong when the organism is a central place forager – returning to a nest between foraging bouts – because it is destined repeatedly to cover much the same ground. This problem will be particularly acute if many individuals forage from the same central place, as in social insects such as the ants. Foraging (sampling) performance may be greatly enhanced by coordinating movement trajectories such that each ant (‘walker’) visits separate parts of the surrounding (unknown) space. We find experimental evidence for an externalised spatial memory in Temnothorax albipennis ants: chemical markers (either pheromones or cues such as cuticular hydrocarbon footprints) that are used by nestmates to mark explored space. We show these markers could be used by the ants to scout the space surrounding their nest more efficiently through indirect coordination. We also develop a simple model of this marking behaviour that can be applied in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Baddeley et al. 2019). This substantially enhances the performance of standard methods like the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm in sampling from sparse probability distributions (such as those confronted by the ants) with little additional computational cost.

As olfaction is involved in intrinsically motivated behaviors in mice, we hypothesized that selective breeding for a voluntary behavior would enable us to identify novel roles of the chemosensory system. Voluntary wheel running (VWR) is an intrinsically motivated and naturally rewarding behavior, and even wild mice run on a wheel placed in nature. We have established 4 independent, artificially evolved mouse lines by selectively breeding individuals showing high VWR activity (High Runners; HRs), together with 4 non-selected Control lines, over 88 generations. We found that several sensory receptors in specific receptor clusters were differentially expressed between the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of HRs and Controls. Moreover, one of those clusters contains multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism loci for which the allele frequencies were significantly divergent between the HR and Control lines, i.e., loci that were affected by the selective breeding protocol. These results indicate that the VNO has become genetically differentiated between HR and Control lines during the selective breeding process, strongly suggesting the chemosensory receptors as quantitative trait loci (QTL) for voluntary exercise in mice.

We tested the hypothesis that juvenile hormone (JH) influences circadian rhythms in the social bumble bee Bombus terrestris. JH is the major gonadotropin in this species coordinating processes such as vitellogenesis, oogenesis, wax production, and behaviors associated with reproduction. It is unknown however, whether it also influences circadian processes. We topically treated newly-emerged bees with the allatoxin Precocene-I (P-I) to reduce circulating JH titers and applied the natural JH (JH-III) for replacement therapy. We repeated this experiment in three trials, each with bees from different source colonies. Measurements of ovarian activity confirmed that our JH manipulations were effective; bees treated with P-I had inactive ovaries, and this effect was fully reverted by subsequent JH treatment. We found that JH augments the strength of circadian rhythms and the pace of rhythm development in individually isolated newly emerged worker bees. JH manipulation did not affect the free-running circadian period, overall level of locomotor activity, or the amount of sleep. Given that acute manipulation at an early age produced relatively long-lasting effects, we propose that JH effect on circadian rhythms is mostly organizational, accelerating the development or integration of the circadian system.",589,64,165,35.0

To become a coherent swarm, bees locate their queen by tracking her pheromones, but how can distant individuals exploit these chemical signals which decay rapidly in space and time? Here, we combine a novel behavioral assay with the machine vision detection of organism location and scenting behavior to track the search and aggregation dynamics of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. We find that bees collectively create a communication network to propagate pheromone signals, by arranging in a specific spatial distribution where there is a characteristic distance between individuals and a characteristic direction in which individuals broadcast the signals. To better understand such a flow–mediated directional communication strategy, we connect our experimental results to an agent–based model where virtual bees with simple, local behavioral rules, exist in a flow environment. Our model shows that increased directional bias leads to a more efficient aggregation process that avoids local equilibrium configurations of isotropic communication, such as small bee clusters that persist throughout the simulation. Our results highlight a novel example of extended classical stigmergy: rather than depositing static information in the environment, individual bees locally sense and globally manipulate the physical fields of chemical concentration and airflow.",1970,269,745,19.0

Utility is the hypothetical variable that appears to be maximized by the choice. Despite the generally accepted notion that utility functions are not insensitive to external references, the exact occurrence of such changes remains largely unknown. Here we benefitted from the capacity to perform thorough and extensive experimental tests of one of our evolutionary closest, experimentally viable and intuitively understandable species, the rhesus macaque monkey. Data from thousands of binary choices demonstrated that the animals’ preferences changed dependent on the statistics of recently experienced rewards and adapted to future expected rewards. The elicited utility functions shifted and extended their shape with several months of changes in the mean and range of reward distributions. However, the adaptations were usually not complete, suggesting that past experiences remained present when anticipating future rewards. Through modelling, we found that reinforcement learning provided a strong basis for explaining these adaptations. Thus, rather than having stable and fixed preferences assumed by normative economic models, rhesus macaques flexibly shaped their preferences to optimize decision-making according to the statistics of the environment.",543,98,210,32.0

Earlier studies highlighted the implication of Kctd13 genetic imbalance in the 16p11.2 deletion through the regulation of the RHOA pathway. Here, we target the pathway and rescue the cognitive phenotypes of the 16p11.2 deletion mouse models. We used a chronic administration of fasudil (HA1077), an inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), in mouse models carrying a heterozygous inactivation of Kctd13, or the deletion of the entire 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 region. We focused our attention on the most robust cognitive phenotypes seen in the 16p11.2 models and we showed that a chronic fasudil treatment can restore object recognition memory in both mouse models but does not change other behavioural traits. These findings confirm KCTD13 as one target gene causing cognitive deficits in 16p11.2 deletion patients, and the pertinence of the RHOA pathway as a therapeutic path and reinforce the contribution of other gene(s) involved in cognitive defects found in the 16p11.2 CNV models.HIGHLIGHTS- Kctd13 haploinsufficiency recapitulates most of the behaviour phenotypes found in the 16p11.2 Del/+ models- Fasudil treatment restores Kctd13 and 16p11.2 Del/+ mutant phenotypes in novel location and novel object recognition memory tests- Fasudil treatment restores the RhoA pathway in Kctd13+/- and 16p11.2 Del/+ models",850,71,225,31.0

Recent studies suggest captive NHP populations have increased body weight over time leading to negative health outcomes. Increasing food foraging opportunities provides added calories that can be estimated but often are not directly measured. We assessed 10 commonly used foraging puzzles for the amount of foraging material they held; evaluated the range of caloric content delivered; and determine the labor and usage cost of each. Five preparation areas were sampled. The amount of foraging material contained in each prepared puzzle was calculated by subtracting the average empty puzzle weight from the loaded puzzle weight. A detailed description of food content was used to illustrate caloric content. Larger prepared puzzles held more food (M=104.9 g) as compared to small volumes puzzles (M=59.8 g). Analysis of the weight of food applied and caloric content suggest larger puzzles do have the potential to provide increased caloric load; however, the added food from large foraging puzzles constitutes only 5%-10% of the daily k/cal dietary requirement. The study illustrates the importance of considering puzzle characteristics when selecting foraging toys and discusses the considerations of cost of puzzle deployment, maintenance and interactive benefit. The broad significance of our assessment suggests that calories from foraging opportunities are not excessive and can be managed by adopting standard serving sizes and scheduling intermitted presentation of non-nutritive enrichment options.",477,109,159,25.0

For example, as a counter defense to avoid the cost of raising the unrelated offspring of obligate interspecific avian brood parasites, many host species routinely view, recognize, and remove the foreign egg(s) from their nests. Recent research has shown that host species visually attend to both chromatic and spatial pattern features of eggs; yet how hosts simultaneously integrate these features together when recognizing eggs remains an open question. Here, we tested egg rejection responses of American robins (Turdus migratorius) using a range of 3D-printed model eggs covered with blue and yellow checkered patterns differing in relative square sizes. We predicted that robins would reject a model egg if they could visually resolve the blue and yellow squares as separate features or accept it if the squares blended together and appeared similar in color to the natural blue-green color of robin eggs as perceived by the avian visual system. As predicted, the probability of robins rejecting a model egg increased with greater sizes of its blue and yellow squares.

Here, we determined whether upregulation of D2Rs and the resulting impairment in indirect pathway function modulates associative learning in an auditory Pavlovian reward learning task as well as Go/No-Go learning in an operant based reward driven Go/No-Go task. We found that upregulation of D2Rs in indirect pathway neurons of the NAc did not affect Pavlovian learning or the extinction of Pavlovian responses, and neither did it alter No-Go learning. A delay in the Go component of the task however could indicate a deficit in learning though it may be attributed to locomotor hyperactivity of the mice.

The exact etiology of this increased risk in unknown, and thus, several animal models have been developed to investigate the neuroimmune interactions of PTSD. Repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) is an established preclinical model of psychological trauma that recapitulates certain behavioral and inflammatory aspects of human PTSD. Furthermore, RSDS has been utilized to subgroup animals into susceptible and resilient populations based on one specific behavioral phenotype (i.e., social interaction). Herein, we conducted an extensive investigation of circulating inflammatory proteins after RSDS, and found significant elevations in various cytokines and chemokines after exposure to psychological trauma. When categorizing animals into either susceptible or resilient populations based on social interaction, we found no inflammatory or other behavioral differences between these subgroups. Furthermore, assessment of associations between all detectable inflammatory proteins and behavioral outputs found no significant correlation between social interaction parameters and inflammation. In contrast, we identified a panel of 5 circulating inflammatory proteins that showed significant associations with elevated zero maze parameters. Strikingly, these 5 circulating inflammatory proteins displayed a stronger predictive ability of psychological trauma exposure compared to any behavioral outcome. These findings provide new insights into inflammatory markers associated with RSDS, and their ability to predict psychological trauma exposure more robustly than commonly utilized behavioral paradigms.HighlightsRepeated social defeat stress (RSDS) reproducibly produces peripheral inflammationPeripheral inflammation is not coupled to social interaction testing parametersSusceptible and resilient categorization does not reflect peripheral inflammationAnxiety-like behavioral parameters are linked to peripheral inflammation in RSDSPeripheral inflammation is more predictive of trauma than behavior in RSDS",1161,123,218,19.0

While this variation is a prerequisite for contemporary natural selection, it is also true that selection does not act on traits in isolation. Thus, the extent to which cognitive traits covary with other aspects of phenotype (e.g. personality traits) is expected to be an important factor in shaping evolutionary dynamics. Here we adopt a multivariate approach to test for spatial learning ability in a captive population of male Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), and ask whether differences in cognitive performance are associated with (repeatable) differences in stress response behaviour. We focus on stress response for two reasons. First, functional links between cognitive traits and ‘stress coping style’ have been hypothesised. Second, individual-level studies of cognitive performance typically rely on multiple testing paradigms that may themselves be a stressor. Thus, there is a risk that variation in stress responsiveness is itself a cause of apparent, but artefactual variance in cognitive ability. Using a set of fish exposed repeatedly to two distinct spatial learning tasks (maze layouts), and an acute stress response test (open field trial), we find differences among-individuals in task performance that are repeatable within- and across maze layouts. On average performance improves with experience in the first maze, consistent with spatial learning, but not the second. In both mazes there is among-individual variation in the trajectory of mean performance with trial number suggesting individuals differing in ‘learning rate’. Acute stress response behaviour is repeatable but predicts neither average time to solve the maze nor learning rate. We thus find no support for among-individual correlation between acute stress response and cognitive performance. However, we highlight the possibility that cumulative, chronic stress effects may nonetheless cause observed declines in performance across repeats for some individuals (leading to lack of improvement in mean time to solve the second maze). If so, this may represent a pervasive but difficult challenge for our ability to robustly estimate learning rates in studies of animal cognition.",829,114,240,36.0

So far, there is no efficient treatment for PTSD other than symptomatic palliative care. Based on the implication of the functional amyloid cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-3 (CPEB3) in the consolidation of memory, we propose its active amyloid state as a possible therapeutic target by blocking the consolidation of traumatic memories through polyglutamine binding peptide 1 (QBP1), an inhibitor of the amyloid oligomerization previously investigated in Drosophila.To test this idea in mammals, here we have developed a transgenic mouse that constitutively expresses QBP1 peptide. We first assessed the innocuousness of this peptide for the normal development of the animal, which also showed normal locomotor activity and anxiety. By performing a battery of standard memory paradigms, we then showed that hippocampal-dependent and aversive memories were impaired in the QBP1 mice. Furthermore, protein expression in the hippocampi of experienced mice showed that QBP1 mice do not increase their levels of amyloid oligomerization, evincing the blockade of the CPEB3 protein in its inactive state. The ability of QBP1 to block aversive memories in mice represents the proof of concept of a novel pharmacological approach for prophylaxis and therapy of acute stress and post-traumatic stress disorders.",1754,290,442,35.0

This selection acts on both specific components of signals and overall signals that combine multiple sources of information.

Using crickets (Acheta domesticus), we evaluated competing hypotheses about signal integration and how observed patterns of signal integration fit into both systems approaches and classic signaling hypotheses. We measured three call types of 127 male crickets multiple times for a total of 930 observations. We found evidence for an underlying integrated signaling syndrome from which both intra- and intersexual signals stemmed. This syndrome was also affected by mass, suggesting honest signaling in the species. The presence of an integrated syndrome demonstrates that intra- and intersexual signals are incorporated in a redundant signal strategy in Acheta domesticus.

As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a behavioral assay to quantify innate, visually-evoked approach behaviors in freely moving mice presented with simple, computer generated stimuli of varying sizes and speeds in the lower visual field. We found that specific combinations of stimulus features selectively evoked innate approach versus freezing behavioral responses. Surprisingly, we also discovered that prey capture experience selectively modified a range of visually-guided appetitive behaviors, including increasing the probability of approach and pursuit of moving stimuli, as well as altering those visual features that evoked approach. These findings will enable the use of sophisticated genetic strategies to uncover novel neural mechanisms underlying predictive coding, innate behavioral choice, and flexible, state-dependent processing of stimuli in the mouse visual system.HighlightsNovel stimuli with specific visual features reliably elicit an approach in C57BL/6J mice.Introduction of motion to stimuli makes freezing the most probable behavioral response.Spontaneous behavioral responses are tuned to size, speed and visual field location.Prey capture experience selectively refines natural, visually-evoked approach behaviors.",2201,340,1218,24.0

Indirect evidence suggests the mushroom bodies (MB), a known site of olfactory learning [5–10], may also be the substrate for visual memory in navigation tasks [11–14]. Computational modelling shows that MB neural architecture could support this function [15, 16], though there is no direct evidence that ants require MBs for visual navigation. Here we show that lesions of MB calyces impair ants’ visual navigation to a remembered food location whilst leaving their innate responses to visual cues unaffected. Ants are innately attracted to a large visual cue but we trained them to locate a food source at a specific angle to this visual cue. Subsequent bilateral or unilateral lesioning (through procaine hydrochloride injection) of the MB calyces, caused ants to revert to their innate cue attraction whilst control (saline) injected ants still approached the feeder. The ants’ path straightness and walking speed were unaffected by lesions. Reversion towards the cue direction occurred irrespective of whether it was ipsi-or contralateral to the lesion site, showing this is not due simply to an induced motor bias. Monocular occlusion did not diminish ants’ ability to locate the feeder, suggesting the lesion is not merely interrupting visual input to the calyx. The demonstrated dissociation between innate and learnt visual responses provides direct evidence for a specific role of the MB in navigational memory.",881,49,280,17.0

The immediate biological consequence of LRRK2 mutations is to increase kinase activity, leading to the suggestion that inhibition of this enzyme might be useful therapeutically to slow disease progression. Genome-wide association studies have identified the chromosomal loci around LRRK2 and one of its proposed substrates, RAB29, as contributors towards the lifetime risk of sporadic PD. Considering the evidence for interactions between LRRK2 and RAB29 on the genetic and protein levels, here we generated a double knockout mouse model and determined whether there are any consequences on brain function with aging. From a battery of motor and non-motor behavioral tests, we noted only that 18-24 month Rab29-/- and double (Lrrk2-/-/Rab29-/-) knockout mice had diminished locomotor behavior in open field compared to wildtype mice. However, no genotype differences were seen in number of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons or in tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the SNc and striatum, which might reflect a PD-like pathology. These results suggest that depletion of both Lrrk2 and Rab29 is tolerated, at least in mice, and support that this pathway might be able to be safely targeted for therapeutics in humans.Significance statement Genetic variation in LRRK2 that result in elevated kinase activity can cause Parkinson’s disease (PD), suggesting LRRK2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. RAB29, a substrate of LRRK2, has also been associated with increased PD risk. Evidence exists for an interactive relationship between LRRK2 and RAB29. Mouse models lacking either LRRK2 or RAB29 do not show brain pathologies. We hypothesized that the loss of both targets would result in additive effects across in vivo and post-mortem assessments in aging mice.

This process allows efficient dissemination of nutrients and is crucial for the colony’s survival. In this paper, we present a data-driven agent-based model and use it to explore how the interactions of individual bees, following simple, local rules, affect the global food distribution. We design the rules in our model using laboratory experiments on honeybees. We validate its results via comparisons with the movement patterns in real bees. Using this model, we demonstrate that the efficiency of food distribution is affected by the density of the individuals, as well as the rules that govern their behavior: e.g., how they move and whether or not they aggregate. Specifically, food is distributed more efficiently when donor bees do not always feed their immediate neighbors, but instead prioritize longer motions, sharing their food with more-distant bees. This non-local pattern of food exchange enhances the overall probability that all of the bees, regardless of their position in the colony, will be fed efficiently. We also find that short-range attraction improves the efficiency of the food distribution in the simulations. Importantly, this model makes testable predictions about the effects of different bee densities, which can be validated in experiments.

Our discovery reconciles the diverse ultimate causes of tandem running across these two taxa with their apparently similar signaling mechanisms.

Whereas each of these traits has established links to drug use, the relatedness between the individual traits themselves has not been well characterized in preclinical models. To this end, the propensity to attribute incentive salience to a food cue was first assessed in a large population of 2716 outbred heterogeneous stock rats. We then determined whether this was associated with performance in two paradigms (cocaine conditioned cue preference and cocaine contextual conditioning). These measure the unconditioned locomotor effects of cocaine, as well as conditioned approach and the locomotor response to a cocaine-paired floor or context. There was large individual variability and sex differences among all traits, but they were largely independent of one another in both males and females. These findings suggest that these traits may contribute to drug-use via independent underlying neuropsychological processes.",885,62,173,34.0

We propose that insects require distinct strategies to retrace familiar routes (route-following) and directly return from novel to familiar terrain (homing) using different aspects of frequency encoded views that are processed in different neural pathways. We also demonstrate how the Central Complex and Mushroom Bodies regions of the insect brain may work in tandem to coordinate the directional output of different guidance cues through a contextually switched ring-attractor inspired by neural recordings. The resultant unified model of insect navigation reproduces behavioural data from a series of cue conflict experiments in realistic animal environments and offers testable hypotheses of where and how insects process visual cues, utilise the different information that they provide and coordinate their outputs to achieve the adaptive behaviours observed in the wild.",3256,834,1193,30.0

However, we have recently shown that the physical space for complex mixtures is ‘hyperbolic’ – curved – because of the correlations that arise in biosynthetic pathways. Here we shown that the shape of the space for flowers (Brassica rapa) using an existing data set can also be better described with a hyperbolic rather than a linear shape, and that components in the space correlate to the nectar and pollen resource sought by bee pollinators. We also show that honey bee and bumble bee antennae can detect most components of the B. rapa odor space.

This cardinal question has rarely been studied in our closest living relatives, bonobos. Yet, their striking xenophilic tendencies make them an interesting model for reconstructing the socio-emotional capacities of the last common ancestor of hominids. Within a series of dot-probe experiments, we compared bonobos’ and humans’ attention towards scenes depicting familiar (kith and kin) or unfamiliar individuals with emotional or neutral expressions. Results show that attention of bonobos is immediately captured by emotional scenes depicting unfamiliar bonobos, but not by emotional groupmates (Experiment 1) or expressions of humans, irrespective of familiarity (Experiment 2). Using a large community sample, Experiment 3 shows that human attention is mostly captured by emotional rather than neutral expressions of family and friends. On the one hand, our results show that an attentional bias towards emotions is a shared phenomenon between humans and bonobos, but on the other, that both species have their own unique evolutionarily informed bias. These findings support previously proposed adaptive explanations for xenophilia in bonobos which potentially biases them towards emotional expressions of unfamiliar conspecifics, and parochialism in humans, which makes them sensitive to the emotional expressions of close others.",1100,102,292,21.0

This study investigated an aminergic mechanism underlying defensive responses to unexpected touch in an ant that has powerful mandibles, the so-called trap-jaw. The mandibles close extremely quickly and are used as a weapon during hunting. Tactile stimulation to the abdomen elicited quick forward movements in a “dart escape” in 90% of the ants in a colony. Less than 10% of the ants responded with a quick “defensive turn” towards the source of stimulation. To reveal the neuronal control mechanisms underlying this defensive behavior, the effects of brain biogenic amines on the responses to tactile stimulus were investigated. The levels of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) in the brain were significantly elevated in ants that responded with a defensive turn to the unexpected stimulus compared to ants that responded with a dart escape. Oral administration of DA and 5HT demonstrated that both amines contributed to the initiation of a defensive response to the stimulus. Oral administration of L-DOPA weakly affected the initiation of the defensive turn, while 5HTP strongly affected the initiation of defensive behavior. Oral administration of an antagonist of 5HT, ketanserin, abolished the effect of 5HTP. These results indicate that endogenous 5HT in the brain has a key role to play in modulating the initiation of defensive behavior in the trap-jaw ant.",1028,118,315,38.0

We recently opened a new line of inquiry regarding the recall of a single object to go beyond the capacity debate, and showed that a series of feature probe questions about a single object yields poorer recall later in the sequence (Sengupta et al, 2020). In the current work we focused on another aspect of sequential feature recall - mainly regarding whether recall can be improved by asking the same question twice. To that end, we chose to focus on two features - color and location, and we contrasted repeat and non-repeat (from the standpoint of feature questions) trials in a series of two experiments. In repeat trials either color or location would be probed twice consecutively. In non-repeat trials color and location probes were presented one after the other in random order. In all trials the stimulus was a small colored oriented line presented for 1 sec in a location within 4o of visual angle. The recall of color and location were mapped onto continuous variable like Sengupta et al, 2020 - for instance, color recall was mapped onto a color wheel. In the first experiment, we used an unaltered color wheel when the color question was repeated. For the second experiment, we used a rotated color wheels for two consecutive color recall trials. We observed an increase in recall error for both repeat and non-repeat condition for location when the probe was at the second question in both experiments. However, color recall error did not increase for second repeat question condition in Experiment 1 as opposed to the non-repeat condition. On the other hand, in Experiment 2 we observed the expected increase in recall error for both repeat and non repeat condition for color probe at the second question. This maybe due to the fact that participants used an ‘anchoring’ strategy in Experiment 1 by remembering where they clicked on the color wheel in the first question. The rotation of color wheel in second experiment destroys the anchor leading to the aforementioned result. The results show that trying to recall the same feature again leads to degradation of recall accuracy for both color and location, and human beings may use different strategies for recall in working memory tasks.",541,47,126,6.0

Here, we show that bumblebees perform well on a concept-based visual discrimination task, but spontaneously switch from a concept-based solution to a simpler heuristic with extended training, all while continually increasing performance. Bumblebees were trained in an arena to find reward on displays with shapes of different sizes where they could not use low-level visual cues. One group of bees was rewarded at displays with bigger shapes and another group at displays with smaller shapes. Analysis of total choices shows bees increased their performance over 30 bouts to above chance. However, analyses of first and sequential choices suggest that after approximately 20 bouts, bumblebees changed to a win-stay/lose-switch strategy. Comparing bees’ behaviour to a probabilistic model based on a win-stay/lose-switch strategy further supports the idea that bees changed strategies with extensive training. Analyses of unrewarded tests indicate bumblebees learned and retained the concept of relative size even after they had already switched to a win-stay, lost-shift strategy. We propose that the reason for this strategy switching may be due to cognitive flexibility and efficiency.",970,66,212,24.0

Theory predicts strong selection for its effective use during communication, with functional links between signal designs and display behaviours a likely result. This is particularly true for iridescent structural colours, whose moment-to-moment appearance bears a heightened sensitivity to the position of signallers, receivers, and the sun. Here we experimentally tested this prediction using Lispe cana, a muscid fly in which males present their structurally coloured faces and wings to females during ground-based sexual displays. In field-based assays we found that males actively bias the orientation of their displays toward the solar azimuth under conditions of full sunlight and do so across the entire day. This bias breaks down, however, when the sun is naturally concealed by heavy cloud or experimentally obscured. Our modelling of the appearance of male signals revealed clear benefits for the salience of male ornaments, with a roughly four-fold increase in subjective luminance achievable through accurate display orientation. These findings offer fine-scale, causal evidence for the active control of sexual displays to enhance the appearance of iridescent signals. More broadly, they speak to predicted coevolution between dynamic signal designs and presentation behaviours, and support arguments for a richer appreciation of the fluidity of visual communication.",635,78,220,27.0

We used an experimental manipulation to determine the extent to which a California population of the wood duck (Aix sponsa) used social information gleaned from visual cues inside nest boxes that might indicate the quality or occupancy of that site. Over two nesting seasons, we manipulated the contents of newly installed boxes to simulate one of three states: (1) presence of wood duck eggs, indicating current use of a nest site; (2) presence of down and shell membranes, indicating a previously successful nest; and (3) control nests with fresh shavings indicating an unused box. In addition, we measured habitat characteristics of the area surrounding each box to assess the use of external, non-social information about each nest site. We found no evidence that females laid eggs preferentially, or that conspecific brood parasitism was more likely to occur, in any of the treatments. In contrast, nest site use and reproductive traits of wood ducks did vary with vegetation cover, and orientation and distance of the box from water. Our results suggest that personal information, not social information, influence initial nest site selection decisions when females are unfamiliar with a site. Social cues likely become increasingly important once nest sites develop their own history, and a population becomes well established.Significance Statement In selecting a nest site, birds may use many types of information, including habitat characteristics, their own previous breeding experience, or social cues inadvertently provided by other individuals of the same or different species. We examined information use in a Californian population of wood ducks by experimentally manipulating the visual cues within nest boxes and found that females did not use internal box cues to direct their nesting behaviors, appearing to rely on key habitat characteristics instead. These results contrast with previous studies of this system, suggesting that females may change the cues they use depending on their prior experience with a particular area. In the nest-site selection literature, there appears to be a divergence between research on passerines versus waterfowl, and we advocate unifying these perspectives.",556,80,182,50.0

In the literature of foraging studies, feedback mechanisms based on current target position are frequently reported. However, there have also been recent reports of animals employing feedforward mechanisms, in which prediction of future target location plays an important role. In nature, coordination of these two mechanisms may contribute to intercepting evasive prey. However, how animals weigh these two mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a behavioural experiment involving crows (which show flexible sensorimotor coordination in various domains) capturing a moving target. We changed the velocity of the target to examine how the crows utilised prediction of the target location. The analysis of moment-to-moment head movements and computational simulations revealed that the crows used prediction of future target location when the target velocity was high. In contrast, their interception depended on the current momentary position of the target when the target velocity was slow.

This expectation is well supported by both laboratory and field studies, but we don’t yet know what mechanisms facilitate these plastic responses in natural populations. One way in which males appear to assess sperm competition risk is through encounter rates with conspecific males. Such encounter rates may be driven by the spatial distribution of resources required by male. However, explicit links between resource distribution, male encounter rate, and shifts in behaviour related to sperm competition have not been demonstrated. Here we show that a small increase in the distance of patches of food resources in the laboratory: (a) approximately halves the mean distances between pairs of males; and (b) is associated with an increase in subsequent copulation duration – previously shown to be a reliable indicator of male perception of sperm competition risk – by more than two minutes. Aggregation of resources, operating via increased encounter rate, is a mechanism that can stimulate plastic male sperm competition responses. Because spatial distribution of resources, including those exploited by Drosophila, is variable in nature, this may explain one way in which sperm competition-related plasticity is influenced in wild-living males.",759,73,234,20.0

In insect societies, workers are often predisposed to specialize in different tasks, sometimes with morphological or physiological adaptations, facilitating a division of labor. Workers may also plastically switch between tasks or vary their effort. The degree to which predisposed specialization limits plasticity is not clear and has not been systematically tested in ecologically relevant contexts. We addressed this question in 20 freely-foraging bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) colonies by continually manipulating colonies to contain either a typically diverse or reduced (“homogeneous”) worker body size distribution, over two trials. Pooling both trials, diverse colonies did better in several indices of colony performance. The importance of body size was further demonstrated by the finding that foragers were larger than nurses even in homogeneous colonies with a very narrow body size range. However, the overall effect of size diversity stemmed mostly from one trial. In the other trial, homogeneous and diverse colonies showed comparable performance. By comparing behavioral profiles based on several thousand observations, we found evidence that workers in homogeneous colonies in this trial rescued colony performance by plastically increasing behavioral specialization and/or individual effort, compared to same-sized individuals in diverse colonies. Our results are consistent with a benefit to colonies of predisposed (size-diverse) specialists under certain conditions, but also suggest that plasticity or effort, can compensate for reduced (size-related) specialization. Thus, we suggest that an intricate interplay between specialization and plasticity is functionally adaptive in bumble bee colonies.",698,48,230,34.0

Using a variable foreperiod simple reaction time (RT) task in four adult male rhesus macaques, we investigated the role of the cholinergic system in alertness and temporal expectation. Foreperiod-effects on RT reflect temporal expectation, while alertness is quantified as overall response speed. We measured these RT parameters under vehicle treatment and systemic administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine. We also investigated whether and to what extent the effects of scopolamine were reversed by donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor widely used for the treatment of dementia. In the control condition, RT showed a continuous decrease as the foreperiod duration increased, which clearly indicated the effect of temporal expectation on RT. This foreperiod effect was mainly detectable on the faster tail of the RT distribution and was eliminated by scopolamine. Furthermore, scopolamine treatment slowed down the average RT. Donepezil treatment was efficient on the slower tail of the RT distribution and improved scopolamine-induced impairments only on the average RT reflecting a general beneficial effect on alertness without any improvement in temporal expectation. The present results highlight the role of the cholinergic system in temporal expectation and alertness in primates and help delineate the efficacy and scope of donepezil and other cholinomimetic agents as cognitive enhancers in present and future clinical practice.",1106,125,273,39.0

This is especially true for cooperative foraging which is thought to provide fitness benefits through more efficient acquisition and consumption of food. While examples of group foraging have been widely described, principles governing the formation of such aggregations as well as rules that determine cooperative group membership remain poorly understood. Here we take advantage of an experimental model system featuring cooperative foraging behavior in Drosophila. Under crowded conditions, fruit fly larvae form coordinated digging groups (clusters), in which individuals are linked together by sensory cues and stable group membership requires prior social experience. However, fitness benefits of Drosophila larval clustering remain to be determined. We demonstrate that when grown in crowded conditions on food that has been partially processed by other larvae, animals experience a developmental delay presumably due to the lesser nutrient value of the substrate. Intriguingly, these same conditions promote the formation of cooperative foraging clusters which further extends the larval stage compared to non-clustering animals. Remarkably, this developmental retardation also results in a relative increase in wing size, which is a good indicator of adult fitness. Thus, we find that the clustering-induced developmental delay is accompanied by adult fitness benefits. This suggests that foraging group membership provides advantages over solitary feeding in processed food. Therefore, cooperative behavior, while delaying development, may have evolved to give Drosophila larvae benefits when presented with competition for limited food resources.",1045,134,343,37.0

Similarly, neither the approach speed nor the time to cross a step obstacle was affected by lighting. To determine if tactile sensing might compensate for vision loss, we tracked antennal motion and observed shifts in spatiotemporal activity due to terrain structure but not illumination. Together, these findings suggest that vision does not impact walking performance in Argentine ant workers.

We aimed to examine whether the sexually monomorphic polka-dotted pattern on wings of Drosophila guttifera contributes to mate choice.

We further revealed that impairing the olfactory, somatosensory or auditory systems prevents recognition of familiar stimuli. Finally, we found that familiar and novel stimuli generate distinct movement patterns during social discrimination and that subjects react differentially to the movement of these stimuli. Thus, unlike what occurs in humans, social recognition in rats and mice relies on integration of information from several sensory modalities.",2125,523,822,47.0

Competition and aggression among morphs can contribute to polymorphism maintenance and color badges are useful signals in intraspecific communication, because they convey information about alternative strategies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. This could lead to an uneven spatial distribution of morphs in a population, because the local frequency of each morph establishes the intensity of the competition in that neighborhood, and then the fitness of each male. We used a polymorphic lizard, Podarcis muralis, to assess if aggression varies among morphs under two contrasting hypotheses: a heteromorphic vs. a homomorphic aggression. We used laboratory mirror tests after lizard color manipulation and we verified the results consistency with the analysis of the spatial distribution of morphs in a wild population. Both the experiments confirmed that aggression is morph-specific and notably homomorphic. The adoption of behavioral alternative strategies that minimize risks and costs of unwanted conflicts could facilitate the stable coexistence of the phenotypes and reduce the resource competition. A bias in aggression to like-coloured males would advantage rarer morph, which would suffer less harassment by common morphs and obtain a fitness advantage. This process would be negatively-frequency-dependent and would stabilize polymorphism in the populations, possibly leading to sympatric speciation.",691,168,276,22.0

In spite of that, there remains a lack of knowledge on the function of female song, with most evidence thus far focusing on females performing duets with males in courtship displays, typically for joint territory defence or mate guarding purposes. Here we show in a tracheophone suboscine passerine Formicarius moniliger, a sexually monomorphic species in which both sexes sing, that females may participate in both intrasexual and intersexual territory defence. Females sing more in response to females than to males, suggesting they consider females more of a threat to their territory. Yet, females also demonstrate an unexpected pattern of singing back to playback of males singing higher frequency song than themselves. Unlike males, who respond indiscriminately to playback of any song performed by either sex, females appear to discern not only the sex, but perhaps also the size of the presumed intruder. There is a strong negative relationship between body mass and frequency, and females responding only to higher frequency male song suggests they will only engage in territory defence with males when they expect those males to be weaker than they are. While our results are consistent with expectations of a shared ancestral function of song in territory defence, they also suggest females may suffer greater costs in engaging in territorial disputes and thus limit their vocal contribution according to the perceived threat.",1126,736,311,29.0

We administered this task, along with a targeted battery of self-report questionnaires, to a general-population sample of 146 adult participants. Using computational cognitive modelling of choices to test competing theories of information valuation, we found evidence for a model in which preferences for costless and costly information about future outcomes were independent, and in which information preference was modulated by both outcome mean and outcome variance. Critically, we also found positive associations between a model parameter controlling preference for costly information and individual differences in latent traits of both anxiety and obsessive-compulsion. These associations were invariant across different payout domains, providing evidence that individuals high in obsessive-compulsive and anxious traits show a generalised increase in willingness-to-pay for unusable information about uncertain future outcomes, even though this behaviour reduces their expected future reward.",1344,141,674,56.0

In this study, we sought to extend communication-based protocols to one species of Cercopithecids. Specifically, we looked at whether social gazing behaviour of L’Hoest’s monkeys (Allochrocebus lhoesti) is sensitive to the informational state of conspecifics using an original experimental design, thereby focusing on their ability to represent conspecifics’ rather than human experimenters’ mental states. We presented a group of 11 zoo-housed monkeys with a box that contained either an appetitive (mealworms), aversive (raptor stuffed toy) or neutral stimulus (wood bark chips). The discoverer (the first individual that inspected the content of the box) emitted more social gazes in the aversive condition than in the neutral and appetitive conditions. Besides, social gazing was related to the informational state of the conspecifics in the appetitive and neutral conditions, with more social gazes directed towards informed individuals (who had inspected the box) rather than uninformed ones (who had not inspected the box yet). Additional examination of the behaviour of the discoverers revealed that they were likely addressing social gazes to individuals who were in close proximity to them, suggesting that they preferentially gaze at informed conspecifics because the latter remained in proximity. Our study calls for a more widespread assessment of mind-reading capacities in primates, to further reveal the evolutionary history of traits that were thought to be uniquely human until fairly recently.",800,72,201,18.0

This ground effect is often modeled as an interaction between a mirrored pair of vortices represented by a true vortex and an opposite sign ‘virtual vortex’ on the other side of the wall7. However, most animals do not swim near solid surfaces and thus near body vortex-vortex interactions in open-water swimmers have been poorly investigated. In this study we examine the most energetically efficient metazoan swimmer known to date, the jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to elucidate the role that vortex interactions can play in animals that swim away from solid boundaries. We used high speed video tracking, laser-based digital particle image velocimetry (dPIV) and an algorithm for extracting pressure fields from flow velocity vectors to quantify swimming performance and the effect of near body vortex-vortex interactions. Here we show that a vortex ring (stopping vortex), created underneath the animal during the previous swim cycle, is critical for increasing propulsive performance. This well positioned stopping vortex acts in the same way as a virtual vortex during wall-effect performance enhancement, by helping converge fluid at the underside of the propulsive surface and generating significantly higher pressures which result in greater thrust. These findings advocate that jellyfish can generate a wall-effect boost in open water by creating what amounts to a ‘virtual wall’ between two real, opposite sign vortex rings. This explains the significant propulsive advantage jellyfish possess over other metazoans and represents important implications for bio-engineered propulsion systems.",559,36,185,14.0

Studies of how dominance rank affects these outcomes typically employ one of several dominance rank metrics without examining the assumptions each metric makes about its underlying competitive processes. Here we compare the ability of two dominance rank metrics—ordinal rank and proportional or ‘standardized’ rank—to predict 20 distinct traits in a well-studied wild baboon population in Amboseli, Kenya. We propose that ordinal rank best predicts outcomes when competition is density-dependent, while proportional rank best predicts outcomes when competition is density-independent. We found that for 75% (15/20) of the traits, one of the two rank metrics performed better than the other. Strikingly, all male traits were better predicted by ordinal than by proportional rank, while female traits were evenly split between being better predicted by proportional or ordinal rank. Hence, male and female traits are shaped by different competitive regimes: males’ competitive environments are largely driven by density-dependent resource access (e.g., access to estrus females), while females’ competitive environments are shaped by both density-independent resource access (e.g. distributed food resources) and density-dependent resource access. However, traits related to competition for social and mating partners are an exception to this sex-biased pattern: these traits were better predicted by ordinal rank than by proportional rank for both sexes. We argue that this method of comparing how different rank metrics predict traits of interest can be used as a way to distinguish between different competitive processes operating in animal societies.",1185,92,390,25.0

The current study utilized delay eyeblink conditioning, an associative learning task with a well-defined cerebellar circuit, to compare the behavioral effects of standard limited bedding (postnatal day 2-9, n=15) and maternal separation (60 minutes per day during postnatal day 2-14, n=13) early life stress paradigms.

Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models.Here, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology.Our simulations show that utilizing common datastream permutations to test the coefficients of regression models can lead to extremely high type I (false-positive) error rates (&gt; 30%) in the presence of non-random social structure. The magnitude of this problem is primarily dependent on the degree of non-randomness within the social structure and the intensity of samplingWe strongly recommend against utilizing datastream permutations to test regression models in animal social networks.

Participants decided which box, left or right, contained more dots and then reported their confidence in this decision. In Experiment 1, prior to confidence rating, participants were required to follow a motor cue. Cued-response type was manipulated in two dimensions: task-compatibility (the relation between response set and task-relevant decision alternatives), and stimulus-congruence (spatial correspondence between response key and the location of the stimulus that should be chosen). In Experiment 2, a decision-related response set was randomly varied in each trial, being either vertical (task incompatible) or horizontal (task-compatible, spatially congruent and incongruent). The main results showed that choice confidence increased following task-compatible responses, i.e. responses related to the alternatives of the choice in which confidence was reported. Moreover, confidence was higher in these conditions, independently of response accuracy and spatial congruence with the ‘correct’ stimuli. We interpret these results as suggesting that action appropriate in the context of a given task is an indicator of successful completion of the decision-related process.

The resulting escape trajectory (ET) – measured as the angle of escape direction relative to the predator’s approach path – plays a major role in avoiding predation. Previous geometrical models predict a single ET; however, many animals (fish and other animal taxa) show highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions. Although such a high ET variability may confer unpredictability, preventing predators from adopting counter-strategies, the reasons why animals prefer specific multiple ETs remain unclear. Here, we constructed a novel geometrical model in which Tdiff (the time difference between the prey entering the safety zone and the predator reaching that entry point) is expected to be maximized. We tested this prediction by analyzing the escape responses of Pagrus major attacked by a dummy predator. At each initial body orientation of the prey relative to the predator, our model predicts a multimodal ET with an optimal ET at the maximum Tdiff (Tdiff,1) and a suboptimal ET at a second local maximum of Tdiff (Tdiff,2). Our experiments show that when Tdiff, 1–Tdiff, 2 is negligible, the prey uses optimal or suboptimal ETs to a similar extent, in line with the idea of unpredictability. The experimentally observed ET distribution is consistent with the model, showing two large peaks at 110–130° and 170–180° away from the predator. Because various animal taxa show multiple preferred ETs similar to those observed here, this behavioral phenotype may result from convergent evolution that combines maximal Tdiff with a high level of unpredictability.Significance Statement Animals from many taxa escape from suddenly approaching threats, such as ambush predators, by using multiple preferred escape trajectories. However, the reason why these multiple preferred escape trajectories are used is still unknown. By fitting a newly constructed model to the empirical escape response data, we show that the seemingly complex multiple preferred escape trajectories can arise from a simple geometrical rule which maximizes the time difference between when the prey enters the safety zone and when the predator reaches that entry point. Our results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their escape trajectories from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.",912,152,270,51.0

Across males the expression of sexual and competitive traits, including ornamentation and aggressive behavior, is often mediated by testosterone. In the White-shouldered Fairywren (Malurus alboscapulatus) of New Guinea, females of different subspecies differ in presence or absence of white shoulder patches and melanic plumage, while males are uniformly ornamented. Previous work has shown that ornamented females circulate more testosterone and exhibit more territorial aggression than do unornamented females. We investigated the degree to which testosterone regulates expression of ornamental plumage and territorial behavior by implanting free-living unornamented females with testosterone. Every testosterone-treated female produced a male-like cloacal protuberance, and 15 of 20 replaced plucked brown feathers with white shoulder patch feathers, but did not produce melanic plumage characteristic of ornamented females. Testosterone treatment did not elevate territorial behavior prior to production of the plumage ornament and exhaustion of the implant. However, females with experimentally induced ornamentation, but exhausted implants, increased the vocal components of territory defense relative to fully unornamented control and also to testosterone-implanted females. Our results suggest that testosterone induces partial acquisition of the ornamental plumage phenotype, and that ornament expression, rather than testosterone alone, results in elevated territorial behavior.Lay Summary Testosterone regulates expression of a suite of competitive traits in male organisms and could have similar function in females. Empirical tests are needed to determine the extent to which testosterone promotes production of ornamentation and competitive behaviors in female animals. We supplemented testosterone in unornamented females of a species where naturally occurring ornamented females circulate higher testosterone and are more territorially aggressive. Implanted females produced partial ornamentation, which was followed by increased territoriality that was apparently unrelated to testosterone circulation itself.",757,109,230,27.0

Fishing Cat’s (Prionailurus viverrinus) persistence in the ‘semi-aquatic niche’ (Kitchener et al. 2010) despite felids being terrestrial carnivores in general (&gt;95%) (Hunter 2019) suggests the evolution of a successful hunting strategy. Its further suggest selection for hunting in wetlands. What energy conserving strategies did the Fishing Cat borrow from its family and how were these adapted to optimize energy gained from hunting fish, its primary prey? We attempt to answer this by analyzing 197 video footages collected opportunistically from a participatory science initiative conducted over 2.5 years. We found that the felid switches between stationary and active modes of searching for prey depending on the depth of water and the corresponding loss of body heat/energy. For example, diving in deeper waters requires the submergence of the upper portions of the body and loss of more body heat/energy. Our analysis shows that the cat spent much of its time (~52%) sitting and waiting for prey (fish) to come nearer and then took limited attempts to dive into deeper water (2.78%). We suggest that this is a strategy to optimize the net energy gain. In shallow waters where the cat could forage without submerging the upper body it adopted a predominantly active mode of hunting (~96%) to flush out prey. Thus, prominent hunting strategies in the small cat lineage like ‘sit-and-wait’ and ‘active foraging’ is adapted to hunt in the water. We recorded a 60% hunting success in deeper waters but did not detect a successful hunt in shallow waters due to the low sample size of data from shallow water hunting. The major caveat in our study is the post-hoc analysis of opportunistically collected data as opposed to data derived from a structured design with predefined objectives. With more sampling from various seasons and landscapes, finer details can be explored which would have conservation implications. For example, we would expect variations in ‘attempts to hunt’ during cold seasons because heat loss might be less of a challenge in the latter. Quantifying ‘attempts to hunt’ and ‘successful hunts’ across seasons could help focus management interventions to minimize negative interactions between fish cultivators and Fishing Cat. The strictly nocturnal activity of fishing cat as demonstrated in our study could be a strategy taken by the cat to avoid humans.

According to the social complexity hypothesis, communication complexity tends to increase with an increase in social complexity. While several studies on mammalian systems exist supporting this, evidence from avian systems is comparatively limited. Towards this, we present evidence for complex acoustic communication in a cooperatively breeding passerine, Jungle Babbler, based on three aspects of complexity: an extensive repertoire of acoustically-distinct calls, within-call structural complexity and the diverse behavioural contexts in which these calls are used. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a structurally and functionally diverse vocal repertoire comprising 15 different calls. Detailed acoustic analyses of multisyllabic calls revealed that these calls are composed of different notes. Further, despite a large number of notes present in the repertoire, the number of calls were limited to 15. This implies that there may be underlying rules that determine call composition to give rise to functional calls to which receivers respond. We also found that these calls were produced in a variety of affiliative and agonistic contexts and were employed towards coordination of diverse social behaviours including group movement, foraging, brood care, aggression and vigilance. Yet, 7 out of 15 vocalizations were produced in the context of vigilance. This disproportionate investment of vocalizations towards co-ordinated acoustic vigilance is characteristic of many cooperatively breeding birds. Our study extends support for the social complexity hypothesis and also lays the foundation for future investigations on combinatorial and syntactical rules underlying call structure and function in bird vocalizations.Significance statement Studies on vocal complexity in birds have focussed mainly on repertoire size, structure and function. However, fine temporal and spectral features of elements that constitute a call/song are rarely examined to evaluate vocal complexity. We examined complex communication in a cooperatively breeding social passerine, Jungle Babbler for which we assessed repertoire size, function, acoustic features of calls and of their constituent elements. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a structurally and functionally diverse vocal repertoire comprising of 15 calls, 46% of which were in the context of vigilance, thereby extending support to the social complexity hypothesis. We also found that several calls were composed of multiple, acoustically distinct notes. These findings will be foundational in understanding the interrelations between sociality and communicative complexity and underlying combinatorial rules that determine call structure and function.",1304,212,433,23.0

Residence times in actively-moving and inactive states were distributed in a power law-based scale-free manner. Multifractal analysis showed that temporal correlation and temporal clusterization were distinct between the actively-moving state and the inactive state.

Such a mechanistic framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the animals’ optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments investigating patch foraging behavior.",1839,802,638,28.0

However, sidewinding, often associated with sandy deserts, cuts a broad path through the environment that may increase the vulnerability to obstacles. Our prior work demonstrated that sidewinding can be represented as a pair of orthogonal body waves (vertical and horizontal) that can be independently modulated to achieve high maneuverability and incline ascent, suggesting that sidewinders may also use template modulations to negotiate obstacles. To test this hypothesis, we recorded overhead video of four sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) crossing a line of vertical pegs placed in the substrate. Snakes used three methods to traverse the obstacles: a Propagate Through behavior in which the lifted moving portion of the snake was deformed around the peg and dragged through as the snake continued sidewinding (115/160 runs), Reversal turns that reorient the snake entirely (35/160), or switching to Concertina locomotion (10/160). The Propagate-Through response was only used if the anterior-most region of static contact would propagate along a path anterior to the peg, or if a new region of static contact could be formed near the head to satisfy this condition; otherwise, snakes could only use Reversal Turns or switch to Concertina locomotion. Reversal Turns allowed the snake to re-orient and either escape without further peg contact or resorting to Propagate Through. We developed an algorithm to reproduce the Propagate Through behavior in a robotic model using a modulation of the two-wave template. This range of behavioral strategies provides sidewinders with a versatile range of options for effectively negotiating obstacles in their natural habitat, as well as provide insights into the design and control of robotic systems dealing with heterogeneous habitats.",633,151,253,46.0

Comparative studies of variation in cognitive skills allow testing of evolutionary hypotheses addressing socioecological factors driving the evolution of primate brain size. However, data on cognitive abilities for meaningful interspecific comparisons are only available for haplorhine primates (great apes, Old- and New World monkeys) although strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) serve as the best living models of ancestral primate cognitive skills, linking primates to other mammals. To begin filling this gap, we tested members of three lemur species (Microcebus murinus, Varecia variegata, Lemur catta) with the Primate Cognition Test Battery, a comprehensive set of experiments addressing physical and social cognitive skills that has previously been used in studies of haplorhines. We found no significant differences in cognitive performance among lemur species and, surprisingly, their average performance was not different from that of haplorhines in many aspects. Specifically, lemurs’ overall performance was inferior in the physical domain but matched that of haplorhines in the social domain. These results question a clear-cut link between brain size and cognitive skills, suggesting a more domain-specific distribution of cognitive abilities in primates, and indicate more continuity in cognitive abilities across primate lineages than previously thought.",963,1101,507,33.0

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of supplemental Trp and a 12-week incremental training regimen on the voluntary activity and behaviour of client-owned Siberian Huskies. Sixteen dogs were blocked for age, BW and sex and then randomly allocated to either the control or treatment group. Both groups were fed the same dry extruded diet; however, the treatment group were supplemented with Trp to achieve a Trp: large neutral amino acid ratio of 0.075:1. Once a week, a 5-minute video recording was taken immediately pre- and post- exercise to evaluate dogs’ behaviours. Activity monitors were used to record voluntary activity on both training and rest days. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between training week and time spent performing each behaviour. Additionally, a repeated measure mixed model was used to test differences between diet groups and training week for both behavioural and activity count data. The time spent performing agonistic behaviours prior to exercise was negatively associated with week for treatment dogs (β = −0.32, 95% CI [−0.55, −0.10], P &lt; 0.05) and no change was observed for control dogs (β = −0.13, 95% CI [−0.41, 0.15], P &gt; 0.10). Treatment did not have any effect on activity levels (P &gt; 0.10). For all dogs, locomotive behaviours decreased prior to exercise as weeks progressed (P &lt; 0.05), while run day voluntary activity depended on the distance run that day (P &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that sled dogs experience an exercise-induced reduction in voluntary locomotion in response to both single bouts and repetitive bouts of exercise.

This likely contributes to limited translational impact. A major bottleneck for the adoption of socially complex, ethology-rich, preclinical procedures are the technical limitations for consistently annotating detailed behavioral repertoires of rodent social behavior. Manual annotation is subjective, prone to observer drift, and extremely time-intensive. Commercial approaches are expensive and inferior to manual annotation. Open-source alternatives often require significant investments in specialized hardware and significant computational and programming knowledge. By combining recent computational advances in convolutional neural networks and pose-estimation with further machine learning analysis, complex rodent social behavior is primed for inclusion under the umbrella of computational neuroethology.Here we present an open-source package with graphical interface and workflow (Simple Behavioral Analysis, SimBA) that uses pose-estimation to create supervised machine learning predictive classifiers of rodent social behavior, with millisecond resolution and accuracies that can out-perform human observers. SimBA does not require specialized video acquisition hardware nor extensive computational background. Standard descriptive statistical analysis, along with graphical region of interest annotation, are provided in addition to predictive classifier generation. To increase ease-of-use for behavioural neuroscientists, we designed SimBA with accessible menus for pre-processing videos, annotating behavioural training datasets, selecting advanced machine learning options, robust classifier validation functions and flexible visualizations tools. This allows for predictive classifier transparency, explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. We demonstrate that this approach is flexible and robust in both mice and rats by classifying social behaviors that are commonly central to the study of brain function and social motivation. Finally, we provide a library of poseestimation weights and behavioral predictive classifiers for resident-intruder behaviors in mice and rats. All code and data, together with detailed tutorials and documentation, are available on the SimBA GitHub repository.Graphical  SimBA graphical interface (GUI) for creating supervised machine learning classifiers of rodent social behavior.(a) Pre-process videos. SimBA supports common video pre-processing functions (e.g., cropping, clipping, sampling, format conversion, etc.) that can be performed either on single videos, or as a batch.(b) Managing poseestimation data and creating classification projects. Pose-estimation tracking projects in DeepLabCut and DeepPoseKit can be either imported or created and managed within the SimBA graphical user interface, and the tracking results are imported into SimBA classification projects.SimBA also supports userdrawn region-of-interests (ROIs) for descriptive statistics of animal movements, or as features in machine learning classification projects.(c) Create classifiers, perform classifications, and analyze classification data. SimBA has graphical tools for correcting poseestimation tracking inaccuracies when multiple subjects are within a single frame, annotating behavioral events from videos, and optimizing machine learning hyperparameters and discrimination thresholds. A number of validation checkpoints and logs are included for increased classifier explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. Both detailed and summary data are provided at the end of classifier analysis. SimBA accepts behavioral annotations generated elsewhere (such as through JWatcher) that can be imported into SimBA classification projects.(d) Visualize classification results.

Our aims were three-fold. First, we sought to establish the sensitivity of two auditory paradigms to elicit neural responses in individual neurotypical children. Second, we aimed to validate the use of a portable and accessible electroencephalography (EEG) system, by comparing its recordings to those of a research-grade system. Third, in light of substantial inter-individual variability in individuals’ neural responses, we assessed whether multivariate decoding methods could improve sensitivity.Methods We tested the sensitivity of two child-friendly covert N400 paradigms. Thirty-one typically developing children listened to identical spoken words that were either strongly predicted by the preceding context or violated lexical-semantic expectations. Context was given by a cue word (Experiment 1) or sentence frame (Experiment 2) and participants either made an overall judgement on word relatedness or counted lexical-semantic violations. We measured EEG concurrently from a research-grade system, Neuroscan’s SynAmps2, and an adapted gaming system, Emotiv’s EPOC+.Results We found substantial inter-individual variability in the timing and topology of N400-like effects. For both paradigms and EEG systems, traditional N400 effects at the expected sensors and time points were statistically significant in around 50% of individuals. Using multivariate analyses, detection rate increased to 88% of individuals for the research-grade system in the sentences paradigm, illustrating the robustness of this method in the face of inter-individual variations in topography.Conclusions There was large inter-individual variability in neural responses, suggesting inter-individual variation in either the cognitive response to lexical-semantic violations, and/or the neural substrate of that response. Around half of our neurotypical participants showed the expected N400 effect at the expected location and time point. A low-cost, accessible EEG system provided comparable data for univariate analysis but was not well suited to multivariate decoding. However, multivariate analyses with a research-grade EEG system increased our detection rate to 88% of individuals. This approach provides a strong foundation to establish a neural index of language comprehension in children with limited communication.",1430,150,721,58.0

Some important factors that determine shoal choice are shoal size, familiarity and species composition. However, individuals and species often exhibit distinct shoaling preferences. Individual differences in shoaling preferences may also be related to personality traits such as boldness and sociability. In this study, we examined the link between shoaling decisions and personality traits in a hatchery reared population of an endangered megafish, the Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree). We found that this fish exhibits a distinct preference for larger shoals at ratios of 1:2 or greater. However, they did not prefer to associate with an isolated familiar individual over unfamiliar ones or with a member of their own species over an invasive species. Moreover, shoaling preferences in individuals did not correlate with their boldness or sociability. These results suggest that hatchery reared mahseers which are reintroduced into natural habitats may shoal with invasive species, negatively affecting their viability. Modifying social behaviour of mahseers by amending rearing practices may be a useful strategy to improve outcomes of restocking interventions.",933,69,280,26.0

Learning walks are performed at the start of an ant’s foraging career or when the appearance of the nest surrounding has changed. We investigated here whether the structure of such learning walks in the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis takes into account wind direction in conjunction with the learning of new visual information. Ants learnt to travel back and forth between their nest and a feeder, and we then introduced a black cylinder near their nest to induce learning walks in regular foragers. By doing this across days with different prevailing wind directions, we were able to probe how ants balance the influence of different sensory modalities. We found that (i) the ants’ outwards headings are influenced by the direction of the wind with their routes deflected in such a way that they will arrive downwind of their nest when homing, (ii) a novel object along the route induces learning walks in experienced ants and (iii) the structure of learning walks is shaped by the wind direction rather than the position of the visual cue.",700,51,175,16.0

Sickness behavior did not appear to change call structure, but it decreased the number of contact calls produced.

Many studies have focused on their characteristic opercular flaring, while the less aggressive and less energetically costly lateral display have been comparatively understudied. Many factors have been shown to influence aggression in Bettas, notably body length and the personality trait of boldness, however, the role that colour plays in determining an individual’s aggressiveness is much less clear. The role of colour has only been briefly studied, and based on human interpretations of colour, i.e. limited to what the receivers’ eyes and sensory systems actually can process and discriminate, with results suggesting blue males are more aggressive than red males. Using male-male interactions, measuring opercular flaring and lateral display we found that colour and personality do play a role in determining the degree of aggressiveness in Betta splendens. Blue-finned males were more aggressive, performing longer lateral displays more frequently. Blue fins are a phenotype observed in wild type males and is likely selected for to allow visual cues to travel through the murky water they inhabit. Body mass was positively correlated with lateral display frequency, and opercular flare frequency and duration. Finally, neophobic individuals – individuals that were less willing to approach a novel object – were more aggressive, performing significantly more lateral displays. This indicates that personality may impact fighting strategy, with males either choosing to end conflicts quickly with more aggressive displays or to outlast their opponent with less energetically costly displays.",875,327,1067,11.0

Less well studied are the potential costs associated with being dominant. Here, the movement of two flocks of domestic homing pigeons (Columba livia) – measured via accelerometry loggers – was recorded over a period of two weeks. Movement was then used to calculate each individual’s daily overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA, G), which can be used as a proxy for energy expenditure. The dominance hierarchy of the two flocks was determined via group-level antagonistic interactions, and demonstrated a significantly linear structure. The most dominant bird within each flock was found to move significantly more than conspecifics – on average, c.39% greater than the individual with the next highest degree of movement – indicating a possible cost to possessing the top rank within a hierarchy. Despite the dominance hierarchy being linear, mean daily total ODBA did not reflect a linear nature, with no pattern observed between rank and ODBA, once the top ranked individuals had been accounted for. This suggest that energy expenditure may be more reflective of a despotic hierarchy.

Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/ memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication.",922,269,322,22.0

We measured the temporo-spatial and kinetic parameters of quadrupedal gait using a custom-built pressure-sensing walkway and compared the left- and right-side parameters to assess the symmetry of the gait pattern. All temporo-spatial and kinetic parameter values showed no significant differences among the nine rhesus monkeys for both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. However, significant differences were observed between forelimb and hindlimb kinetic parameters such as peak vertical force, vertical impulse, and the percentage of body weight distribution. All kinetic parameter values were higher for the forelimbs than for the hindlimbs. These data indicated that the center of gravity in healthy rhesus monkeys is located at the forelimbs rather than at the hindlimbs while walking. Furthermore, the symmetry indices considered for symmetric gait pattern showed a low variability.

Outre la mise en évidence de l’adéquation de la trajectoire et du comportement de l’animal avec les caractéristiques hydrologiques et trophiques de chaque localisation, cela a permis de détecter une vingtaine de nouvelles boucles et des phases d’inertie dans la trajectoire de la baleine, et de les apparenter à des phases de sommeil. Pour cela il fallait démontrer quélles se répétaient chaque jour.",1029,155,290,17.0

Across diverse taxa, animals vary in their capacities for social recognition but the ecological and social sources of selection for recognition are often unclear. In a comparative study of two closely related species of poison frogs, we identified a species difference in social recognition of territory neighbors and investigated potential sources of selection underlying this difference. In response to acoustic playbacks, male golden rocket frogs (Anomaloglossus beebei) recognized the calls of neighbors and displayed a “dear enemy effect” by responding less aggressively to neighbors’ calls than strangers’ calls. In contrast, male Kai rocket frogs (Anomaloglossus kaiei) were equally aggressive to the calls of neighbors and strangers. This species difference in behavior was associated with key differences in reproductive ecology and characteristics of territories. Golden rocket frogs defended reproductive resources in the form of bromeliads, which is expected to create a threat asymmetry between neighbors and strangers favoring decreased aggression to neighbors. In contrast, Kai rocket frogs did not defend reproductive resources. Further, compared with Kai rocket frog territories, golden rocket frog territories occurred at higher densities and were defended for longer periods of time, creating a more complex social environment with more opportunities for repeated but unnecessary aggression between neighbors, which should favor the ability to recognize and exhibit less aggression towards neighbors. These results suggest that differences in reproductive ecology can drive changes in social structure that select for social recognition.",867,111,373,43.0

The relationships of offspring with other hyenas are similar to those of their mothers over up to six years, and the degree of similarity increases with maternal social rank. The strength of mother-offspring relationship affects social inheritance and is positively correlated with offspring longevity.

Is this property common across societies? The forms of infant-directed vocalizations may be shaped by their function in parent-infant communication. If so, infant-directed song and speech should be differentiable from adult-directed song and speech on the basis of their acoustic features, and this property should be relatively invariant across cultures. To test this hypothesis, we built a corpus of 1,614 recordings of infant- and adult-directed singing and speech produced by 411 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies. We studied the corpus in a massive online experiment and in a series of acoustic analyses. Naïve listeners (N = 13,218) reliably identified infant-directed vocalizations as infant-directed, and adult-directed speech (but not songs) as adult-directed, at rates far higher than chance. Ratings of infant-directed song were the most accurate and the most consistent across all societies; infant-directed speech was accurately identified on average, but inconsistently across societies. To determine the mechanisms underlying these results, we extracted many acoustic features from each recording and identified those that most reliably characterize infant-directed song and speech across cultures, via preregistered exploratory-confirmatory analyses and machine classification. The features distinguishing infant- and adult-directed song and speech concerned pitch, rhythmic, phonetic, and timbral attributes; a hypothesis-free classifier with cross-validation across societies reliably identified all vocalization types, with highest accuracy for infant-directed song. Last, we isolated 12 acoustic features that were predictive of perceived infant-directedness; of these, two pitch attributes (median F0 and its variability) were by far the most explanatory. These findings demonstrate cross-cultural regularities in infant-directed vocalizations that are suggestive of universality; moreover, infant-directed song appears to be more cross-culturally stereotyped than infant-directed speech, informing hypotheses of the functions and evolution of both.",4595,348,936,29.0

Predation risk and wind-induced perturbations in the canopy may further impede the movement process. In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, first-instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address such vertical movements and associated sensory cues in E. tiaratum nymphs. Newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, travelling &gt;100 m within 60 minutes. Navigation toward open canopies is underpinned by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis, and visual responses to vertically oriented contrast patterns. Nymphal E. tiaratum also use directed jumping to cross air gaps, and respond to tactile stimulation and potential threat with a self-dropping reflex, resulting aerial descent. Post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum thus consists of visually mediated displacement both on vegetational structures and in the air; within the latter context, gliding is then an effective mechanism enabling recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent. These results further support the importance of a diurnal niche, in addition to the arboreal spatial niche, in the evolution of gliding in wingless arboreal invertebrates.Summary statement To effectively disperse into canopies, ground-hatched stick insects use gravity and visual cues to navigate during midday, jump to cross air gaps and respond to threat or perturbation with self-dropping.",1301,218,415,26.0

While deficits in cognitive flexibility have previously been examined in rodent PD models using the cross-maze, T-maze, and a food-digging task, the current study is the first to examine such deficits using a 3-choice serial reaction time task (3-CSRT) with reversal learning (3-CSRT-R). Although the rate of acquisition in 3-CSRT was slower in lesioned compared to control rats, lesioned animals were able to acquire a level of accuracy comparable to that of control animals following 16 days of training.

This approach can be combined with multi-view information, generating prediction enhancement using all four dimensions (3D space and time). To evaluate OptiFlex, we adopted datasets of four different lab animal species (mouse, fruit fly, zebrafish, and monkey) and proposed a more intuitive evaluation metric - percentage of correct key points (aPCK).

This fast attachment mechanism allows the young of precocial bird species to learn the characteristics of conspicuous visual stimuli and display affiliative response to them. Although more prolonged exposure to an object produces a stronger preference for it afterwards, this relation is not linear. Chicks can even prefer to approach novel rather than familiar objects at some stages of imprinting. The time course and stability of imprinting has just started to be investigated. To date, little is known about how filial preferences develop across time, due to the challenges in assessing individual performance. This study aimed to investigate filial preferences for familiar and novel imprinting objects over time. We have used an automated setup to track the behaviour of chicks continuously for subsequent days. After hatching, chicks were individually placed in an arena where stimuli were displayed on two opposite screens. The duration of exposure and the type of stimuli were manipulated while the time spent at the imprinting stimulus was monitored across six days. We showed that prolonged exposure (3 days vs 1 day) to a stimulus produced robust filial imprinting preferences. Interestingly, with a shorter exposure (1 day), animals re-evaluated their filial preferences in functions of their innate preferences and past experiences. Our study suggests that predispositions influence learning when the imprinting memories are not fully consolidated, driving animal preferences toward more predisposed stimuli.",935,115,349,25.0

Here, we further develop this idea by considering how simulation noise may be adaptively modulated by task demands, based on principles of rational inattention. We show how the optimal allocation of mental effort can give rise to the magnitude effect in intertemporal choice. In a re-analysis of two prior data sets, and in a new experiment, we reveal several behavioral signatures of this novel theoretical account, tying choice stochasticity to the magnitude effect.

Despite this, preclinical research commonly focuses on adult males. Here we use Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction in adolescent male and female rats to understand sex- and age-dependent processes relevant to anxiety disorders. In experiment 1, 35-day-old male and female rats were exposed to 6 pairings of a conditioned stimulus (CS, a tone) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, a footshock). The next day they were extinguished in a contextually distinct chamber, via 60 presentations of the CS without the US. Extinction recall was tested 24 hours later in the extinction context. Estrous phase was monitored by cytology on vaginal smears taken 1 hour after each behavioral session. In experiment 2, male and female rats were given sham surgery or gonadectomy at 21 days of age. They were then trained and tested as for experiment 1. We observed that females in proestrus or met/diestrus during extinction showed delayed extinction and impaired extinction recall the next day compared to males. Ovariectomy enhanced extinction for female rats, but orchidectomy delayed extinction for males. Plasma analyses showed that met/di/proestrus phases were associated with high estradiol levels. These findings suggest that high plasma estradiol levels impair extinction for adolescent females. While these results contradict what is observed in adult animals, they are consistent with the prevalence of anxiety disorders observed in females. Our findings have important implications for understanding and treating anxiety in adolescents, particularly where treatment involves extinction-based therapies.",868,511,314,26.0

We conducted a field experiment to investigate how sickness behaviour reduces individual connectedness in a high-resolution dynamic social network. We captured adult female vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from a wild roost. To create ‘sick’ bats, we injected a random half of the bats (n=16) with the immune-challenging substance, lipopolysaccharide, and injected control bats with saline (n=15). Over the next three days, we used proximity sensors to continuously track their associations under natural conditions. The ‘sick’ bats showed a clear decrease in social connectedness (degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality). Bats in the control group encountered fewer ‘sick’ bats and also spent less time near them. These effects varied by time of day and declined over 48 hours. High-resolution proximity data allow researchers to define network connections based on how a pathogen spreads (e.g. the minimum contact time or distance for transmission). We therefore show how the estimate of the sickness effect changes as network ties are defined using varying distances and durations of association. Tracking the effects of sickness behaviour on high-resolution dynamic social networks can help create more sophisticated simulations of pathogen transmission through structured populations.",1676,732,507,17.0

As most primates live in permanent social groups, their members must balance the benefits of group living with the costs of intragroup competition for resources. However, some taxa live in more spatiotemporally flexible social groups, whose members modify patterns of association and range use as a method to mitigate these costs. Here, we describe the range use of black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) at Mangevo, an undisturbed primary rainforest site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar and characterize sex-differences in annual home range area, overlap, and daily distances traveled. Moreover, we characterized seasonal variability in range use and ask whether ranging behaviors can be explained by either climatic or reproductive seasonality. We found that females used significantly larger home ranges than males, though sexes shared equal and moderate levels of home range overlap. Overall, range use did not vary across seasons; though within sexes, male range use varied significantly with climatic variation. Moreover, daily path length was best predicted by day length, female reproductive state, and sex. While the patterns of range use and spatial association presented here share some similarities with ‘bisexually bonded’ community models described for chimpanzees, we argue that ruffed lemurs represent yet another community model wherein ‘neighborhoods’ of overlapping males and females affiliate with each other moreso than with other, more distantly located community members, and to the exclusion of members from adjacent communities.",584,136,315,56.0

However, a detailed comparison of the facial activities occurring during pain is not possible. We used a Facial Action Coding System modified for horses to code and analyse video recordings from an earlier study of acute short-term experimental pain and from clinical cases with and without pain. We demonstrated for the first time EquiFACS based changes to pain in video of horses, using traditional statistical methods based on frequency, and novel analyses based on sliding observation windows and co-occurrence of facial actions. The most prominent differences of the experimental horses were related to the lower face actions chin raiser and nostril dilator, while less prominent, but significantly more frequent actions were related to the eye region, inner brow raiser (AU101), increased eye white (AD1), half blink (AU47), and ear rotator (EAD104). Ears forward (EAD101) and eye blink (AU145) were not associated to pain. Based on this we selected the two lower face actions for analysis of the clinical videos, and found that their co-occurrence within a window of 10 to 15 second gave 100% positive predictive values, as compared to the rating from three expert pain raters. Using our developed co-occurrence analyses we were surprised to detect that the chance of identifying three or more of the facial actions related to pain in 0.04 second sequence, corresponding to one frame, was below 3%, indicating that use of randomly selected images for pain scoring may be a very insensitive method.",627,224,339,14.0

Two of the prime factors regulating mating decisions are the presence of competing conspecifics and predatory threats, both of which have important fitness consequences for the individual. We studied the influence of these two factors separately in mate search tactics and association preferences among zebrafish males. Male zebrafish were presented with a choice of two patches, consisting of different number of females, of which one patch was also associated with a predatory threat. We found that males made a preferential choice for the patch with more number of females only when the numerical difference between choices are starkly different, irrespective of the predatory threat associated with the patch. This points towards the role of numerical cognition in assessing cost-benefit tradeoffs in male zebrafish. We also studied the association preference of males in a multi-choice setup, consisting of four separate mixed-sex groups of zebrafish varying in densities. Our results showed that while test males preferred to visit the male-biased patches more often, they spent more time near female-biased patches or patches with equal sex ratio patches indicating the role of complex interplay of social cues in determining the associative behavior of males to a patch.

Between individuals of a given species, the acoustic structure of INs and the number of times INs are repeated before song varies considerably. While similar variation in songs between individuals is known to be a result of learning, whether INs are also learned remains poorly understood. Here, using natural and experimental tutoring with male zebra finches, we show that mean IN number and IN acoustic structure are learned from a tutor, independent of song learning. We also reveal biological predispositions in IN production; birds artificially tutored with songs lacking INs still repeated a short-duration syllable, thrice on average, before their songs. Overall, these results show that INs, just like elements in song, are shaped both by learning and biological predispositions and suggest multiple, independent, learning processes underlying the acquisition of complex vocal displays.",1017,276,382,20.0

However, SSRIs can cross the placenta and affect the development of the fetus. The effects of perinatal SSRI exposure, and especially the effects on social behavior, are still incompletely documented. This study first aims to investigate whether rats show prosocial behavior in the form of consolation behavior. Secondly, it aims to investigate whether perinatal SSRI exposure affects this prosocial behavior. At last, we investigate whether the behavior changed after the rats had been exposed to an additional white-noise stressor.Rat dams received 10 mg/kg/d fluoxetine (FLX) or vehicle (CTR) via oral gavage from gestational day 1 until postnatal day 21. At adulthood, the rat offspring were housed in four cohorts of 4 females and 4 males in a seminatural environment. As prosocial behaviors are more prominent after stressful situations, we investigated the behavioral response of rats immediately after natural aggressive encounters (fights). Additionally, we studied whether a stressful white-noise exposure would alter this response to the aggressive encounters.Our study indicates that CTR-female rats are able to show third party prosocial behavior in response to witnessing aggressive encounters between conspecifics in a seminatural environment. In addition, we showed that perinatal FLX exposure impairs the display of prosocial behavior in female rats. Moreover, we found no signs of prosocial behavior in CTR- and FLX-males after natural aggressive encounters. After white-noise exposure the effects in third party prosocial behavior of CTR-females ceased to exist. We conclude that female rats are able to show prosocial behavior, possibly in the form of consolation behavior.

(Leguminosae), which grows in various warm climates such as the Middle East, Asia, and Southern Europe. It is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs and is referred to as “the father of herbal medicine.” Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) (Fig. 1A), a triterpenoid saponin, is a major component of licorice. It has a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, neuroprotective, and immune effects, among others.[1]. Previous studies indicated that GA produces robust neuroprotection via the modulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, primarily through the ERK signaling pathway and its anti-inflammatory properties against high-mobility group box 1 phosphorylation and the suppression of inflammatory cytokine induction [2-4]. These results were based on pathological models. Although numerous pathways have been implicated in the neuroprotective effects of GA, the molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of GA in preventing age-related immune involution and cognitive disorders, the relationship between immune involution and cognition, and the underlying molecular mechanisms.",1220,75,239,13.0

Engelmann, Maël Lebreton",593368;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/593368,"In simple instrumental-learning tasks, humans learn to seek gains and to avoid losses equally well. Yet, two effects of valence are observed. First, decisions in loss-contexts are slower, which is consistent with the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) hypothesis. Second, loss contexts decrease individuals’ confidence in their choices – a bias akin to a Pavlovian-to-metacognitive transfer (PMT). Whether these two effects are two manifestations of a single mechanism or whether they can be partially dissociated is unknown. Here, across six experiments, we attempted to disrupt the PIT effects by manipulating the mapping between decisions and actions and imposing constraints on response times (RTs). Our goal was to assess the presence of the metacognitive bias in the absence of the RT bias. Were observed both PIT and PMT despite our disruption attempts, establishing that the effects of valence on motor and metacognitive responses are very robust and replicable. Nonetheless, within- and between-individual inferences reveal that the confidence bias resists the disruption of the RT bias. Therefore, although concomitant in most cases, PMT and PIT seem to be – partly – dissociable. These results highlight new important mechanistic constraints that should be incorporated in learning models to jointly explain choice, reaction times and confidence.",1859,447,637,35.0

The results indicate that typically developed adults perform better than adults with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the evidence regarding the validity and reliability of the test is contradictory. This study evaluated the effect of the glossary on the performance, internal consistency, and temporal stability of the test. A total of 89 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to three conditions. The first group used the original glossary (Ori-G). The second group developed a self-generated glossary of gazes (Self-G). Finally, the third group developed a glossary that did not define gazes, but unrelated words instead (No-G). The test was administered before and after participants drew a randomly assigned image as a secondary task. The findings show that the number of correct answers was similar among the three conditions before and after the secondary task. However, the Self-G and No-G groups took less time to finish the test.

Anticipatory studies have poorly considered vocalisations whereas they carry information about the emotional state. We studied the grunts of piglets that anticipated two (pseudo)social events known to elicit positive emotions more or less intense: arrival of a familiar conspecifics and arrival of a familiar human. Both time and spectral features of the vocal expression of piglets differed according to the emotional context. Piglets produced low-frequency grunts at a higher rate when anticipating conspecifics compared to human. Spectral noise increased when piglets expected conspecifics, whereas the duration and frequency range increased when expecting a human. When the arrival of conspecifics was delayed grunts duration increased, while when the arrival of the human was delayed spectral parameters were comparable to those during isolation. This shows that vocal expressions in piglets during anticipation are specific to the expected reward and to the time duration between signal and the delivery of the reward. Vocal expression (time and spectral features) is thus a good way to explore emotional state of piglets during anticipation of challenging events.",1248,129,237,31.0

By contrast, the individual zebrafish showed marked changes, completely losing their preference for all the tested color combinations. To investigate the role of shoaling behavior in color preference, we selected a D1-receptor antagonist (SCH23390), which could disrupt social preference and decrease social interaction in zebrafish. Interestingly, the shoals that were treated by SCH23390 showed no color preference for all color combinations. Our findings indicate that social interaction is involved in color-driven behavior in zebrafish, and reveal the possible mechanisms that the dopaminergic system may contribute to innate color preference in shoals of zebrafish.",738,212,220,32.0

In this study, we tested if maternal stress affects measures of stress and fear in five strains of layer breeders: commercial brown 1 &amp; 2, commercial white 1 &amp; 2 and a pure line White Leghorn. Each strain was equally separated into two groups: “Maternal Stress” (MS), where hens were subjected to a series of 8 consecutive days of acute psychological stressors, and “Control,” which received routine husbandry. Additional eggs from Control were injected either with corticosterone diluted in a vehicle solution (“CORT”) or just “Vehicle.” Stress- and fear-responses of the offspring were measured in a plasma corticosterone test and a combined human approach and novel object test. Both MS and CORT treatments failed to affect the measured endpoints in the offspring, but significant strain differences were found. The offspring of the white strains showed a higher physiological response compared to brown strains, but the White 2 offspring was consistently the least fearful strain in the behaviour tests. Our study found that the acute psychological stressors experienced by layer breeders did not affect the parameters tested in their offspring and that corticosterone does not seem to be the primary mediator of maternal stress in laying hens. This is highly important, as in poultry production, layer breeders are often subjected to short-term stressors. In addition, we successfully dissociated the physiological and behavioural parameters of stress response in laying hens, showing that increased concentrations of plasma corticosterone in response to stress is not directly associated with high levels of fear.",606,98,176,42.0

In this case, a method such as exponential moving average (EMA) with a discounting rate is used to improve the ability to respond to a sudden change; it is also necessary to increase the discounting rate. That is, a trade-off is established in which the followability is improved by increasing the discounting rate, but the accuracy is reduced. Here, we propose an extended Bayesian inference (EBI), wherein human-like causal inference is incorporated. We show that both the learning and forgetting effects are introduced into Bayesian inference by incorporating the causal inference. We evaluate the estimation performance of the EBI through the learning task of a dynamically changing Gaussian mixture model. In the evaluation, the EBI performance is compared with those of the EMA and a sequential discounting expectation-maximization algorithm.

In a separate experiment, foragers showed stronger phototactic response compared to nurses only in one of two trials in which they were larger and tested with weak light intensity.

Behavioral biases that arise from these priors could increase positive outcomes when the priors match the true structure of the environment, but mismatches also happen frequently and could cause unfavorable outcomes. Biases that reduce gains and fail to vanish with training indicate fundamental suboptimalities arising from ingrained heuristics of the brain. Here, we report systematic, gain-reducing choice biases in highly-trained monkeys performing a motion direction discrimination task where only the current stimulus is behaviorally relevant. The monkey’s bias fluctuated at two distinct time scales: slow, spanning tens to hundreds of trials, and fast, arising from choices and outcomes of the most recent trials. Our finding enabled single trial prediction of biases, which influenced the choice especially on trials with weak stimuli. The pre-stimulus activity of neuronal ensembles in the monkey prearcuate gyrus represented these biases as an offset along the decision axis in the state space. This offset persisted throughout the stimulus viewing period, when sensory information was integrated, leading to a biased choice. The pre-stimulus representation of history-dependent bias was functionally indistinguishable from the neural representation of upcoming choice before stimulus onset, validating our model of single-trial biases and suggesting that pre-stimulus representation of choice could be fully defined by biases inferred from behavioral history. Our results indicate that the prearcuate gyrus reflects intrinsic heuristics that compute bias signals, as well as the mechanisms that integrate them into the oculomotor decision-making process.",1459,105,495,41.0

This long-range mass-sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing substrate stiffness, or addition of a mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channel inhibitor. Computational modeling revealed that Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its growth perimeter that is distorted above a threshold strain – a fundamentally novel method of mechanosensation.

Allocation of feeding resources, including stocking rates, prior to and during the breeding season is a crucial determinant of this vital rate. Thus, quantification of effects and interaction among multiple factors that affect pregnancy rate is essential for management and conservation of pasture-based systems. Pregnancy rate of 2982 heifers and primiparous cows was studied as a function of animal category, average daily gain during the breeding season, stocking rate, pasture type and body weight at the beginning of the breeding season. Data were obtained from 43 experiments conducted in commercial ranches and research stations in the Pampas region between 1976 and 2015. Stocking rate ranged from 200 to 464 kg live weight/ha, which brackets values for most of the grazinglands in similar regions. Age at breeding was 14-36 months (24.6 ± 7.5 months); initial breeding weights were 129-506 kg and 194-570 kg for heifers and primiparous cows. Pregnancy rate was modeled with an apriori set of explanatory variables where proximate variables (breed, body weight at start of breeding, weight gain during breeding and category) were included first and subsequently modeled as functions of other variables (pasture type, supplementation and stocking rate). This modeling approach allowed detection of direct and indirect effects (through nutrition and body weight) of factors that affect pregnancy rate. Taurine (Bos taurus breeds, N = 1058) had higher pregnancy rate than B. Taurus x B. indicus crossbreed (N = 1924) females. Pregnancy rate of heifers and primiparous cows grazing in natural grasslands decreased with increasing stocking rate, but no effect of stocking rate was detected in cultivated and improved pastures. Pregnancy rate increased with increasing average daily gain during the breeding season. Use of cultivated or improved natural pastures promotes higher pregnancy rate, as well as allows higher in stocking rate at the regional level. Body weight at the start of the breeding season is the primary determinant of pregnancy rates in heifer and primiparous cows.",603,59,158,39.0

These strongly-correlated collective displays have inspired numerous mathematical models to explain how global synchronous patterns emerge from local interactions. Yet, experimental data to validate these models remains sparse. To address this gap, we develop a method for three-dimensional tracking of firefly flashes, using a stereoscopic setup of 360-degree cameras. We apply this method to record flashing displays of the North American synchronous species Photinus carolinus in its natural habitat as well as within controlled environments, and obtain the 3D reconstruction of flash occurrences in the swarm. Our results show that even a small number of interacting males synchronize their flashes; however, periodic flash bursts only occur in groups larger than 15 males. Moreover, flash occurrences are correlated over several meters, indicating long-range interactions. While this suggests emergent collective behaviour and cooperation, we identify distinct individual trajectories that hint at additional competitive mechanisms. These reveal possible behavioural differentiation with early flashers being more mobile and flashing longer than late followers. Our experimental technique is inexpensive and easily implemented. It is extensible to tracking light communication in various firefly species and flight trajectories in other insect swarms.",2409,341,678,14.0

We catalog six functionally distinct mechanisms related to the acquisition of resources, and we model these mechanisms’ effects on the survival of individuals foraging in groups. We find that whether, and to what degree, optimal group size increases, decreases, or remains constant when resource abundance declines depends strongly on the dominant mechanism. Existing empirical data support our model predictions, and we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict the dominant social benefit for particular species.

Behavioural syndromes are often displayed by invasive species but the role of activity rhythms in biological invasions is unknown. Here, we investigated whether early nocturnal activity (the relative amount of locomotor activity displayed early in the night) and risk-taking behaviour (i.e. response to a scare stimulus) form a behavioural syndrome in a major invasive species, the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). We first characterized daily rhythms of locomotor activity over five days under controlled laboratory conditions and then scored the response to a scare stimulus across two different contexts (neutral and food) two days apart within the following six days. Crayfish displayed overall daily activity rhythms peaking in the first four hours of darkness. Both early nocturnal activity and risk-taking behaviour showed consistent inter-individual differences with repeatability scores of 0.20 and 0.35, respectively. However, the two behavioural traits were not correlated as in a behavioural syndrome. We argue that in contrast to other behavioural syndromes, a link between early nocturnal activity and risk-taking tendency would not be evolutionary stable as it dramatically increases predictability and therefore predatory pressure to individuals. We suggest that daily activity rhythms and risk-taking behavior can be important traits in understanding the adaptations underlying biological invasions or other processes of contemporary evolution.",937,143,254,15.0

Available methods to quantify mosquito flight usually require special devices and mostly assess spontaneous locomotor activity at individual level. Here, we developed a new method to determine longitudinal untethered adult A. aegypti induced flight activity: the INduced FLight Activity TEst (INFLATE). This method was an adaptation of the “rapid iterative negative geotaxis” assay to assess locomotor activity in Drosophila and explore the spontaneous behavior of mosquito to fly upon a physical stress. Insects were placed on a plastic cage previously divided in four vertical quadrants and flight performance was carried out by tapping cages towards the laboratory bench. After one minute, the number of insects per quadrant was registered by visual inspection and categorized in five different scores. By using INFLATE, we observed that flight performance was not influenced by repeated testing, sex or 5 % ethanol intake. However, induced flight activity was strongly affected by aging, blood meal and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. This simple and rapid method allows the longitudinal assessment of induced flight activity of multiple untethered mosquitoes and may contribute to a better understanding of A. aegypti dispersal biology.AbbreviationsRINGRapid iterative negative geotaxisINFLATEInduced flight activity testHzHertzIFMindirect flight muscles",585,124,231,27.0

Loss of α7 nAChRs resulted in a decrease of postnatal granule cells, as indicated by reduced GFAP+ cells in the DG, specifically in male mice, as well as sex-dependent changes in several behaviors, including social recognition, object investigation, and spatial learning. Overall, these findings suggest α7 nAChRs expressed in GABAergic interneurons play an important role in regulating postnatal neurogenesis and behavior in a sex-dependent manner. This provides important insight into the mechanisms by which cholinergic dysfunction contributes to the cognitive and behavioral changes associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.",615,184,201,22.0
894,Testosterone and cortisol are negatively associated with ritualized bonding behavior in male macaques,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/765123v2,"Alan V. Rincon, Michael Heistermann, Oliver Schülke, Julia Ostner",765123;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/765123,"Neuroendocrine research on the formation of social bonds has primarily focused on the role of nonapeptides. However, steroid hormones often act simultaneously to either inhibit or facilitate bonding. Testosterone is proposed to mediate a trade-off between male mating effort and nurturing behavior; therefore, low levels are predicted during periods of nurturing infant care and social bonding. In species where social bonding and support regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, we also expect glucocorticoid levels to be low during bonding periods. We investigated how immunoreactive urinary testosterone (iuT) and cortisol (iuC) were related to triadic male-infant-male interactions – a ritualized male bonding behavior – as well as infant care in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We collected &gt;3000 hours of behavioral observation data during full-day focal animal follows from 14 adult males and quantified iuT and iuC from 650 urine samples. As predicted, both iuT and iuC were negatively correlated with rates of triadic interactions within-subjects in the hours preceding urination. We found no relationship between iuT and iuC with triadic interactions between-subjects. Infant care was weakly positively correlated to iuT and iuC within-subjects, but not between-subjects. The observed negative relationship between iuT and triadic interactions may be beneficial to lower competitive tendencies between adult males and to not inhibit bond formation. Lowered iuC could reflect increased bonding and perceived social support as triadic interactions predict future coalition formation in this species. Additionally, lowered iuC may be reflective of buffered tensions between males. The positive relationship of iuT and iuC with infant care suggests that the handling of infants in may be less nurturing but rather protective or competitive in this species. Measuring steroid hormones in relation to bonding and nurturing can help us interpret behaviors within the ecological contexts that they occur.",1147,208,479,33.0

All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 – 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 – 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001) and platelet (P ≤ 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect.

As such, confidence is thought to be an important computation for a variety of cognitive and perceptual processes, and it features heavily in theorizing about conscious access to perceptual states. Recent experiments have revealed a “positive evidence bias” (PEB) in the computations underlying confidence reports. A PEB occurs when confidence, unlike objective choice, over-weights the evidence for the chosen option, relative to evidence against the chosen option. Accordingly, in a perceptual task, appropriate stimulus conditions can be arranged that produce selective changes in confidence reports but no changes in accuracy. Although the PEB is generally assumed to reflect the observer’s perceptual and/or decision processes, post-decisional accounts have not been ruled out. We therefore asked whether the PEB persisted under novel conditions that eliminated two possible post-decisional accounts: 1) post-decision evidence accumulation that contributes to a confidence report solicited after the perceptual choice, and 2) a memory bias that emerges in the delay between the stimulus offset and the confidence report. We found that even when the stimulus remained on the screen until observers responded, and when observers reported their choice and confidence simultaneously, the PEB still emerged. Signal detection-based modeling also showed that the PEB was not associated with changes to metacognitive efficiency, but rather to confidence criteria. We conclude that once-plausible post-decisional accounts of the PEB do not explain the bias, bolstering the idea that it is perceptual or decisional in nature.",1060,231,501,17.0

The ecdysteroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), transferred from male to female during copulation, is key to An. gambiae reproductive success as it licenses females to oviposit eggs developed after blood feeding. Here we show that 20E-triggered oviposition in these mosquitoes is regulated by the stress- and immune-responsive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The heads of mated females exhibit a transcriptional signature reminiscent of a JNK-dependent wounding response while mating — or injection of virgins with exogenous 20E — selectively activates JNK in the same tissue. RNAi-mediated depletion of JNK pathway components inhibits oviposition in mated females, whereas JNK activation by silencing the JNK phosphatase puckered induces egg laying in virgins. Together, these data identify JNK as a potential conduit linking stress responses and reproductive success in the most important vector of malaria.",648,141,302,35.0

However, little is understood regarding the effects of cannabinoids on cognitive processes. Given that deficient risk-taking is commonly observed in individuals suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs), we assessed the impact of manipulating cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs; the primary target for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the brain) on punishment-based risk-taking using the risky decision-making task (RDT) in male Long-Evans rats. The RDT measures preference for small, safe rewards over large, risky rewards associated with an escalating chance of foot shock. Systemic bidirectional CB1R manipulation with a CB1R agonist, CB1R antagonist, and FAAH inhibitor (which increases overall endocannabinoid tone) did not alter overt risk-taking in the RDT. Interestingly, direct CB1R agonism, but not indirect CB1R stimulation or CB1R blockade, resulted in reduction in latency to make risky choices while not altering safe choice latency. Our findings suggest that CB1R activation expedites engagement in punishment based risk-taking without affecting overall preference for risky vs. safe options. This indicates that risk preference and rate of deliberation for risk-taking are influenced by distinct neural substrates, an important consideration for development of precise treatments targeting the aberrant risk-taking typical of SUD symptomology.",655,101,159,25.0

Mantis shrimp of the species Neogonodactylus oerstedii return to their burrows between foraging excursions using path integration, a vector-based navigational strategy that is prone to accumulated error. Here we show that N. oerstedii can navigate using landmarks in parallel with their path integration system, offseting error generated when navigating using solely path integration. We also report that when the path integration and landmark navigation systems are placed in conflict, N. oerstedii will orient using either system or even switch systems enroute. How they make the decision to trust one navigational system over another is unclear. These findings add to our understanding of the refined navigational toolkit N. oerstedii relies upon to efficiently navigate back to its burrow, complementing its robust, yet error prone, path integration system with landmark guidance.",849,126,260,28.0

At the same time, technological improvements now allow for generating large datasets of high sampled GPS data over a long period of time. However, such datasets often remain unused or used only in part due to the lack of practical models that can directly infer the desired features from raw GPS locations and the complexity of existing approaches. Some of them being disputed for their lack of rational or biological justifications in their design. We propose a simple model of individual movement with explicit parameters based on essential features of animal behavior. The main thrust was to stick to empirical observations, rather than using black-box models that could possibly perform very well while providing little insight from an ecological perspective. We used a simple model, based on a two-dimensional biased and correlated random walk with three forces related to advection, attraction and immobility of the animal. These forces can be directly estimated using individual raw GPS data. The performance of the model is assessed through 5 statistics that describe the spatial features of animal movement. We demonstrate the approach by using GPS data of 5 roe deer with high frequency sampling. We show that combining the three forces significantly improves the model performance. We also found that the model’s parameters are not affected by the sampling rate of the GPS, suggesting that our model could also be used with low frequency sampling GPS devices. Additionally, the practical design of the model was verified for detecting spatial feature abnormalities (such as voids) and for providing estimates of density and abundance of wild animals. Our results show that a simple and practicable random walk template can account for the spatial complexity of wild animals. Integrating even more additional features of animal movement, such as individuals’ interactions or environmental repellents, could help to better understand the spatial behavior of wild animals.",978,1189,549,10.0

We analysed serum cortisol levels of 115 samples using a radioimmunoassay and compared sampling month, hunting grounds, age classes and sexes, as well as possible correlations between cortisol level and weight and pregnancy status of female wild boar. We found that cortisol levels during these drive hunts exhibit wide variation. The mean cortisol level was 411.16 nmol/L with levels ranging from 30.60 nmol/L (minimum) to 1,457.92 nmol/L (maximum). Comparing age groups and sexes, we found significant differences between the sexes, with females having a higher cortisol levels than males.

We found no correlation between cortisol levels and weight, but significantly higher cortisol levels in pregnant females compared to non-pregnant females. No differences were found between sampling months and locations, respectively.

Such variation is biologically relevant, because it reflects variation in reaction norms. Between-individual variation in average phenotypes is typically quantified as random-intercept variation in linear mixed-effects models or as intra-class correlations (also known as repeatability). Similarly, context-sensitivity can be modelled as random-slope variation. However, random-slope variation implies that between-individual variation varies across the range of a covariate (environment, context, time or age) and has thus been called ‘conditional’ repeatability. While studies fitting random-slope models are on a rapid increase, there is a lack of a general concept for the quantification of context-sensitive between-individual variation. We here propose to put reaction-norm (random-slope) variation in perspective of the total phenotypic variance and suggest a way of standardization that we call random-slope coefficient of determination . Furthermore, we illustrate that instead of the random-intercept variance, the average repeatability across an environmental gradient will be a biologically more relevant description of between-individual variation and we call this the marginalized repeatability Rmar. We provide simple equation to calculated key descriptors of conditional repeatabilities, clarify the difference between random-intercept variation and average between-individual variation and make recommendations for comprehensive reporting. Most importantly, reporting should include means and variances of covariates.

Sex is a proxy for multiple genetic and endocrine influences that can influence decision-making strategies, including how environments are sampled. In this study, we examined the strategies adopted by female and male mice as they learned the value of stimuli that varied in both image and location in a visually-cued two-armed bandit, allowing two possible dimensions to learn about. Female mice acquired the correct image-value associations more quickly than male mice, and they used a fundamentally different strategy to do so. Female mice constrained their decision-space early in learning by preferentially sampling one location over which images varied. Conversely, male strategies were inconsistent, changing frequently and strongly influenced by the immediate experience of stochastic rewards. Individual strategies were related to sex-gated changes in neuronal activation in early learning. Together, we find that in mice, sex is linked with divergent strategies for sampling and learning about the world, revealing substantial unrecognized variability in the approaches implemented during value-based decision-making.",2884,494,928,35.0

The debate regarding working memory has been largely between slots and resource based models. The resource model suggests that as the number of items increases, precision of recall decreases because neural resources are dynamically allocate to all the objects needed for task. Slot model on the other hand implies that an item is stored either with the highest precision or not at all. If both these models stand true then quality of memory performance would be near perfect for a single object. However, that may not be the case. In the current work, we investigated recall accuracy for feature(s) of a single object in three successive experiments. In all three experiments, the memory array consisted of a single colored oriented short line presented a short distance away from the center of the display for 1 sec. We probed recall of features from the set of color, location, orientation, and size. In experiment 1 number of recall question varied between 1 – 4 with the order randomized in each trial. In experiment 2 we chose to probe only two feature recall questions, whereas only one recall question was probed for the third experiment. In experiment 3 we varied the delay before the recall probe between 1 and 2 s. The recall response for each feature was mapped on to a continuous variable. Subjects used a color wheel to respond to color, on-screen mouse click to indicate center of the line location, click away from the center to indicate size, and a mouse click to the periphery of centered circle to indicate orientation with the slant of the resulting radial line. We calculated z-scores of errors for each feature for every subject separately. In experiment 1 that for color, location, and size the errors increase significantly with the position of the questions asked. In experiment 2, the errors increased significantly between questions for color and location (but not for orientation and size). In experiment 3, we did not see any significant increase in error with recall probe delay. Overall run-time for each trial was within 10 secs, well within the limits of operation of working memory.

Assays of short term memory revealed an age-dependent requirement of m6A writers working via YTHDF, but not YTHDC, comprising the first phenotypes assigned to Drosophila mutants of the cytoplasmic m6A reader. These factors promote memory via neural-autonomous activities, and are required in the mushroom body, the center for associative learning. To inform their basis, we mapped m6A from wild-type and mettl3 null mutant heads, allowing robust discrimination of Mettl3-dependent m6A sites. In contrast to mammalian m6A, which is predominant in 3’ UTRs, Drosophila m6A is highly enriched in 5’ UTRs and occurs in an adenosine-rich context. Genomic analyses demonstrate that Drosophila m6A does not directionally affect RNA stability, but is preferentially deposited on genes with low translational efficiency. However, functional tests indicate a role for m6A in translational activation, since we observe reduced nascent protein synthesis in mettl3-KO cells. Finally, we show that ectopic YTHDF can increase m6A target reporter output in an m6A-binding dependent manner, and that this activity is required for in vivo neural function of YTHDF in memory. Altogether, we provide the first tissue-specific m6A maps in this model organism and reveal selective behavioral and translational defects for m6A/YTHDF mutants.",1785,473,1293,67.0

We used a perceptual discrimination task in which participants reported their stimulus awareness. We created two conditions: No-feedback and Feedback (discrimination accuracy feedback was provided at the end of each trial). The results showed that visual awareness judgments are related to the accuracy of current and previous responses. Participants reported lower stimulus awareness for incorrectly versus correctly discriminated stimuli in both conditions; they also reported lower stimulus awareness in trials preceded by incorrect discrimination responses, compared to trials preceded by correct discrimination. This difference was significantly stronger in the Feedback condition. Moreover, in the Feedback condition we also observed larger post-error slowing for PAS ratings.

To investigate whether neural homophily between friends exists at rest we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 68 school-aged girls, along with social network information from all pupils in their year groups (total 5,066 social dyads). Participants were asked to rate the amount of time they voluntarily spent with each person in their year group, and directed social network matrices and community structure were then determined from these data. No statistically significant relationships between social distance, community homogeneity and similarity of global-level resting-state connectivity were observed. Nor were we able to predict social distance using a machine learning technique (i.e. elastic net regression based on the local-level similarities in resting-state whole-brain connectivity between participants). Although neural homophily between friends exists when viewing naturalistic stimuli, this finding did not extend to functional connectivity at rest in our population. Instead, resting-state connectivity may be less susceptible to the influences of a person’s social environment.",1760,358,479,28.0

The future of these dogs is often pessimistic (early euthanasia or placement in rescues/fosters, lack of interactions and activities for adults). These pessimistic scenarios result from popular assumptions predicting that dogs with congenital hearing/vision impairments exhibit severe Merle-related health troubles (cardiac, skeletal, neurological), impairment-related behavioural troubles (aggressiveness, anxiety), and poor capacities to communicate, to be trained, and to be engaged in leisure or work activities. However, there is no direct scientific testing, and hence no evidence or refutation, of these assumptions. We therefore addressed an online questionnaire to owners of 223 congenitally sensory impaired (23 vision impaired, 63 hearing impaired, 137 hearing and vision impaired) and 217 sensory normal dogs from various countries. The sensory normal cohort was matched in age, lifetime with owner, breed and sex with the sensory impaired cohort, and was used as a baseline. The questionnaire assessed demographics, morphology, sensory impairments, health and behavioural troubles, activities, and dog-owner communication. Most hearing and vision impaired dogs exhibited abnormal pigment deletion in their coat and irises. Vision impaired dogs additionally exhibited ophthalmic abnormalities related to Merle. The results refute all above-listed assumptions, except for neurological troubles. We however suggest that reports of neurological troubles could be partially accounted for by lacks of diagnosis of breed-related drug sensitivity and impairment-related compulsive behaviours. Results about communication and activities are particularly optimistic.

But few social systems afford sufficient control over group composition to precisely quantify its effects on individual and collective behavior. Here we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to study the effect of group composition on individual behavior and division of labor (DOL) in a social insect. Experimentally, we use automated behavioral tracking to monitor 120 colonies of the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, with controlled variation in three key correlates of social insect behavior: genotype, age, and morphology. We find that each of these sources of heterogeneity generates a distinct pattern of behavioral organization, including the amplification or dampening of inherent behavioral differences in colonies with mixed types. Theoretically, we use a well-studied model of DOL to explore potential mechanisms underlying the experimental findings. We find that the simplest implementation of this model, which assumes that heterogeneous individuals differ only in response thresholds, could only partially recapitulate the empirically observed patterns of behavior. However, the full spectrum of observed phenomena was recapitulated by extending the model to incorporate two factors that are biologically meaningful but theoretically rarely considered: variation among workers in task performance efficiency and among larvae in task demand. Our results thus show that different sources of heterogeneity within social groups can generate different, sometimes non-intuitive, behavioral effects, but that relatively simple models can capture these dynamics and thereby begin to elucidate the basic organizational principles of DOL in social insects.Significance Statement When individuals interact in an aggregate, many factors that are not known a priori affect group dynamics. A social group will therefore show emergent properties that cannot easily be predicted from how its members behave in isolation. This problem is exacerbated in mixed groups, where different individuals have different behavioral tendencies. Here we describe different facets of collective behavioral organization in mixed groups of the clonal raider ant, and show that a simple theoretical model can capture even non-intuitive aspects of the behavioral data. These results begin to reveal the principles underlying emergent behavioral organization in social insects. Importantly, our insights might apply to complex biological systems more generally and be used to help engineer collective behavior in artificial systems.",2130,406,751,30.0

Recent imaging data demonstrate the existence of scene-sensitive areas in the dorsal visual path that are likely to combine visual information from successive egocentric views, while behavioral evidence indicates the memory of surrounding visual space in extraretinal coordinates. The present work focuses on the computational nature of a panoramic representation that is proposed to link visual and mnemonic functions during natural behavior. In a spiking neural network model of the dorsal visual path it is shown how time-integration of spatial views can give rise to such a representation and how it can subsequently be used to perform memory-based spatial reorientation and visual search.

However, it is mysterious that how the undertakers distinguish death and life instantly. Through integrative studies of behavioural tests and chemical analyses, a novel mechanism for dead conspecifics recognition is found in the Asian bee Apis cerana cerana Fabricius. The bees detect quickly the death of conspecifics based on decreased cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) emissions, caused by the cooling of the dead bee. Specifically, with the decline of body temperature in death, the CHC emission was reduced. Undertakers perceived the major CHCs. Addition of synthetic CHCs, followed by heating, inhibited undertaking behaviour. Among these CHCs, heptacosane and nonacosane are the major compounds in a natural bee hive, providing a continuous signal associated with life. Via changing the vapour pressure then the ratio of emitted compounds encoding the physiological status of signal sender, insect chemical communication can be finely tuned by body temperature. This straightforward death recognition mechanism requiring little cost can be universal in animal living in social groups, especially in the social insects. Body temperature affected behaviour can response to increasing frequency of extreme weathers in global climate change, which help explain the recent worldwide bee health problem.",1312,3823,504,26.0

However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying vision problems in patients with homocystinuria are little understood.Materials and Methods The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a useful experimental system to investigate the genetic basis of several human diseases, but no study to date has used Drosophila as model of homocystinuria. Here we use genetic tools to down-regulate CBS and classical behavioral assays to propose Drosophila as a model of homocystinuria to study vision problems.Results We present evidence that CBS-deficient flies show an abnormal stereotypical behavior of attraction towards a luminous source or phototaxis, consistent with severe myopia in humans. We show that this behavior cannot be fully attributed to a motor or olfactory deficiency but most likely to an impaired vision. CBS-deficient flies are overall smaller, but smaller eyes do not explain their erratic phototactic response.Conclusions We propose Drosophila as a useful model to investigate ocular manifestations underlying homocystinuria.",570,48,189,11.0

This search behavior forms continuously expanding, non-oriented loops that are centered near the point of search initiation. The radius of this search is apparently scaled to the animal’s accumulated error during path integration, improving the effectiveness of the search.

However, the role of randomness or unpredictability in animal movements is not very well understood. In the present study, we used a theoretical framework to explore the advantage of Lévy walks in terms of avoidance behaviour in prey-predator interactions and analysed the conditions for maximising the prey’s survival rate. We showed that there is a trade-off relationship between the predictability of the prey’s movement and the length of time of exposure to predation risk, suggesting that it is difficult for prey to decrease both parameters in order to survive. Then, we demonstrated that the optimal degree of randomness in avoidance behaviour could change depending on the predator’s ability. In particular, Lévy walks resulted in higher survival rates than normal random walks and straight movements when the physical ability of the predators was high. This indicates that the advantage of Lévy walks may also be present in random avoidance behaviour and provides new insights into why Lévy walks can evolve in terms of randomness.",716,188,238,16.0

The cause of these drastic behavioural changes could be manipulation factors released by the parasite in its environment (the secretome), but this has rarely been assessed. We studied a non-cerebral parasite, the cestode Schistocephalus solidus, and its intermediate host, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), whose response to danger becomes significantly diminished when infected. These altered behaviours appear only during late infection, when the worm is ready to reproduce in its final avian host. Sympatric host-parasite pairs show higher infection success for parasites, suggesting that the secretome effects could differ for allopatric host-parasite pairs with independent evolutionary histories. We tested the effects of secretome exposure on behaviour by using secretions from the early and late infection of S. solidus and by injecting them in healthy sticklebacks from a sympatric and allopatric population. Contrary to our prediction, secretome from late infection worms did not result in more risky behaviours, but secretome from early infection resulted in more cautious hosts, only in fish from the allopatric population. Our results suggest that the secretome of Schistocephalus solidus contains molecules that can affect host behaviour, that the causes underlying the behavioural changes in infected sticklebacks are multifactorial, and that local adaptation between host-parasite pairs may extend to the response to the parasite’s secretome content.",1272,246,397,28.0

Preclinical models provide an ideal opportunity to evaluate mechanisms underlying opioid withdrawal. Current models are limited by their reliance upon forced opioid administration, focus on the acute (and not protracted) syndrome, and exclusion of females. In this study, male and female rats self-administered heroin (maintenance dose of 12.5 μg/kg/infusion) opioid withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation was measured. In Phase 1, acute withdrawal symptoms were rated in male and female rats at 0, 16, 48, and 72 hrs following the last self-administration session. Total somatic signs increased until 48 hrs (predominantly in females), and heroin intake positively correlated with total somatic signs at the 48 and 72 hr timepoints. Measures of hyperactivity and anxiety-like behavior increased by 16 and 48 hrs, respectively. In Phase 2, symptoms were assessed at baseline, acute, and protracted (168 and 312 hrs after self-administration) timepoints in a subset of male and female rats from Phase 1. The total number of somatic signs did not differ across timepoints, though females displayed significantly higher body temperature at all timepoints compared to males, indicating sex-specific protracted withdrawal symptomatology. These data provide a thorough characterization of rodent opioid withdrawal symptomatology following self-administration and abrupt discontinuation that serve as a foundation for future studies designed to mimic the human experience, and demonstrate the importance of characterizing acute and protracted withdrawal with sex-specificity in preclinical models of opioid self-administration.",713,371,310,36.0

However, the proximate and ultimate causes of personality trait change are largely unknown, especially in adults. In a controlled, longitudinal experiment, we tested whether a key life event for adults – mating – can cause personality traits to change in female threespine sticklebacks. We confirmed that there are consistent individual differences in activity, sociability and risk taking, and then compared these personality traits among three groups of females: 1) control females; 2) females that physically mated; 3) females that socially experienced courtship but did not mate. Both the physical experience of mating and the social experience of courtship caused females to become less willing to take risks and less social. To understand the proximate mechanisms underlying these changes, we measured levels of excreted steroids. Both the physical experience of mating and the social experience of courtship caused levels of dihydroxyprogesterone (17α,20β-P) to increase, and females with higher 17α,20β-P were less willing to take risks and less social.

In the present study, we focus on locomotion of the sturgeon, an extant primitive fish, as a new experimental model, to investigate behavioural plasticity. Their locomotion in low-water-level conditions was similar to an escape response in water, the C-start escape response, which is used by most fish and amphibian juveniles to avoid predation. Sturgeons were also found to have mastered rolling-over in response to low water levels, resulting in the improvement of their trunk-twisting action. Sturgeons acquired an efficient shift in their centroid, thereby improving their mobility.

Because of the fluid “fission-fusion” nature of their relationships: individuals foraging, traveling, and socializing with a number of animals, where associations form and are broken numerous times, little has been confirmed about their long-term associations. Humpback whales of the North Pacific Ocean migrate annually between tropical breeding areas to northern latitudes where they congregate and feed. The purpose of this study was to explore the social and feeding habits of the summer population of humpback whales returning to Prince William Sound (PWS) in the south central coast of Alaska. Fluke photographs of pigmentation patterns were used to document individual whales between the years 1983 and 2009 to determine, population characteristics, reproductive rates, long-term associations, feeding habits and spatial partitioning. During the 27 year study period there were 3,017 encounters with 405 unique whales. Forty of these whales (9.88%) had long sighting histories, showing strong site fidelity. Association indices for all pairs of whales were calculated. Long-lasting associations were found between thirty-two of the forty whales. Two distinct groups were determined by the highest association coefficients. Although the overall ranges of the two groups overlapped, they did not often mingle and offspring did not join their maternal group. All but two females had enduring bonds with at least one male. Associate males were sometimes found at a distance from others of their “clan” and would rejoin periodically. Two whales from one of these clans were found together in Hawaiian waters, a male escorting a female with a newborn calf, suggesting these long lasting associations endure through migration and into the southern breeding areas.

Farine, Coretta Jongeling, Lysanne Snijders",785345;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/785345,"Social relationships can have important fitness consequences. Although there is increasing evidence that social relationships carry over across contexts, few studies have investigated whether relationships formed early in life are carried over to adulthood. For example, juveniles of monogamous species go through a major life-history stage transition—pair formation—during which the pair bond becomes a central unit of the social organization. At present, it remains unclear if pair members retain their early-life relationships after pair formation. We investigated whether same-sex associations formed early in life carry over into adulthood and whether carry-over was dependent on season, in a monogamous species. Moreover, we investigated the role of familiarity, genetic relatedness and aggression on the perseverance of social associations. We studied the social structure before and after pair formation in captive barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), a highly social, long-lived, monogamous species. We constructed association networks of groups of geese before pair formation, during the subsequent breeding season, and in the following wintering season. Next, we studied how these associations carried over during seasonal changes. We found that early-life associations in females were lost during the breeding season, but resurfaced during the subsequent wintering season. In males, the early-life associations persisted across both seasons. Association persistence was not mediated by genetic relatedness or familiarity. The high level of aggressiveness of males, but not females, in the breeding season suggests that males may have played a key role in shaping both their own social environment and that of their partners. We show that early-life social relationships can be maintained well into later life. Such relationships can be sustained even if they are temporarily disrupted, for example due to reproductive behaviour. Our findings therefore highlight that the early-life social environment can have life-long consequences on individuals’ social environment.",919,157,364,34.0

Here we challenged bees with a five-comparison choice task in which five colours differed in their probability of offering reward and punishment. The colours were ranked such that high ranked colours were more likely to offer reward, and the ranking was unambiguous. Bees choices in unrewarded tests matched their individual experiences of reward and punishment of each colour, indicating bees solved this test not by comparing or ranking colours but by matching their preferences to their history of reinforcement for each colour. We used a computational model to explore the feasibility of this probability matching strategy for the honey bee brain. The model suggested a structure like the honey bee mushroom body with reinforcement-related plasticity at both input and output was sufficient for this cognitive strategy.

Evidence for elemental processing comes from findings of summation in animals, where a compound of two stimuli that independently predict an outcome is deemed to be more predictive of the outcome than each stimulus alone. Configural processing, on the other hand, is supported by experiments that fail to find this effect when the compound is comprised of similar stimuli. In humans, by contrast, summation seems to be robust and independent of similarity. We show how these results are best explained by an alternative view in which generalization comes about from a visual search process in which subjects process the most predictive or salient stimulus in a compound. We offer empirical support for this theory in three human experiments on causal learning and formalize a new elemental visual search model based on reinforcement learning principles which can capture the present and previous data on generalization, bridging two different research areas in psychology into a unitary framework.",1494,248,405,52.0

Quantifying intra- and inter-individual variability of behavior, or individual behavioral type, appears to be a prerequisite in the study of animal personality. We propose a statistical method from a predictive point of view to measure the appropriateness of our assumption of ‘individual’ behavior in repeatedly measured behavioral data from several individuals. For a model case, we studied the sponge crab Lauridromia dehaani known to make and carry a ‘cap’ from a natural sponge for camouflage. Because a cap is most likely to be rebuilt and replaced repeatedly, we hypothesized that each individual crab would grow a unique behavioral type and it would be observed under an experimentally controlled environmental condition. To test the hypothesis, we conducted behavioral experiments and employed a new Bayesian model-based comparison method to examine whether crabs have individual behavioral types in the cap making behavior. Crabs were given behavioral choices by using artificial sponges of three different sizes. We modeled the choice of sponges, size of the trimmed part of a cap, size of the cavity of a cap, and the latency to produce a cap, as random variables in 26 models, including hierarchical models specifying the behavioral types. In addition, we calculated the marginal-level widely applicable information criterion (mWAIC) values for hierarchical models to evaluate and compared them with the non-hierarchical models from the predictive point of view. As a result, the crabs of less than about 9 cm in size were found to make caps from the sponges. The body size explained the behavioral variables namely, choice, trimmed cap characteristics, and cavity size, but not latency. Furthermore, we captured the behavioral type as a probabilistic distribution structure of the behavioral data by comparing WAIC. Our statistical approach is not limited to behavioral data but is also applicable to physiological or morphological data when examining whether some group structure exists behind fluctuating empirical data.",6600,936,1279,26.0

Nonetheless, there remain challenges around ease of use for large scale in situ recordings and extracting data reliably in the critical areas of the bednet where the optical signal is attenuated. Here we introduce a retro-reflective screen at the back of the measurement volume, which can simultaneously provide diffuse illumination, and remove optical alignment issues whilst requiring only one-sided access to the measurement space. The illumination becomes significantly more uniform, although, noise removal algorithms are needed to reduce the effects of shot noise particularly across low intensity bednet regions. By systematically introducing mosquitoes in front and behind the bednet in lab experiments we are able to demonstrate robust tracking in these challenging areas. Overall, the retro-reflective imaging setup delivers mosquito segmentation rates in excess of 90% compared to less than 70% with back-lit systems.",1209,216,433,24.0

In the wild, many animals manipulate their environment to create architectural constructions, which represent a type of extended phenotype affecting survival and/or reproduction, and these behaviors are excellent models of goal-directed decision-making. Here, we describe an automated system for measuring bower construction in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, whereby males construct sand structures to attract mates through the accumulated actions of thousands of individual sand manipulation decisions over the course of many days. The system integrates two orthogonal methods, depth sensing and action recognition, to simultaneously measure the developing bower structure and classify the sand manipulation decisions through which it is constructed. We show that action recognition accurately (&gt;85%) classifies ten sand manipulation behaviors across three different species and distinguishes between scooping and spitting events that occur during bower construction versus feeding. Registration of depth and video data streams enables topographical mapping of these behaviors onto a dynamic 3D sand surface. The hardware required for this setup is inexpensive (&lt;$250 per setup), allowing for the simultaneous recording from many independent aquariums. We further show that bower construction behaviors are non-uniform in time, non-uniform in space, and spatially repeatable across trials. We also quantify a unique behavioral phenotype in interspecies hybrids, wherein males sequentially express both phenotypes of behaviorally-divergent parental species. Our work demonstrates that simultaneously tracking both structure and behavior provides an integrated picture of long-term goal-directed decision-making in a naturalistic, dynamic, and social environment.",1314,270,537,48.0

This topographic representation and the corresponding tuning of cortical cells to object distance suggests the bats may be able to perceptually resolve multiple, simultaneously present objects along the distance axis. Here we use a novel psychophysical paradigm with complex phantom targets to quantity spatial resolution along the distance axis in the echolocating bat Phyllostomus discolor. We show that our bats can indeed perceptually resolve objects along the distance axis when they are separated by about 40 cm (around a reference distance of 108 cm) along the distance axis.

Chorusing birds, for instance, coordinate vocal timing to minimize overlap. Alternatively, other birds may use frequency differences to segregate sound streams, and vocalizing at different frequencies may enable them to remain distinct from each other. Here, I show that conspecific Asian barbets vocalize at distinctly different peak frequencies from each other. Additionally, they also differ in repetition rate, as measured by the inter-phrase interval. However, conspecific individuals across species do not temporally coordinate with each other during vocal interactions, maintaining independent and highly stereotyped individual rhythms together with different peak frequencies. Frequency differences between individuals may facilitate sound stream segregation when calls overlap in time. I propose that frequency differences between conspecifics may be widespread among birds possessing stereotyped, repetitive calls such as those found in barbets.

Many methods for making predictions from such models exist, although these methods either assume that stimuli are static over the course of a trial, or are computationally expensive, making it difficult to capitalise on trial-by-trial variability in dynamic stimuli. Using the framework of the drift diffusion model with time-dependent thresholds, and the idea of a Bayesian confidence readout, we derive expressions for the probability distribution over confidence reports. In line with current models of confidence, the derivations allow for the accumulation of “pipeline” evidence which has been received but not processed by the time of response, the effect of drift rate variability, and metacognitive noise. The expressions are valid for stimuli which change over the course of a trial with normally distributed fluctuations in the evidence they provide. A number of approximations are made to arrive at the final expressions, and we test all approximations via simulation. The derived expressions only contain a small number of standard functions, and only require evaluating once per trial, making trial-by-trial modelling of confidence data in dynamic stimuli tasks more feasible. We conclude by using the expressions to gain insight into the confidence of optimal observers, and empirically observed patterns.",1159,87,484,33.0

If a modest 15% mortality rate is assumed across all mouse strains used in the EU, approximately 1 million more pups must be produced yearly to compensate for those which die. A few environmental and social factors have been identified as affecting pup mortality, but optimizing these factors does not cease the problem. This study is the first large study to mine data records from 219,975 pups from two breeding facilities to determine the major risk factors associated with mouse pre-weaning mortality. It was hypothesized that litter overlap (i.e. the presence of older siblings in the cage when new pups are born), a recurrent social configuration in trio-housed mice, is associated with increased newborn mortality, along with high mother age, large litter size, as well as a high number and age of older siblings in the cage. The estimated probability of pup death was two to seven percentage points higher in cages with compared to those without litter overlap. Litter overlap was associated with an increase in percentage of litter losses of 19% and 103%, respectively, in the two breeding facilities. Increased number and age of older siblings, high mother age, small litter size (less than four pups born) and large litter size (over 11 pups born) were associated with increased probability of pup death. Results suggest that common social cage configurations at breeding facilities are dangerous for the survivability of young mouse pups.

One of the mechanisms regulating the conflicts is policing, a coercive behavior that reduces direct reproduction by other individuals. In eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), workers or the queen act aggressively toward fertile workers, or destroy their eggs. In many termite species (order Blattodea), upon the death of primary queen and king, workers or nymphs can differentiate into neotenic reproductives and inherit the breeding position. During this process, competition among neotenics is inevitable, but how this conflict is resolved remains unclear. Here, we report a policing behavior that regulates reproductive division of labor in the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. Our results demonstrate that the policing behavior is a cooperative effort performed sequentially by successful neotenics and workers. A neotenic reproductive initiates the attack of the fellow neotenic by biting and displays alarm behavior. Workers are then recruited to cannibalize the injured neotenic. Furthermore, the initiation of policing is age-dependent, with older reproductives attacking younger ones, thereby inheriting the reproductive position. This study provides empirical evidence of policing behavior in termites, which represents a convergent trait shared between eusocial Hymenoptera and Blattodea.",1089,96,412,25.0

Using the blocking/unblocking paradigm, we found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional partner reward unblocked associative learning about this cue. In contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring associative value. Preventing social signal exchange between the partners resulted in cues signaling partner reward remaining blocked.

Beyond this level, sexual behavior comprises also post-copulatory interactions among the sexual partners. To investigate whether the presence of genital skin ulcers has an impact at the post-copulatory level, we analyzed 517 copulation events of 32 cycling females and 29 males. The occurrence of post-copulatory behaviors (i.e., copulation calls, darting [female rapid withdraw from the male] and post-copulatory grooming) was not altered by the presence of genital skin ulcerations. Similarly to other baboon populations, females of our group were more likely to utter copulation calls after ejaculatory copulation. The likelihood of darting was higher after ejaculatory copulations and with the presence of copulation calls. Post-copulatory grooming was rarely observed but when it occurred, males groomed females for longer periods when females uttered copulation calls during, or preceding mating. Our results indicate that despite the presence of conspicuous genital skin ulcers, the post-copulatory behavior was not affected by the genital health status of the dyad. This suggests that infection cues play a major role before and during mating but do not affect post-copulatory behavior.",653,66,287,21.0

In New Zealand, endemic host Whiteheads act inconspicuously around their nests in the presence of sympatric Long-tailed Cuckoos, their obligate brood parasite, perhaps to avoid disclosing nest location. We tested behavioral responses of a Whitehead population on Tiritiri Matangi Island that has been breeding allopatrically from cuckoos for 17 years. We presented models of the allopatric parasite, a sympatric predator (Morepork Owl), and a sympatric non-threatening heterospecific (Song Thrush) during the egg and chick stages, and to groups of cooperatively breeding Whiteheads. We compared responses across nest stage and stimulus type. We found that, unlike sympatric Whiteheads elsewhere in New Zealand, Whiteheads on Tiritiri Matangi produced alarm calls in response to the cuckoo model. Furthermore, the rate of alarm calling was similar towards the cuckoo and the owl and across egg and chick stage and higher than to the control stimulus.

There is conflicting evidence about how mice use vision to sample their environment. During head restraint, mice make rapid eye movements strongly coupled between the eyes, similar to conjugate saccadic eye movements in humans. However, when mice are free to move their heads, eye movement patterns are more complex and often non-conjugate, with the eyes moving in opposite directions. Here, we combined eye tracking with head motion measurements in freely moving mice and found that both observations can be explained by the existence of two distinct types of coupling between eye and head movements. The first type comprised non-conjugate eye movements which systematically compensated for changes in head tilt to maintain approximately the same visual field relative to the horizontal ground plane. The second type of eye movements were conjugate and coupled to head yaw rotation to produce a “saccade and fixate” gaze pattern. During head initiated saccades, the eyes moved together in the same direction as the head, but during subsequent fixation moved in the opposite direction to the head to compensate for head rotation. This “saccade and fixate” pattern is similar to that seen in humans who use eye movements (with or without head movement) to rapidly shift gaze but in mice relies on combined eye and head movements. Indeed, the two types of eye movements very rarely occurred in the absence of head movements. Even in head-restrained mice, eye movements were invariably associated with attempted head motion. Both types of eye-head coupling were seen in freely moving mice during social interactions and a visually-guided object tracking task.

Dogs (Canis familiaris) have the ability to form lasting attachment, a social bond based on emotional dependency, with humans and it has specifically been suggested that this ability evolved post-domestication in dogs. Subsequently, it is expected that dogs but not wolves (Canis lupus), can develop attachment bonds to humans. However, while it has been shown that 16-weeks-old wolves do not discriminate in their expression of attachment behaviour toward a human caregiver and a stranger when compared to similar aged dogs, wolves at the age of eight weeks do. This highlights the potential for wolves to form attachment to humans, but simultaneously raises the question if this attachment weakens over time in wolves compared to dogs. Here we used the Strange Situation Test (SST) to investigate attachment behaviour expressed in hand-reared wolves and dogs toward a human caregiver at the age of 23 weeks. Both wolves and dogs expressed attachment toward a human caregiver. Surprisingly, wolves, but not dogs, discriminated between the caregiver and a stranger by exploring the room more in the presence of the caregiver compared to the stranger and greeting the caregiver more than the stranger.

We evaluated this hypothesis by measuring the autonomic pupil response of eight monkeys across two laboratories in two different versions of a vicarious reinforcement paradigm. Monkeys were cued as to whether an upcoming reward would be delivered to them, another monkey, or nobody and could accept or decline the offer. As expected, all monkeys in both laboratories showed a marked preference for juice to the self, together with a reliable prosocial preference for juice to a social partner compared to juice to nobody. However, contrary to the autonomic arousal hypothesis, we found that pupils were widest in anticipation of juice to the self, moderately-sized in anticipation of juice to nobody, and narrowest in anticipation of juice to a social partner. This effect was seen across both laboratories and regardless of specific task parameters. The seemingly paradoxical pupil effect can be explained by a model in which pupil size tracks outcome salience, prosocial tendencies track outcome valence, and the relation between salience and valence is U-shaped.",1215,120,293,25.0

Complex communication systems are predominantly multimodal and combine modulatory and information bearing signals. The honey bee waggle dance, one of the most elaborate forms of communication in invertebrates, stimulates nestmates to search for food and communicates symbolic information about the location of the food source. Previous studies on the dance behaviour in diverse honey bee species demonstrated distinct differences in the combination of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile signals produced by the dancer. We now studied the behaviour of the receivers of the dance signals, the dance followers, to explore the significance of the different signals in the communication process. In particular, we ask whether there are differences in the behaviour of dance followers between the 3 major Asian honey bee species, A. florea, A. dorsata and A. cerana, and whether these might correlate with the differences in the signals produced by the dancing foragers. Our comparison demonstrates that the behaviour of the dance followers is highly conserved across all 3 species despite the differences in the dance signals. The highest number of followers was present lateral to the dancer throughout the waggle run, and the mean body orientation of the dance followers with respect to the waggle dancer was close to 90° throughout the run for all 3 species. These findings suggest that dance communication might be more conserved than implied by the differences in the signals produced by the dancer. Along with studies in A. mellifera, our results indicate that all honey bee species rely on tactile contacts between the dancer and follower to communicate spatial information. The cues and signals that differ between the species may be involved in attracting the followers towards the dancer in the different nest environments.",1758,430,676,21.0

We investigated whether object memories affect appearance by testing whether blurry borders appear sharper when they are contours of well-known objects versus matched novel objects. Participants viewed blurry versions of one familiar and one novel stimulus simultaneously for 180ms; then made comparative (Exp. 1) or equality judgments regarding perceived blur (Exps. 2-4). For equivalent levels of blur, the borders of well-known objects appeared sharper than those of novel objects.

Here we describe the subtle behavioral features associated with continued seeking for alcohol despite aversive consequences. We developed an automated runway apparatus to measure how Drosophila respond to consecutive exposures of a volatilized substance. Behavior within this Behavioral Expression of Ethanol Reinforcement Runway (BEER Run) demonstrated a defined shift from aversive to appetitive responses to volatilized ethanol. Behavioral metrics attained by combining computer vision and machine learning methods, reveal that a subset of 9 classified behaviors and component behavioral features associate with this shift. We propose this combination of 9 behaviors can be used to navigate the complexities of operant learning to reveal motivated goal-seeking behavior.",1526,141,454,11.0

According to these inconclusive and puzzling findings, the scientific community has yet to reach an agreement concerning the underlying mechanism behind animal magnetic sensing. Recently, the symbiotic magnetotaxis hypothesis has been forwarded as a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of animal magnetoreception. It suggests a symbiotic relationship between magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) and the navigating host.

Rothkopf",2020.02.14.949164;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.949164,"While interacting with objects during every-day activities, e.g. when sliding a glass on a counter top, people obtain constant feedback whether they are acting in accordance with physical laws. However, classical research on intuitive physics has revealed that people’s judgements systematically deviate from predictions of Newtonian physics. Recent research has explained these deviations not as consequence of misconceptions about physics but instead as the consequence of the probabilistic interaction between inevitable perceptual uncertainties and prior beliefs. How intuitive physical reasoning relates to visuomotor actions is much less known. Here, we present an experiment in which participants had to slide pucks under the influence of naturalistic friction in a simulated virtual environment. The puck was controlled by the duration of a button press, which needed to be scaled linearly with the puck’s mass and with the square-root of initial distance to reach a target. Over four phases of the experiment, uncertainties were manipulated by altering the availability of sensory feedback and providing different degrees of knowledge about the physical properties of pucks. A hierarchical Bayesian model of the visuomotor sliding task incorporating perceptual uncertainty and press-time variability found substantial evidence that subjects adjusted their button-presses so that the sliding was in accordance with Newtonian physics. After observing collisions between pucks, subjects transferred the relative masses inferred perceptually to adjust subsequent sliding actions. Crucial in the modeling was the inclusion of a cost function, which quantitatively captures participants’ implicit sensitivity to errors due to their motor variability. Taken together, in the present experiment we find evidence that our participants transferred their intuitive physical reasoning to a subsequent visuomotor control task in accordance with Newtonian physics and weigh potential outcomes with cost functions based on their knowledge about their own variability.Author summary During our daily lives we interact with objects around us governed by Newtonian physics. While people are known to show multiple systematic errors when reasoning about Newtonian physics, recent research has provided evidence that this is the consequence of perceptual uncertainties and partial knowledge about object properties. Here, we carried out an experiment to investigate whether people transfer their intuitive physical reasoning to how they interact with objects. Using a simulated virtual environment in which participants had to slide different pucks into a target region by the length of a button press, we found evidence that they could do so in accordance with the underlying physical laws. Moreover, our participants watched movies of colliding pucks and subsequently transferred their beliefs about the relative masses of the observed pucks to the sliding task. Remarkably, this transfer was consistent with Newtonian physics and could well be explained by a computational model that takes participants’ perceptual uncertainty, action variability, and preferences into account.",1103,144,402,32.0

This indicates that the migratory butterflies also attend to the panorama to guide their travels. Here we studied if non-migrating butterflies - that stay in a more restricted area to feed and breed - also use a similar compass system to guide their flights. Performing behavioral experiments on tethered flying butterflies in an indoor LED flight simulator, we found that the monarchs fly along straight tracks with respect to a simulated sun. When a panoramic skyline was presented as the only orientation cue, the butterflies maintained their flight direction only during short sequences suggesting that they potentially use it for flight stabilization. We further found that when we presented the two cues together, the butterflies register both cues in their compass. Taken together, we here show that non-migrating monarch butterflies can combine multiple visual cues for robust orientation, an ability that may also aid them during their migration.Summary Non-migrating butterflies keep directed courses when viewing a simulated sun or panoramic scene.

The physiological mechanisms underlying aggression have mostly been examined in breeding males, in which gonadal androgens, acting in part through their aromatization to estrogens, have a key role. There are two alternative models that contribute to further understanding hormonal mechanisms underlying aggression: aggression displayed in the non-breeding season, when gonadal steroids are low, and female aggression. In this study we approach, for the first time, the modulatory role of estrogens and androgens upon non-breeding aggression in a wild female teleost fish. We characterized female aggression in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum and carried out acute treatments 1 h prior to agonistic encounters with either an aromatase inhibitor or an antagonist of androgen receptors. Aromatase inhibition caused a strong distortion of aggressive behavior whereas anti-androgen treatment had no effect on behavior. Territorial non-breeding aggression in female G. omarorum is robust and depended on rapid estrogen actions to maintain high levels of aggression, and ultimately reach conflict resolution from which dominant/subordinate status emerged. Our results taken together with our own reports in males and the contributions from non-breeding aggression in bird and mammal models, suggest a conserved strategy involving fast-acting estrogens in the control of this behavior across species. In addition, further analysis of female non-breeding aggression may shed light on potential sexual differences in the fine tuning of social behaviors.HighlightsFemale Gymnotus omarorum displayed robust territorial aggression in lab settings.Acute treatment with aromatase inhibitor lowered aggression levels.Aromatase inhibition increased first attack latency and decreased conflict resolution.Acute treatment with anti-androgens showed no effects.This is the first report of estrogens underlying teleost non-breeding female aggression.",711,194,237,24.0

Winners of intrasexual contests often garner considerable fitness benefits, through greater access to mates, food, or social dominance. In females, aggression is often tightly linked to reproduction, with females displaying increases in aggressive behavior when mated, gestating or lactating, or when protecting dependent offspring. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, females spend twice as long fighting over food after mating as when they are virgins. However, it is unknown when this increase in aggression begins or whether it is consistent across genotypes. Here we show that aggression in females increases between 2 to 4 hours after mating and remains elevated for at least a week after a single mating. In addition, this increase in aggression 24 hours after mating is consistent across three diverse genotypes, suggesting this may be a universal response to mating in the species. We also report here the first use of automated tracking and classification software to study female aggression in Drosophila and assess its accuracy for this behavior.

Swimming is exercise for C. elegans and here we suggest that inactive bouts are a recovery state akin to fatigue. Previously, analysis of exercise-induced quiescent (EIQ) bouts relied on laborious manual observation, as existing automated analysis methods for C. elegans swimming either cannot analyze EIQ bouts or fail to accurately track animal posture during these bouts. It is known that cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) activity plays a conserved role in sleep, rest, and arousal. Using C. elegans EGL-4 PKG, we first validate a novel learning-based computer vision approach to automatically analyze C. elegans locomotory behavior and distinguish between activity and inactivity during swimming for long periods of time. We find that C. elegans EGL-4 PKG function predicts EIQ first bout timing, fractional quiescence, bout number, and bout duration, suggesting that previously described pathways are engaged during EIQ bouts. However, EIQ bouts are likely not sleep as animals are feeding during the majority of EIQ bouts. We find that genetic perturbation of neurons required for other C. elegans sleep states also does not alter EIQ dynamics. Additionally, we find that EIQ onset is sensitive to age and DAF-16 FOXO function. In summary, we have validated a new behavioral analysis software that enabled a quantitative and detailed assessment of swimming behavior, including EIQ. We found novel EIQ defects in aged animals and animals with mutations in a gene involved in stress tolerance. We anticipate that further use of this software will facilitate the analysis of genes and pathways critical for fatigue and other C. elegans behaviors.",1525,209,407,35.0

Only recently have there been attempts to model the cognitive processes whereby people learn – and track – non-stationary probabilities, reviving the old debate on whether learning occurs trial-by-trial or by occasional shifts between discrete hypotheses. Trial-by-trial updating models – such as the delta-rule model – have been popular in describing human learning in various contexts, but it has been argued that they are inadequate for explaining how humans update beliefs about non-stationary probabilities. Specifically, it has been claimed that these models cannot account for the discrete, stepwise updating that characterises response patterns in experiments where participants tracked a non-stationary probability based on observed outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that the rejection of trial-by-trial models was premature for two reasons. First, our experimental data suggest that the stepwise behaviour depends on details of the experimental paradigm. Hence, discreteness in response data does not necessarily imply discreteness in internal belief updating. Second, previous studies have dismissed trial-by-trial models mainly based on qualitative arguments rather than quantitative model comparison. To evaluate the models more rigorously, we performed a likelihood-based model comparison between stepwise and trial-by-trial updating models. Across eight datasets collected in three different labs, human behaviour is consistently best described by trial-by-trial updating models. Our results suggest that trial-by-trial updating plays a prominent role in the cognitive processes underlying learning of non-stationary probabilities.",1306,219,400,50.0

We first developed an on-lattice minimal model for comparing collective and solitary foraging strategies, finding that social agents benefit from feeding faster and more efficiently simply due to group formation. Our laboratory foraging experiments with npr-1 and N2 worm populations, however, show an advantage for solitary N2 in all food distribution environments that we tested. We incorporated additional strain-specific behavioural parameters of npr-1 and N2 worms into our model and computationally identified N2’s higher feeding rate to be the key factor underlying its advantage, without which it is possible to recapitulate the advantage of collective foraging in patchy environments.

In one session, one of the three daily meals was presented as breakfast whereas in the other session, a nutritionally equivalent meal was presented as a late-evening snack. The duration of the overnight fast was the same for both sessions. Whereas the two sessions did not differ in overall energy expenditure, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was different during sleep between the two sessions. Unexpectedly, this difference in RER due to daily meal timing was not due to daily differences in physical activity, sleep disruption, or core body temperature. Rather, we found that the daily timing of nutrient availability coupled with daily/circadian control of metabolism drives a switch in substrate preference such that the late-evening snack session resulted in significantly lower lipid oxidation compared to the breakfast session. Therefore, the timing of meals during the day/night cycle affects how ingested food is oxidized or stored in humans with important implications for optimal eating habits.",1188,265,367,24.0

In this study, we focused on the seasonal variation of the determinants of territory size in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum. This species is a seasonal breeder that displays year-long territorial aggression, in which female and male dyads exhibit indistinguishable non-breeding territorial agonistic behavior and the only significant predictor of contest outcome is body size. We carried out field surveys across seasons that included the identification of individual location, measurements of water physico-chemical variables, characterization of individual morphometric and physiological traits, and their correlation to spatial distribution. Although Gymnotus omarorum tolerates a wide range of dissolved oxygen concentration, territory size correlated with dissolved oxygen in both seasons. In the non-breeding season, we show that territory size is sexually monomorphic and explained only by body size. In the breeding season, while body size no longer correlated with territory size, evidence of sexual differences in territory size determinants emerged. First, the overall spatial arrangement adopted a sexual bias. Second, territory size depended on gonadal hormones in both sexes, which was expected for males, but not previously reported in females. Third, females’ territory size correlated with gonadal size and females showed relatively larger territories than males, probably to meet sexually dimorphic energetic requirements. This study provides evidence of seasonal changes in factors correlated with territory size and contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity.",905,95,205,32.0

However, a comparison of the word-to-word structural organization of dream reports is lacking, and traditional measures that distinguish REM and non-REM dreaming may be confounded by report length. This problem is amenable to the analysis of dream reports as non-semantic directed word graphs, which provide a structural assessment of oral reports, while controlling for individual differences in verbosity. Against this background, the present study had two main aims: Firstly, to investigate differences in graph structure between REM and non-REM dream reports, and secondly, to evaluate how non-semantic directed word graph analysis compares to the widely used measure of report length in dream analysis. To do this, we analyzed a set of 125 dream reports obtained from 19 participants in controlled laboratory awakenings from REM and N2 sleep. We found that: (1) graphs from REM sleep possess a larger connectedness compared to those from N2; (2) measures of graph structure can predict ratings of dream complexity, where increases in connectedness and decreases in randomness are observed in relation to increasing dream report complexity; and (3) measures of the Largest Connected Component of a graph can improve a model containing report length in predicting sleep stage and dream complexity. These results indicate that dream reports sampled after REM awakening have on average a larger connectedness compared to those sampled after N2 (i.e. words recur with a longer range), a difference which appears to be related to underlying differences in dream complexity. Altogether, graph analysis represents a promising method for dream research, due to its automated nature and potential to complement report length in dream analysis.",1528,1734,520,40.0

Alternative splicing of PAC1 results in multiple gene products, which differ in their mode of signalling and tissue distribution. However, the roles of distinct splice variants in the regulation of stress behavior is poorly understood. Alternative splicing of a short exon, which is known as the “hop cassette”, occurs during brain development and in response to stressful challenges. To examine the function of this variant, we generated a splice-specific zebrafish mutant lacking the hop cassette, which we designated ‘hopless’. We show that hopless mutant larvae display increased anxiety-like behavior, including reduced dark exploration and impaired habituation to dark exposure. Conversely, adult hopless mutants displayed superior ability to rebound from an acute stressor, as they exhibited reduced anxiety- like responses to an ensuing novelty stress. We propose that the developmental loss of a specific PAC1 splice variant mimics prolonged mild stress exposure, which in the long term, predisposes the organism’s stress response towards a resilient phenotype. Our study presents a unique genetic model demonstrating how early-life state of anxiety paradoxically correlates with reduced stress susceptibility in adulthood.",1186,188,291,31.0

Even after accounting for the allometric effect of body size, substantial variation in brain size still remains unexplained. A plausible advantage of a disproportionately larger brain might be an enhanced ability to learn new behaviors to cope with novel or complex challenges. While this hypothesis has received ample support from studies in birds and mammals, similar evidence is not available for small-brained animals like insects. Our objective is to compare the learning abilities of different bee species with their brain size investment. We conducted an experiment in which field-collected individuals had to associate an unconditioned stimulus (sucrose), with a conditioned stimulus (colored strip). We show that the probability of learning the reward-colour association was related to both absolute and relative brain size. This study shows that other bee species aside from the long studied honeybees and bumblebees, can be used in cognitive experiments and opens the door to explore the importance of relative brain sizes in cognitive tasks for insects and its consequences for species survival in a changing world.",2019,603,484,23.0

Not all experiences are remembered equally well nor for equally long. It has been demonstrated experimentally in humans that memory strength positively depends on the behavioral relevance of the associated experience. Behavioral paradigms testing the selective retention of memory in rodents would enable to further investigate the neuronal mechanisms at play. We developed a novel paradigm to follow the repeated acquisition and retrieval of two contextually distinct, yet concurrently occurring, food-place associations in rats. We demonstrated the use of this paradigm by varying the amount of reward associated with the two locations. After delays of 2h or 20h, rats showed better memory performance for experiences associated with larger amount of reward. This effect depends on the level of spatial integration required to retrieve the associated location. Thus, this paradigm is suited to study the preferential retention of relevant experiences in rats.",687,154,181,19.0

We present here a set of computational methods that center around projecting animal vocalizations into low dimensional latent representational spaces that are directly learned from data. We apply these methods to diverse datasets from over 20 species, including humans, bats, songbirds, mice, cetaceans, and nonhuman primates, enabling high-powered comparative analyses of unbiased acoustic features in the communicative repertoires across species. Latent projections uncover complex features of data in visually intuitive and quantifiable ways. We introduce methods for analyzing vocalizations as both discrete sequences and as continuous latent variables.

However, most network-level neuroimaging employs static measures of resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), assuming time-invariance, and unable to capture dynamic brain-behavior relationships. Recent advances in rsFC signal processing allow characterization of “time varying connectivity” (TVC), which characterizes network communication between sub-networks that reconfigure over the course of data collection. As such, TVC may more fully describe network dysfunction related to the NWS.Methods To isolate alterations in the frequency and diversity of communication across network boundaries as a function of acute nicotine abstinence we scanned cigarette smokers in the nicotine sated and abstinent states and applied a previously-validated method to characterize TVC at a network and nodal level within the brain.Results During abstinence, we found brain wide decreases in the frequency of interactions between network nodes in different modular communities (i.e. temporal flexibility; TF). In addition, within a subset of the networks examined the variability of these interactions across community boundaries (i.e. spatiotemporal diversity; STD) also decreased. Finally, within two of these networks the decrease in STD was significantly related to NWS clinical symptoms.Conclusions Employing multiple measures of TVC in a within subjects’ design, we characterized a novel set of changes in network communication and link these changes to specific behavioral symptoms of the NWS. These reductions in TVC provide a meso-scale network description of the relative inflexibility of specific large-scale brain networks as a result of acute abstinence.",1023,250,306,29.0

Associations may occur simply because of shared habitat preferences; however, social ties may also be influenced by genetic relatedness (kinship) or social attraction. Here, we investigate the association patterns of wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar using behavioural, spatial (home range), and genetic data from twenty-four individually identified animals. We collected 40,840 records of group composition over a 17-month period and from this calculated pairwise association indices. We also used ranging coordinates and genetic samples to estimate patterns of spatial overlap and kinship, and then related these measures to patterns of affiliation. From these analyses, we found that dyadic ruffed lemur social associations were generally sparse and weak; that home range overlap was minimal; and that average relatedness within the community was low. We found no evidence that kinship was related to patterns of either spatial overlap or social association; instead, associations were primarily driven by space use. Moreover, social preferences were unrelated to kinship. While home range overlap explained most of the variation seen in social association, some variation remains unaccounted for, suggesting that other social, ecological, and biological factors such as shared resource defense or communal breeding might also play a role in social attraction. Our results further highlight the need to consider individual space use and nuances of species behavior when investigating social preference and social association more generally.",1169,290,403,41.0

We rigorously tested this hypothesis using multiple experiments and multiple computational models. We obtained strong evidence that people deviated from the objectively rational strategy when potential losses were large.

Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by providing accurate tracking of animals, yet they often struggle with the analysis of ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to adapt to variable testing environments. In the last couple of years, substantial advances in deep learning and machine vision have given researchers the ability to take behavioral analysis entirely into their own hands. Here, we directly compare the performance of commercially available platforms (Ethovision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. To this end, we provide a set of videos - carefully annotated by several human raters - of three widely used behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we show that by combining deep learning-based motion tracking (DeepLabCut) with simple post-analysis, we can track animals in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or even greater accuracy than commercial behavioral solutions. In addition, we integrate the tracking data from DeepLabCut with post analysis supervised machine learning approaches. This combination allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, thus outperforming commercial solutions. Moreover, the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.",6054,1060,2703,20.0

We used such quantified behavioral parameters to create a novel virtual testing model, capable of accurately simulating indoor flight behavior by a virtual population of host-seeking mosquitoes as it interacts with and responds to simulated stimuli from a human-occupied bed net. We describe the model, including base mosquito behavior, state transitions, environmental representation and host stimulus representation. In the absence of a bed net and human bait, flight distribution of the model population is relatively uniform in the arena. Introducing an unbaited net induces a change in distribution due to landing events on the net surface, predominantly occurring on the sides and edges of the net. Presence of simulated human baited net strongly impacted flight distribution patterns, exploratory foraging, the number and distribution of net landing sites, depending on the bait orientation. As recorded in live mosquito experiments, contact with baited nets (a measure of exposure to the lethal insecticide) occurred predominantly on the top surface of the net. Number of net contacts and height of contacts decreased with increasing attractant dispersal noise. Results generated by the model are an accurate representation of actual mosquito behavior recorded at and around a human-occupied bed net in untreated and insecticide treated nets. In addition to providing insights into host-seeking behavior of endophilic vectors, this fine-grained model is highly flexible and has significant potential for in silico screening of novel bed net designs, accelerating the deployment of new and more effective tools for protecting against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.",1094,441,384,21.0

Such capacity limits have been attributed to a variety of processes including perception, memory encoding, memory storage, memory retrieval, comparison and decision. In this study, we investigated the locus of the effect of increasing set size from 1 to 2. To measure purely attentional effects and not other phenomena such as crowding, a precue was used to manipulate relevant set size and keep the display constant across conditions. The task was to detect a change in the orientation of 1 or 2 Gabor patterns. The locus of the capacity limits was determined by varying when observers were cued to the only stimulus that was relevant. We began by measuring the baseline set-size effect in an initial experiment. In the next experiment, a 100% valid postcue was added to test for an effect of decision. This postcue did not change the set-size effects. In the critical experiments, a 100% valid cue was provided during the retention interval between displays, or only one stimulus was presented in the second display (local recognition). For both of these conditions, there was little or no set-size effect. This pattern of results was found for both hard-to-discriminate stimuli typical of perception experiments and easy-to-discriminate stimuli typical of memory experiments.

In young animals, such sequences may be poorly coordinated, but with age and experience, behaviour progressively adapts to efficiently exploit the animal’s ecological niche. How experience impinges on the developing neural circuits of behaviour is an open question. As a model system, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) hold enormous potential for studying both the development of behaviour and the underlying circuits, but no relevant experience-dependent learning paradigm has yet been characterized. To address this, we have conducted a detailed study of the effects of experience on the ontogeny of hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish. We report that larvae with prior prey experience consume considerably more prey than naive larvae. This is mainly due to increased capture success that is also accompanied by a modest increase in hunt rate. We identified two components of the hunting sequence that are jointly modified by experience. At the onset of the hunting sequence, the orientation strategy of the turn towards prey is modified such that experienced larvae undershoot prey azimuth. Near the end of the hunt sequence, we find that experienced larvae are more likely to employ high-speed capture swims initiated from longer distances to prey. Combined, these modified turn and capture manoeuvrers can be used to predict the probability of capture success and suggest that their development provides advantages specific to larvae feeding on live-prey. Our findings establish an ethologically relevant paradigm in zebrafish for studying how the brain is shaped by experience to drive the ontogeny of efficient behaviour.",1783,381,594,40.0

Existing studies reported that learning ability can be enhanced by enriched environment and impaired by stressful context. However, it is still unclear whether diversified environment can reverse or ameliorate the learning difficulty caused by stressful context. In this study, several behavioral tasks were designed to test the role of diversified environment in active avoidance learning. In the present study, sound-cued active avoidance (two-way shuttle box) acted as learning paradigm. Multiple shuttle boxes with the identical size but different designs were employed to mimic diversified environment in learning tasks. Mild but inevitable foot shocking was adopted to increase animal’s stress to certain context. To quantify the depression/anxiety level of animals, open field test, forced swimming test, light-dark box test, and elevated plus maze were performed. The following findings were reported. First, diversified learning environment could improve learning ability in active avoidance, as manifested by higher successful rate and sharper learning curve. Second, elevating the stress level of animal to a certain context could noticeably reduce its performance in active avoidance learning. Third, the learning impairment attributed to stressful context can be improved by training in diversified environments. Thus, as revealed from the results, learning impairment caused by stressful context can be alleviated by diversified learning environment which may facilitate further medical and education applications.",741,108,159,20.0

However, when female density varied concomitantly with variation in vegetation cover, the males associated more with higher foliage density patches irrespective of the female density in that patch.

These interactions are often seen as social feedback rules, whereby individuals copy the decisions they observe others making, creating a coherent group decision. The benefit of these behavioural rules to the individual agent can be understood as a transfer of information, whereby a focal individual learns about the world by gaining access to the information possessed by others. Previous studies have analysed this exchange of information by assuming that all agents share common goals. While differences in information and differences in preferences have often been conflated, little is known about how differences between agents’ underlying preferences affects the use and efficacy of social information. In this paper I develop a model of social information use by rational agents with differing preferences, and demonstrate that the resulting collective behaviour is strongly dependent on the structure of preference sharing within the group, as well as the quality of information in the environment. In particular, I show that strong social responses are expected by individuals that are habituated to noisy, uncertain environments where private information about the world is relatively weak. Furthermore, by investigating heterogeneous group structures I demonstrate a potential influence of cryptic minority subgroups that may illuminate the empirical link between personality and leadership.",926,105,346,10.0

Whether in nature or human conflict, camouflage aims to make the problem harder, while conspicuous signals (e.g. for warning or mate attraction) require the opposite. Our goal is to provide a reliable method for identifying the hardest and easiest to find patterns, for any given environment. The problem is challenging because the parameter space provided by varying natural scenes and potential patterns is vast. Here we successfully solve the problem using deep learning with genetic algorithms and illustrate our solution by identifying appropriate patterns in two environments. To show the generality of our approach, we do so for both trichromatic and dichromatic visual systems. Patterns were validated using human participants; those identified as the best camouflage were significantly harder to find than a widely adopted military camouflage pattern, while those identified as most conspicuous were significantly easier than other patterns. Our method, dubbed the ‘Camouflage Machine’, will be a useful tool for those interested in identifying the most effective patterns in a given context.",1410,304,591,24.0

While there is growing evidence that gamification has positive effects on intrinsic motivation and engagement, it is largely unknown whether these effects translate to improved cognitive performance. Here, we examine whether gamification affects performance on a visual working memory (VWM) task. In Experiment 1, we gamified a standard delayed-estimation task by introducing scores and a leveling system. On each trial, the subject’s estimation error was mapped to a score between −100 and +100 and added to their total score. Subjects started at a set size of 1 and “leveled up” to the next set size each time they had accumulated 1,500 points. Post-experiment questionnaire data confirmed that subjects who performed the gamified version of the task were more motivated than control subjects. However, we found no difference in VWM performance between these two groups, nor between below-median and above-median motivated subjects. In Experiment 2, we tested for effects of trial-by-trial manipulations of motivation on VWM performance, by varying the scoring function across trials. Three scoring functions were used, with maxima of 7, 21, and 101 points. At the beginning of each trial, the subject was informed whether the potential reward was “low”, “medium”, or “high”. Post-questionnaire data showed that subjects were more motivated on high-reward trials. However, we found no evidence for a difference in performance between the three reward levels. Our results suggest that gamification increases people’s motivation to carry out visual working memory tasks, but it does not necessarily increase their performance.",1101,152,385,24.0

Here, we approach this question by testing whether increasing monetary incentives results in better overall VWM performance. In two experiments, subjects performed a delayed-estimation task on the Amazon Turk platform. In both experiments, four groups of subjects received a bonus payment based on their performance, with the maximum bonus ranging from $0 to $10 between groups. We found no effect of the amount of bonus on intrinsic motivation or on VWM performance in either experiment. These results suggest that resource allocation in visual working memory is insensitive to monetary reward, which has implications for resource-rational theories of VWM.",1709,246,570,13.0

The relative contribution to recognition memory are commonly distinguished in humans by analyzing receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves; analogous methods are more complex and very rare in animals but fast familiarity and slow recollective-like processes (FF/SR) have been detected in non-human primates (NHPs) based on analyzing recognition error response time profiles. The relative utility of these methods to investigate familiarity and recollection/recollection-like processes across species is uncertain; indeed, even how comparable the FF/SR measures are across humans and NHPs remains unclear. Therefore in this study a broadly similar recognition memory task was exploited in both humans and NHPs to investigate the time course of the two recognition processes. We first show that the FF/SR dissociation exists in this task in human participants and then we demonstrate a similar profile in NHPs which suggests that FF/SR processes are comparable across species. We then verified, using ROC-derived indices for each time-bin in the FF/SR profile, that the ROC and FF/DR measures are related. Hence we argue that the FF/SR approach, procedurally easier in animals, can be used as a decent proxy to investigate these two recognition processes in future animal studies, important given that scant data exists as to the neural basis underlying recollection yet many of the most informative techniques primarily exist in animal models.",804,245,206,34.0

We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies – one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment – we show how this decay kernel improves the model’s predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection.

Most models of collective decision-making assume that groups reach a consensus during a decision-making bout, often through simple majority rule. In many natural and sociological systems, however, groups may fail to reach consensus, resulting in stalemates. Here, we build on opinion dynamics and collective wisdom models to examine how stalemates may affect the wisdom of crowds. For simple environments, where individuals have access to independent sources of information, we find that stalemates improve collective accuracy by selectively filtering out incorrect decisions. In complex environments, where individuals have access to both shared and independent information, this effect is even more pronounced, restoring the wisdom of crowds in regions of parameter space where large groups perform poorly when making decisions using majority rule. We identify network properties that tune the system between consensus and accuracy, providing mechanisms by which animals, or evolution, could dynamically adjust the collective decision-making process in response to the reward structure of the possible outcomes. Overall, these results highlight the adaptive potential of stalemale filtering for improving the decision-making abilities of group-living animals.",1204,232,387,11.0

We describe a dense supercolony-like aggregation of more than 1 300 nests of the ant Formica (Coptoformica) pressilabris. We performed aggression bioassays and found that, while aggression levels were generally low, there was some aggression within the assumed supercolony. The occurrence of aggression increased with distance from the focal nest, in accordance with the genetically viscous population structure we observe by using 10 microsatellite markers. However, the aggressive interactions do not follow any clear pattern that would allow specifying colony borders within the area. The genetic data indicate limited gene flow within and away from the supercolony.

Here we examined the relationship between perceived vocal arousal and auditory context. We presented listeners with nonverbal vocalizations (yells of a single vowel) at varying levels of portrayed vocal arousal, in two musical contexts (clean guitar, distorted guitar) and one non-musical context (modulated noise). As predicted, vocalizations with higher levels of portrayed vocal arousal were judged as more negative and more emotionally aroused than the same voices produced with low vocal arousal. Moreover, both the perceived valence and emotional arousal of vocalizations were significantly affected by both musical and non-musical contexts. These results show the importance of auditory context in judging emotional arousal and valence in voices and music, and suggest that nonlinear features in music are processed similarly to communicative vocal signals.",691,80,247,10.0

The aim of this study was to find out how people who score low or high on affectivity scales assess their memory of emotional material. We used a free-recall task with self-referential neutral, positive, and negative adjectives. The results show the affectivity congruence effect: the number of negative words recalled is related to affectivity; it increases with Negative Affectivity (NA) and decreases with Positive Affectivity (PA). Metacognitive assessment of future recall is also related to affectivity. Higher PA is related to higher JOLs for positive words and lower JOLs for negative words. Higher NA is related to higher JOLs for negative words and lower JOLs for positive words.

Decreased resources during childhood has been associated with increased risk for developing stress-related disorders, including major depressive disorder and anxiety Although the link between early life adversity and increased risk for psychopathology has been well established, the developmental mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of poverty-like rearing, limited bedding and nesting materials (LB), we tested the effects of LB on the development of fear learning and of key neuronal structures involved in emotional regulation, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). LB delayed the ability of pre-adolescent mice to express, but not form, an auditory conditioned fear memory. LB disrupted typical fear circuit development, accelerating parvalbumin positive (PV+) inhibitory interneuron maturation in the BLA and delaying the maturation of connections between the mPFC and BLA. The decreased fear expression in LB reared mice during early development was rescued through optogenetic inactivation of PV+ cells in the BLA. Together our data demonstrate that LB has profound and deleterious effects on mPFC and BLA development, decreasing threat-associated behavior expression, but not learning, in childhood.

We observed eye movements that appeared to continuously track the goal location even when no visible target was present there. Accurate goal-tracking was associated with improved task performance, and inhibiting eye movements in humans impaired navigation precision. By using passive stimulus playback and manipulating stimulus reliability, we show that subjects’ eye movements are likely voluntary, rather than reflexive.

To provide novel insight into the ongoing debate, we developed a non-visual paradigm for testing navigation by layout geometry. We tested the house crickets to find a cool spot positioned centrally in heated arenas of different shapes. We found that the symmetry of the arena significantly facilitates how crickets learn to find the center of the arena, both in terms of time spent on the cool spot and the latency of locating it.

While dominant individuals are often assumed to be most influential, the behavioral traits that make them dominant may also make them socially aversive and thereby reduce their influence. Here we examine the influence of dominant and subordinate males on group behavior in different social contexts using the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. We find that phenotypically dominant males display behavioral traits that typify leadership across taxonomic systems – aggressive, social centrality, and movement leadership, while subordinate males are passive, socially peripheral, and have little influence over movement. However, in a more complex group-consensus task involving visual cue associations, subordinate males become the most effective agents of social change. We find that dominant males are spatially distant and have lower signal-to-noise ratios of informative behavior in the association task, potentially interfering with their ability to generate group-consensus. In contrast, subordinate males are physically close to other group members, have high signal-to-noise behaviors in the association task, and visual connectivity to other group members equal to that of dominant males. The attributes that define effective social influence are therefore highly context-specific, with socially and phenotypically dominant males being influential in routine but not complex social scenarios. These results demonstrate that behavioral traits that are typical of socially dominant individuals may actually reduce their social influence in other contexts.Significance Statement The attributes that allow individuals to attain positions of social power and dominance are common across many vertebrate social systems – aggression, intimidation, coercion. Yet these traits are socially aversive, and can make dominant individuals poor agents of social change. In a vertebrate system (social cichlid fish) we show that dominant males are aggressive, socially central, and lead group movement. Yet dominant males are poor effectors of consensus in an more sophisticated association task compared with passive, socially-peripheral subordinate males. The most effective agents of social influence possess behavioral traits opposite of those typically found in position of social dominance, suggesting the behavioral processes that generate social dominance may simultaneously place the most ineffective leaders in positions of power.",1979,293,686,18.0

Weakly electric fish generate a species- and individual-specific electric organ discharge (EOD) and therefore provide a unique opportunity for individual tracking without tagging. We here present and test tracking algorithms based on recordings with submerged electrode arrays. Harmonic structures extracted from power spectra provide fish identity. Localization of fish based on weighted averages of their EOD amplitudes is found to be more robust than fitting a dipole model. We apply these techniques to monitor a community of three species, Apteronotus rostratus, Eigenmannia humboldtii, and Sternopygus dariensis, in their natural habitat in Darién, Panamá. We found consistent upstream movements after sunset followed by downstream movements in the second half of the night. Extrapolations of these movements and estimates of fish density obtained from additional transect data suggest that some fish cover at least several hundreds of meters of the stream per night. Most fish, including Eigenmannia, were traversing the electrode array solitarily. From in-situ measurements of the decay of the EOD amplitude with distance of individual animals we estimated that fish can detect conspecifics at distances of up to 2 m. Our recordings also emphasize the complexity of natural electrosensory scenes resulting from the interactions of the EODs of different species. Electrode arrays thus provide an unprecedented window into the so-far hidden nocturnal activities of multispecies communities of weakly electric fish at an unmatched level of detail.Summary statement Detailed movement patterns and complex electrosensory scenes of three species of weakly electric fish were tracked without tagging using a submerged electrode array in a small Neotropical stream.",1265,152,766,27.0

Here, we present the results of systematic studies of multimodal cue use in navigating wood ants, Formica rufa. Ants learnt to navigate to a feeder that was defined by an olfactory cue, visual cue and airflow presented together. When ants learnt to find a feeder that was placed in the centre of the visual cue, well-trained ants were not anymore able to accurately approach the feeder when either the olfactory or visual cue were removed in tests. This confirms that some form of cue binding has taken place. However, in a visually simpler task with the feeder located at the edge of the visual cue, ants still approached the feeder accurately when individual cue components were removed. Hence, cue binding is flexible and depends on the navigational context. In general, cues act additively in determining the ants’ paths accuracy, i.e. the use of multiple cues increased navigation performance. Moreover, across different training conditions, we saw different motor patterns in response to different sensory cues. For instance, ants had more sinuous paths with more turns when they followed an odour plume but did not have any visual cues. Having visual information with the odour enhanced performance and therefore positively impacted on plume following. Interestingly, paths characteristics of ants from the two multimodal groups with a different visual task were different, suggesting that the observed flexibility in cue binding may be a result of the ants’ movement characteristics.Summary statement We investigated the impact of multimodal information on navigating ants.

The inadequacy of this simplification is highlighted by recent studies that have taken multiple measures of conditioned behavior: Different measures of conditioned behavior provide the basis for drawing opposite conclusions about VCS-US. Here, we develop a simple model involving reciprocal associations between the CS and US (VCS-US and VUS-CS) that simulates these qualitative individual differences in conditioned behavior.

This contrasts with psychophysics where decision agents are typically rewarded only if they choose the ‘correct’ or best option. The analysis of optimal policies for value-based decisions raises interesting and surprising parallels with decision rules proposed for accuracy-based decisions in binary and multi-alternative cases, and explains experimentally-observed deviations from rationality. However, the analysis assumes that decision agents should treat time as a linear cost, and thus optimise their Bayes Risk from decisions. A more naturalistic assumption is that future rewards are geometrically discounted, since they are less likely to be realised in an uncertain world. Changing the way in which time is costed leads to substantive changes in the resulting optimal policies, explains empirical data that previously could not be explained, and makes falsifiable predictions for future experiments.",1068,92,336,14.0

It is not known, however, whether it reflects, as in vertebrates, the operating of an underlying general magnitude system that estimates quantities irrespective of dimensions (e.g., number, space, time) and format (discrete, continuous). We investigated whether bees spontaneously transfer discrete discrimination of number to continuous discrimination of size. Bees were trained to discriminate between different numerical comparisons having either a 0.5 (2 vs. 4 and 4 vs. 8) or 0.67 ratio (2 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 6). Half of the subjects learnt to choose the smaller quantity and the other half the larger quantity. Bees were then tested for spontaneous choice (in the absence of reward) using comparisons with identical numbers but different sizes. Irrespective of the ratio of the stimuli, bees trained to select the smaller numerical quantity chose the congruent smaller size; bees trained to choose the larger numerical quantity chose the congruent larger size.

Surprisingly, research investigating the effects of electronic cigarette nicotine vapor exposure on impulsivity has not been conducted. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on impulsive choice.Methods Twenty-four adult male rats were trained in the delay discounting task to choose between small immediate food rewards or larger food rewards with delayed deliveries. After 24 days of training in the delay discounting task, rats were passively exposed to vapor containing either 0, 12, or 24 mg/mL of nicotine for 10 days. To monitor exposure to nicotine, serum cotinine levels were assessed on exposure days 1, 5, and 10 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following vapor exposure, rats were retrained in the delay discounting task until stable performance was achieved, and the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on choice preference were assessed.Results Rats that were exposed to 12 and 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor displayed higher serum cotinine levels, relative to those exposed to 0 mg/mL nicotine vapor. There were no differences in impulsive choice between any of the vapor groups when tested 15-21 days after exposure. However, increases in impulsive choice were observed when testing immediately following exposure to 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor, relative to immediately following exposure to 0 mg/mL nicotine vapor.Conclusions Findings suggest that while exposure to nicotine vapor may not cause long-term changes in decision making, it can cause short-term increases in impulsive choice, an effect that can have negative social and health consequences.",1253,327,590,28.0

We anticipate that in response migrant semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) have adjusted migratory behaviour, including a shift in stopover site usage towards locations offering greater safety from falcon predation.We assessed semipalmated sandpiper stopover usage within the Atlantic Canada Shorebird Survey dataset. Based on 3,030 surveys (totalling ∼32M birds) made during southward migration, 1974 - 2017, at 198 stopover locations, we assessed the spatial distribution of site usage in each year (with a ‘priority matching distribution’ index, PMD) in relation to the size (intertidal area) and safety (proportion of a site’s intertidal area further than 150m of the shoreline) of each location. The PMD index value is &gt; 1 when usage is concentrated at dangerous locations, 1.0 when usage matches location size, and &lt; 1 when usage is concentrated at safer locations.A large majority of migrants were found at the safest sites in all years, however our analysis of the PMD demonstrated that the fraction using safer sites increased over time. In 1974, 80% of birds were found at the safest 20% of the sites, while in 2017, this had increased to 97%. A sensitivity analysis shows that the shift was made specifically towards safer (and not just larger) sites. The shift as measured by a PMD index decline cannot be accounted for by possible biases inherent in the data set. We conclude that the data support the prediction that increasing predator danger has induced a shift by southbound migrant semipalmated sandpipers to safer sites.",1335,198,386,23.0

Laboratory studies have implicated an important role of circadian clocks in behavioural timing and rhythmicity. Yet, recent studies on clock-mutant animals questioned this importance under more naturalistic settings, as various clock mutants showed nearly normal diel activity rhythms under semi-natural Zeitgeber conditions.We here report evidence that proper timing of eclosion, a vital behaviour of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, requires a functional molecular clock even under quasi-natural conditions. In contrast to wildtype flies, period01 mutants with a defective molecular clock eclose mostly arrhythmically in a temperate environment even in the presence of a full complement of abiotic Zeitgebers. Moreover, period01 mutants eclose during a much larger portion of the day, and peak eclosion time becomes more susceptible to variable day-to-day changes of light and temperature. Under the same conditions, flies with impaired peptidergic inter-clock signalling (pdf01 and han5304 mutants) stayed largely rhythmic with normal gate sizes. Our results suggest that the presence of natural Zeitgebers can mitigate a loss of peptide-mediated phasing between central clock neuron groups, but cannot substitute for the lack of a functional molecular clock under natural temperate conditions.",937,152,410,20.0

Understanding innovation processes in insects has lagged behind partly because they are not perceived to have the cognitive machinery required to innovate. This perception is however challenged by recent evidence demonstrating sophisticated cognitive capabilities in insects despite their small brains. Here, we study the innovation capacity of a solitary bee (Osmia cornuta) in the laboratory by exposing naïve individuals to an obstacle removal task. We also studied the underlying cognitive and non-cognitive mechanisms through a battery of experimental tests designed to measure learning, exploration, shyness and activity levels. We found that solitary bees can innovate, with 11 of 29 individuals (38%) being able to solve a new task consisting in lifting a lid to reach a reward. The propensity to innovate was uncorrelated with learning capacities, but increased with exploration, boldness and activity. These results provide solid evidence that non-social insects can innovate, and highlight the importance of interpreting innovation in the light of non-cognitive processes.",799,224,264,24.0

Signalling behaviours may also evolve to interfere with signals of their opponents, e.g. by temporally overlapping them with their own, such as the song overlapping behaviour that is seen in some songbirds during aggressive interactions. Song overlapping has been proposed to be a signal of aggressive intent, but few studies directly examined the association between song overlapping and aggressive behaviours of the overlapping bird (the predictive criterion). In the present paper we examined the question of whether song overlapping is correlated with aggressive behaviours displayed during a simulated territorial intrusion in a population of great tits (Parus major) living in an urban-rural gradient. We also examined whether aggressive behaviours are correlated with the ambient noise levels. We found that overlapping was associated negatively with aggressive behaviours males displayed against a simulated intruder. These results fail to support the predictive criterion for song overlapping, raising the question whether overlapping is in fact a signal of aggressive intent. Ambient noise levels were associated positively with aggressive behaviours but did not correlate with song rate, song duration or song overlapping. Great tits in noisy urban habitats may display higher levels of aggressive behaviours due to either interference of noise in aggressive communication or another indirect effect of noise.",1146,550,438,23.0

However, the mechanisms underlying arthropod perception of polarized reflections from objects such as plants are not well understood. The small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, has been demonstrated to exploit foliar polarized reflections, specifically the degree of linear polarization (DoLP), to recognize host plants. The well-described visual system of P. rapae includes several photoreceptor types (red, green, blue) that are sensitive to polarized light. Yet, the mechanism underlying the behavioral responses of P. rapae to stimuli with different DoLPs remains unknown. To investigate potential mechanisms, we designed several two-choice behavioral bioassays, displaying plant images on paired LCD monitors which allowed for independent control of polarization, color and intensity. We found that shifts in image intensity had a similar effect on P. rapae preferences for stimuli dissimilar in DoLP and dissimilar in color, suggesting DoLP differences are perceived as color. When a DoLP choice was offered between plant images manipulated in a manner to minimizing the response of blue, red, or blue and red photoreceptors, P. rapae shifted its preference for DoLP, suggesting a role for red, green and blue polarization-sensitive photoreceptors. Modeling of P. rapae photoreceptor responses to test stimuli suggests that differential DoLP is not perceived solely as a color difference. Our combined results suggest that P. rapae females process and interpret polarization reflections in a way different from that described for other polarization-sensitive taxa.",648,144,210,24.0

We trained a set of mice on a visual change detection task with multiple stages, starting with direct transitions between gratings, adding an intervening gray screen, and subsequently moving to multiple sets of natural images. We observe that, when progressing to new stages, the performance increases very fast. However, when transitioning to a task of higher complexity, the peak performance decreases. This setup facilitates for the first time an experimental platform to study the transfer learning phenomena in mice using visual stimuli. Based on these results and additional neuroscience insight, we propose a cognitive model to explain the quick adaptation observed in mice. It extends a deep Q learning agent with a multi-tiered architecture and the possibility of performing a representation remapping at every level of the hierarchy to prevent the downstream propagation of representation anomalies. This architecture provides the substrate of an adaptation algorithm based on ideas of optimal transport of probability distributions. It matches well key behavioral aspects observed in mice and the experimental constraint that the mice are initially trained using a single task variant before it transitions to the new training phase. The modelling process helped us to gain biological insights: first, the optimal transport mechanism of the representation remapping indicated that a possible reason for the reduced performance when mice move to a new more complex task could be due to limited representation resources which were optimized for the previous task. Second, the multi-tiered architecture was first an engineering constraint and later a biologic insight confirmed by the literature. A final insight came from the computations required to perform the representation remapping. These computations are interesting because they could help to confirm this transfer learning theory by looking for similar neural correlates during the adaptation process.",1064,248,314,18.0

Calls of the trill type are the most common, yet difficult to study, because they are not very loud and uttered in conditions when animals are in close proximity to one another. Here we recorded trill calls in captive pair-housed marmosets using wearable microphones, while the animals were together with their partner or separated, but within trill call range. Trills were exchanged mainly with the partner and not with other animals in the room. Animals placed outside the home cage increased their trill call rate and uttered more trills in response more to their partner. The fundamental frequency, F0, of trills increased when animals were placed outside the cage. Our results indicate that trill calls can be monitored using wearable audio equipment.

Especially when studying animal behavior, confounding factors such as novel test apparatus can lead to a wide variability of data. At worst, effects of novelty or stress related behavior can mask treatment effects and the behavioral data may be misinterpreted. Habituation to the test situation is a common practice to circumvent novelty induced increases in variance and to improve the reliability of the respective measurements. However, there is a lack of published empirical knowledge regarding reasonable habituation procedures and a method validation seems to be overdue.This study aimed at setting up a simple strategy to increase reliability of behavioral data. Therefore, exemplary data from mice tested in an Open Field (OF) arena were used to elucidate the potential of habituation and how reliability of measures can be confirmed by means of a repeatability analysis using the software R. On seven consecutive days, male C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and 129S1/SvImJ mice were tested in an OF arena once daily and individual mouse behavior (distance travelled, average activity) was recorded. A repeatability analysis was conducted in order to estimate the reliability of measured animal behavior with regard to repeated trials of habituation.Our data analysis revealed that monitoring animal behavior during habituation is important to determine when individual differences of the measurements are stable. Here, the mixed effect model framework proved to be a powerful tool for estimating repeatability values. Repeatability values from distance travelled and average activity increased over the habituation period, revealing that around 60 % of the variance of the data can be explained by individual differences between mice. The first day of habituation was statistically significantly different from the following 6 days in terms of distance travelled and average activity. A habituation period of three days appeared to be sufficient in this study. Overall these results emphasize the importance of habituation and in depth analysis of habituation data to define the correct starting point of the experiment for improving the reliability and reproducibility of experimental data.",855,361,271,18.0

These strategies become more complicated when food and risk can be simultaneously present and when they differ in predictability. For example, there may be multiple paths to reach a foraging site that vary in risk. This study examines how colonies of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) respond to such a situation where identical-length paths differ in how they present risk. The risk cues are either a live competitor (velvety tree ants, Liometopum occidentale (LO)) or formic acid (FA), a defensive chemical commonly associated with formicine ant species. Across four paths to food, the presence of cues also varied from always to never present. Although the non-risky path was used more often, in no case did colonies completely avoid the paths with risk. Overall, more L. humile workers explored paths associated with LO than with FA. This had a significant impact on foraging ability where LO colonies were faster at finding food than FA colonies. Further, L. humile workers’ response to FA was similar over time while declined for LO, suggesting a ‘dear enemy’ habituation and reduction in aggression over time. Thus, it appears that L. humile foragers categorize risk cues and will vary their responses in potentially effective ways.",609,87,160,13.0

However, at present the development of those models usually requires direct observation of the target animals.The goal of this study was to infer behaviour of wild, free roaming animals from acceleration data by training behaviour classification models on captive individuals, without the necessity to observe their wild conspecifics. We further sought to develop methods to validate the credibility of the resulting behaviour extrapolations.We trained two machine learning algorithms proposed by the literature, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), on data from captive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and later applied them to data from wild foxes. We also tested a new advance for behaviour classification, by applying a moving window to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, we investigated four strategies to validate our classification output.While all three machine learning algorithms performed well under training conditions, the established methods, RF and SVM, failed in classifying distinct behaviours when transferred from captive to wild foxes. Behaviour classification with the ANN and a moving window, in contrast, inferred distinct behaviours and showed consistent results for most individuals.Our approach is a substantial improvement over the methods previously proposed in the literature as it generated plausible results for wild fox behaviour. We were able to infer the behaviour of wild animals that have never been observed in the wild and to further illustrate the outputs credibility.

In bees, vibrations are used in a variety of contexts including communication, as a warning signal to deter predators and during pollen foraging. However, little is known about how the biomechanical properties of bee vibrations vary across multiple behaviours within a species. In this study, we compared the properties of vibrations produced by Bombus terrestris audax (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers in three contexts: during flight, during defensive buzzing, and in floral vibrations produced during pollen foraging on two buzz-pollinated plants (Solanum, Solanaceae). Using laser vibrometry, we were able to obtain contactless measures of both the frequency and amplitude of the thoracic vibrations of bees across the three behaviours. Despite all three types of vibrations being produced by the same power flight muscles, we found clear differences in the mechanical properties of the vibrations produced in different contexts. Both floral and defensive buzzes had higher frequency and amplitude velocity, acceleration, and displacement than the vibrations produced during flight. Floral vibrations had the highest frequency, amplitude velocity and acceleration of all the behaviours studied. Vibration amplitude, and in particular acceleration, of floral vibrations has been suggested as the key property for removing pollen from buzz-pollinated anthers. By increasing frequency and amplitude velocity and acceleration of their vibrations during vibratory pollen collection, foraging bees may be able to maximise pollen removal from flowers, although their foraging decisions are likely to be influenced by the presumably high cost of producing floral vibrations.",707,1312,382,40.0

Theoretical studies have shown that collective choices can emerge in a homogeneous group of individuals following identical rules, but real animals show much evidence for heterogeneity in the degree and nature of their contribution to group decisions. In social insects, for example, the transmission and processing of information is influenced by a well-organized division of labour. Studies that accurately quantify how this behavioural heterogeneity affects the spread of information among group members are still lacking. In this paper, we look at nest choices during colony emigrations of the ant Temnothorax rugatulus and quantify the degree of behavioural heterogeneity of workers. Using methods from both machine learning and network analysis, we identify and characterize four behavioural castes of workers – primary, secondary, passive, and wandering – covering distinct roles in the spread of information during each emigration. This detailed characterization of the contribution of each worker can improve models of collective decision-making in this species and promises a deeper understanding of behavioural variation at the colony level.",1088,161,439,19.0

The present results showed that locomotor activity decreased with age, similar to findings in many other animal species. However, foraging ability increased with age. Namely, the decline in locomotor activity with age did not lead to a decline in foraging ability.

Current literature assumes that these insects are mostly driven by attractive visual memories, which are learnt when the insect’s gaze is precisely oriented toward the goal direction, typically along its familiar route or towards its nest. That way, an insect could return home by simply moving in the direction that appears most familiar. Here we show using virtual reconstructions of natural environments that this principle suffers from fundamental drawbacks, notably, a given view of the world does not provide information about whether the agent should turn or not to reach its goal. We propose a simple model where the agent continuously compares its current view with both goal and anti-goal visual memories, which are treated as attractive and repulsive respectively. We show that this strategy effectively results in an opponent process, albeit not at the perceptual level – such as those proposed for colour vision or polarisation detection – but at the level of environmental space. This opponent process results in a signal that strongly correlates with the angular error of the current body orientation so that a single view of the world now suffices to indicate whether the agent should turn or not. By incorporating this principle into a simple agent navigating in reconstructed natural environments, we show that it overcomes the usual shortcomings and produces a step-increase in navigation effectiveness and robustness. Our findings provide a functional explanation to recent behavioural observations in ants and why and how so-called aversive and appetitive memories must be combined. We propose a likely neural implementation based on the insect mushroom bodies’ circuitry that produces behavioural and neural predictions contrasting with previous models.Author summary Insects such as ants and bees are excellent navigators, able to learn long foraging routes and return to their nest in complex natural habitats. To achieve this, it is believed that individuals memorise views – the visual scene as they perceive it – only when their body is precisely oriented towards the goal. As a result, the insect can return to its goal by simply being attracted in the direction that represents the highest visual familiarity. Here we use a computational approach to show that this strategy suffers from a major weakness: a single view of the world does not suffice to tell whether the agent should turn or not to reach its goal. However, a surprisingly robust solution to this problem arises if we simply assume that these insects memorise not only goal-oriented views but also anti-goal-oriented views that they then treat as repulsive. This idea clarifies several observed behaviours that were difficult to explain with previous models. Overall, this research helps us to understand how insects combine memories in specific brain areas and can navigate so efficiently despite their tiny brain.",817,141,243,38.0

In vertebrates, kin discrimination often occurs through prior association. There is less evidence for recognition of unfamiliar kin. Here, we present the first evidence of unfamiliar kin recognition in bats. We captured female vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from a single roost, allowed them to breed in captivity for 22 months, then released 17 wild-caught females and six captive-born daughters back into the same wild roost. We then used custom-built proximity sensors to track the free-ranging social encounters among the previously captive bats and 27 tagged control bats from the same roost. Using microsatellite-based relatedness estimates, we found that previously captive bats preferentially associated with related control bats, and that captive-born bats preferentially associated with unfamiliar kin among control bats. Closer analyses showed that these unfamiliar-kin-biased associations were not caused by mothers or other familiar close kin, because the kinship bias was evident even when those bats were not nearby. This striking evidence for unfamiliar kin recognition in vampire bats warrants further investigation and provides new hypotheses for how cooperative relationships might be driven synergistically by both social experience and phenotypic similarity.",1020,177,312,19.0

It is thus surprising that there has been no attempt to quantify what are the chances of being jammed, or how such jamming would affect a bat’s hunting. To test this, we developed a computer model, simulating numerous bats foraging in proximity. We used a comprehensive sensorimotor model of a hunting bat, taking into consideration the physics of sound propagation and bats’ hearing physiology. We analyzed the instantaneous acoustic signals received by each bat, and were able to tease apart the effects of acoustic interference and of direct resource competition. Specifically, we examined the effectiveness of the spectral Jamming Avoidance Response - a shift in signal frequencies - which has been suggested as a solution for the jamming problem. As expected, we found that hunting performance deteriorates when bats forage near conspecific. However, applying a Jamming Avoidance Response did not improve hunting, and our simulations clearly demonstrate the reason: bats have adequate natural signal variability due to their constant adjustment of echolocation signals to the task. The probability to be jammed is thus small and further shifting the frequencies does not mitigate spectral jamming. Our simulations reveal both negative and positive insight: they show how bats can hunt successfully in a group despite potential sensory interference and they suggest that a Jamming Avoidance Response is not useful.",659,138,254,42.0

However, few empirical examples of variation in collective cognition emerges from variation in individual cognition exist. Here, we show that interactions among individuals that differ in the performance of a cognitive task drives collective foraging behavior in honey bee colonies by utilizing a naturally variable and heritable learning behavior called latent inhibition (LI). We artificially selected two distinct phenotypes: high LI bees that are better at ignoring previously unrewarding familiar stimuli, and low LI bees that can learn previously unrewarding and novel stimuli equally well. We then provided colonies composed of these distinct phenotypes with a choice between a familiar feeder or a novel feeder. Colonies of high LI individuals preferred to visit familiar food locations, while low LI colonies visited novel and familiar food locations equally. However, in colonies of mixed learning phenotypes, the low LI bees showed a preference to visiting familiar feeders, which contrasts with their behavior when in a uniform low LI group. We show that the shift in feeder preference of low LI bees is driven by foragers of the high LI phenotype dancing more intensely and attracting more followers. Our results reveal that cognitive abilities of individuals and their interactions drive emergent collective outcomes.Significance Statement Variation in individual cognition affects how animals perceive their environment and which information they share with others. Here we provide empirical evidence that how individual honey bees learn contributes to collective cognition of a colony. By creating colonies of distinct learning phenotypes, we evaluated how bees make foraging choices in the field. Colonies containing individuals that learn to ignore unimportant information preferred familiar food locations, however colonies of individuals that are unable to ignore familiar information visit novel and familiar feeders equally. A 50/50 mix of these phenotypes prefer familiar food locations, because individuals who learn the familiar location recruit nestmates by dancing more intensely. Our results reveal that variation in individual cognition scales non-linearly to shape collective outcomes.",2229,333,765,34.0

We tested the parasite–pathogen hypothesis in the polyandrous wasp Vespula shidai. We infected isolated workers with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and quantified their survival in the laboratory. Additionally, we conducted paternity analysis of the workers using nine microsatellite loci to investigate the relationship between survival and matriline/patriline of the workers. As predicted by the parasite–pathogen hypothesis, nestmate workers of different patrilines showed differential resistance to B. bassiana.

But how can individuals know when to trust others? Here, I develop the theory that reputation building may signal cooperative intent, or ‘trustworthiness’. I model a simple representation of this theory in which individuals (1) optionally invest in a reputation by performing costly helpful behaviour (‘signalling’); (2) optionally use others’ reputations when choosing a partner; and (3) optionally cooperate with that partner. In evolutionary simulations, high levels of reputation building; of choosing partners based on reputation; and of cooperation within partnerships emerged. Costly helping behaviour evolved into an honest signal of trustworthiness when it was adaptive for cooperators, relative to defectors, to invest in the long-term benefits of a reputation for helping. I show using game theory that this occurs when cooperators gain larger marginal benefits from investing in signalling than do defectors. This happens without the usual costly signalling assumption that individuals are of two ‘types’ which differ in quality. Signalling of trustworthiness may help explain phenomena such as philanthropy, pro-sociality, collective action, punishment, and advertising in humans and may be particularly applicable to courtship in other animals.",631,148,246,37.0

Aggressive behaviors were classified into 11 categories and each interaction was scored as a win, loss, or tie. As a result, V. velutina was superior to V. simillima in 153 fights where V. velutina won 71% and showed a high incidence of threatening behavior. V. mandarinia outperformed V. velutina in 104 fights where V. mandarinia won 91% and grappling behavior was common.

A PCA on data from 1225 respondents revealed four management strategies (i.e. interventions during firework exposure): the principal components “Environmental modification” (e.g. providing a hiding place, keeping windows and blinds closed, and playing music), “Feed/Play” (providing the dog with chews, play and food during fireworks in general, as well as contingent on loud bangs), “Alternative” (use of calming nutraceuticals, pheromones, herbal products, homeopathic products, Bach flowers, and essential oils) and “Interaction” (allowing body contact, petting and talking to the dog when loud bangs occurred). To explore possible effects of these management methods on fear development, the components were correlated with a score for fear progression. Of the four components, only “Feed/Play” was statistically associated with an improvement in fear responses to fireworks. To evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment strategies, owners were asked to select from a range of options which interventions they had used and whether they considered them as effective. With prescription medication (N=202), improvements were noted by 69% of owners, with high success rates reported for the most frequently prescribed drugs, alprazolam (91%) and Sileo® (74%). While individual products were not evaluated, the reported success rates for the categories “pheromones” (N=316), “herbal products” (N=282), “nutraceuticals” (N=211), “essential oils” (N=183), “homeopathic remedies” (N=250) and “Bach flowers” (N=281) were all in the range of 27-35%, which is not higher than would be expected based on a placebo effect. Pressure vests were deemed as effective by 44% of respondents (N=300). Counterconditioning (providing desirable stimuli after the occurrence of noises) was the most successful training technique according to the owners (N=694), with a reported effectiveness of over 70%. Relaxation training (N=433) was reported to be almost as successful at 69%, while noise CDs (N=377) were effective in 55% of cases. Thus, counterconditioning, relaxation training and anxiolytic medication appear to be the most effective strategies in the treatment of firework fears in dogs.

One way to investigate the behavioral mechanisms underlying ecological novelty is by comparing prey capture kinematics between groups. In this study, we investigated the contribution of kinematics to the origins of a novel ecological niche for scale-eating within a microendemic adaptive radiation of pupfishes on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We compared prey capture kinematics across three species of pupfish while consuming shrimp and scales in the lab and found that scale-eating pupfish exhibited peak gape sizes that were twice as large as all other groups, but also attacked prey with a more obtuse angle between their lower jaw and suspensorium. We then investigated how this variation in feeding kinematics could explain scale-biting performance by measuring the surface area removed per strike from standardized gelatin cubes. We found that a combination of larger peak gape and more obtuse lower jaw and suspensorium angles resulted in 67% more surface area removed per strike, indicating that scale-eaters may reside on a performance optimum for scale-biting. We also measured feeding kinematics of F1 hybrids to test whether feeding performance could contribute to reproductive isolation between species and found that F1 hybrid kinematics and performance more closely resembled those of generalists, suggesting that they may have low fitness in the scale-eating niche.

Although more men report experiencing traumatic events than women, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD is twice as high in females. Despite these data trends in humans, preclinical studies of traumatic stress reactivity have been performed almost exclusively in male animals.Methods This study was designed to examine sex differences in traumatic stress reactivity in alcohol-naïve rats and rats given intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a 2-bottle choice paradigm for 5 weeks. Rats were exposed to predator odor (bobcat urine) and tested for avoidance of the odor-paired context 24 hours later; unstressed Controls were never exposed to odor. Two days after stress, we measured physiological arousal using the acoustic startle response (ASR) test. We also measured anxiety-like behavior using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and circulating corticosterone levels before and immediately after odor exposure.Results Male and female rats exposed to predator odor displayed blunted weight gain 24 hours post-stress, but only a subset of stressed animals exhibited avoidance behavior. Chronic intermittent alcohol drinking increased the proportion of Avoiders in males and predator odor exposure increased ASR in these animals. Predator odor stress reduced ASR in females relative to unstressed females and stressed males, regardless of alcohol drinking history. Bobcat urine exposure did not promote persistent anxiety-like behavior, but alcohol-experienced males exhibited reduced activity in the EPM in comparison to alcohol-experienced females.Furthermore, predator odor increased circulating corticosterone levels in females relative to males and baseline.Conclusions We report robust sex differences in behavioral and endocrine responses to bobcat urine exposure in adult Wistar rats.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed choices made by three rhesus macaques in a computerized patch foraging task. Confirming previously observed findings, we find high levels of variability. We then show, through simulations, that this variability changes optimal thresholds, meaning that a forager aware of its own variability should increase its leaving threshold (i.e., over-stay) to increase performance.

The model, building on previous proposals on spiking neurons and plasticity rules having a probabilistic interpretation, presents these novelties at the system level: (a) the world model is learnt in parallel with its use for planning, and an arbitration mechanism decides when to exploit the world-model knowledge with planning, or to explore, on the basis of an entropy-based confidence on the world model knowledge; (b) the world model is a hidden Markov model (HMM) able to simulate sequences of states and actions, thus planning selects actions through the same neural generative process used to predict states; (c) the world model learns the hidden causes of observations, and their temporal dependencies, through a biologically plausible unsupervised learning mechanism. The model is tested with a visuomotor learning task and validated by comparing its behaviour with the performance and reaction times of human participants solving the same task. The model represents a further step towards the construction of an autonomous architecture bridging goal-directed behaviour as probabilistic inference to brain-like computations.Author summary Goal-directed behaviour relies on brain processes supporting planning of actions based on the prediction of their consequences before performing them in the environment. An important computational modelling approach of these processes sees the brain as a probabilistic machine implementing goal-directed processes relying on probability distributions and operations on them. An important challenge for this approach is to explain how these distributions and operations might be grounded on the brain spiking neurons and learning processes. Here we propose a hypothesis of how this might happen by presenting a computational model of goal-directed processes based on artificial spiking neural networks. The model presents three main novelties. First, it can plan even while it is still learning the consequences of actions by deciding if planning or exploring the environment based on how confident it is on its predictions. Second, it is able to ‘think’ alternative possible actions, and their consequences, by relying on the low-level stochasticity of neurons. Third, it can learn to anticipate the consequences of actions in an autonomous fashion based on experience. Overall, the model represents a novel hypothesis on how goal-directed behaviour might rely on the stochastic spiking processes and plasticity mechanisms of the brain neurons.",1202,97,391,36.0

After a comprehensive database search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, we included 99 publications. We performed nine meta-analyses and two qualitative syntheses corresponding to different behavioral categories, aggregating data from thousands of animals. We found evidence for reduced activity and exploration behavior (standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.28 [-0.38, −0.18]), more passive stress coping (SMD −0.37 [-0.52, −0.23]), and less efficient sensory processing (SMD −0.37 [-0.69, −0.06]) in SSRI-versus vehicle-exposed animals. No differences were found for anxiety (p=0.06), social behavior, learning and memory, ingestive- and reward behavior, motoric behavior, or reflex and pain sensitivity.

In order to better understand the flight capacity of B. dorsalis and its physiological basis, the functions and regulatory roles of juvenile hormone (JH) in the flight muscle of B. dorsalis were studied under a controlled environment. JH titer of B. dorsalis varied with age and sex. Females, irrespective of age, have higher JH than males for ovarian development and maturation in addition to better flight capabilities. The flight duration and distance of both males and females increased with the gradual increase of JH titer after adult emergences. JH titer peaked in 15-d-old adult and declined subsequently with age. Flight activity stimulated the production of JH as adults flown for 24 hours on the flight mills have the highest JH titers compare to adults tethered on shorter flight durations. Furthermore, JH III-treated adults were able to perform long-duration and long-distance flights.

McCarthy,865170;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/865170,"The means by which animals assess potential mates is an important issue in studies of reproductive systems. I tested whether an individual’s previous experiences and the relatedness of mates affected mating behavior in a simultaneous hermaphrodite snail, Physa gyrina. Previous work with this species showed reduced reproductive success resulting from both strong outbreeding and inbreeding. Thus, I predicted that individuals should prefer partners of intermediate relatedness. During activity trials, snails moved longer distances when exposed to chemical cues from conspecifics of lesser relatedness. Furthermore, during mating interactions, behavioral responses to relatedness varied with gender-role: male-role behaviors did not vary across relatedness treatments, while snails paired with either closely related or highly dissimilar partners increased their female-role resistance behaviors as interactions escalated. Experiences with their current partner also affected behavioral dynamics. Familiar pairs had fewer matings and longer latency times until a mating occurred than unfamiliar pairs. Snails acting in the female role also exhibited higher resistance rates in familiar pairs than in unfamiliar pairs. Previous, brief exposure to chemical cues in a non-mating context also influenced behavior during a subsequent mating interaction. Snails that were previously exposed to chemical cues from unfamiliar individuals tended to be more likely to occupy the male role following an encounter, and had significantly lower copulation frequencies and higher female-role resistance rates (i.e. were choosier) than those previously exposed to cues from familiar individuals. Overall, the results show that: 1) relatedness, past exposure to conspecific chemical cues, and experience with a current partner all influence mating behaviors in these snails; and 2) in these simultaneous hermaphrodites, an individual’s responses depend on whether it is occupying the male or female role.",527,83,158,39.0

It has been proposed that motor timing depends on the emergence of self-sustained dynamics across ensembles of neurons. Alternatively, evidence from operant conditioning suggests that animals can develop motor routines to adapt their behavior to fixed temporal constraints. But it is unclear whether animals can accurately time their behavior without the help of motor routines. To address this issue, we used a task in which rats, freely moving on a motorized treadmill, could obtain a reward if they approached it after a fixed interval. Most animals took advantage of the treadmill length and its moving direction to develop, by trial-and-error, a unique motor routine whose execution resulted in the precise timing of their reward approaches. Noticeably, when proficient animals occasionally failed to follow this routine, the timing of their reward approaches was systematically poor. In a second step, we trained naive animals in modified versions of the task specifically designed to prevent the development of this motor strategy. Compared to rats trained in the first protocol, these animals never reached a comparable level of timing accuracy. We conclude that motor timing critically depends on the ability of animals to develop motor routines adapted to the structure of their environment. Our work also suggests that self-sustained neuronal activity alone may not be sufficient to support motor timing, at least in the supra-second timescale.",2708,353,806,28.0

Although many fundamental aspects of host-parasite relationships have been unravelled, few studies have systematically investigated how parasites affect organismal movement. Here we combine behavioural experiments of Schistocephalus solidus infected sticklebacks with individual-based simulations to understand how parasitism affects individual movement ability and how this in turn influences social interaction patterns. Detailed movement tracking revealed that infected fish swam slower, accelerated slower, turned more slowly, and tended to be more predictable in their movements than did non-infected fish. Importantly, the strength of these effects increased with increasing parasite load (% of body weight), with the behaviour of more heavily infected fish being more impaired. When grouped, pairs of infected fish moved more slowly, were less cohesive, less aligned, and less coordinated than healthy pairs. Mixed pairs exhibited intermediate behaviours and were primarily led by the non-infected fish. These social patterns emerged naturally in model simulations of self-organised groups composed of individuals with different speeds and turning tendency, consistent with changes in mobility and manoeuvrability due to infection. Together, our results demonstrate how infection with a complex life cycle parasite affects the movement ability of individuals and how this in turn shapes social interactions, providing important mechanistic insights into the effects of parasites on host movement dynamics.",757,276,278,16.0

These studies promise to shed light on the mechanisms that might go astray in psychiatric disorders characterized by dysfunctions of emotional contagion and empathy. Here we explore whether there are sex differences in emotional contagion in rats. We use an established paradigm in which a demonstrator rat receives footshocks while freezing is measured in both the demonstrator and an observer rat, which can hear, smell and see each other. By comparing pairs of male rats with pairs of female rats, we find (i) that female demonstrators freeze less when submitted to footshocks, but that (ii) the emotional contagion response, i.e. the degree of influence across the rats, does not depend on the sex of the rats. This was true whether emotional contagion was quantified based on the slope of a regression linking demonstrator and observer average freezing, or on Granger causality estimates of moment-to-moment freezing. The lack of sex differences in emotional contagion is compatible with an interpretation of emotional contagion as serving selfish danger detection.",799,207,248,19.0

By selecting appropriate locomotor metrics, we constructed ethograms systematically describing odor-induced changes in the swimming trajectory. We found that fish reacted to most odorants, using different behavioral programs and that combination of few relevant behavioral metrics enabled to capture most of the variance in these innate odor responses. We observed that monomolecular odors in similar chemical categories were weakly clustered based on the behavioral responses, likely because natural odors elicited stronger reactions than the monomolecular odors.

The proximate causes of this individual variation in social behavior within a species have been examined in some species but its fitness consequences have been less frequently investigated. In this study, we quantified the fitness consequences of variation in the sociality of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). We characterized sociality of voles in semi-natural enclosures using an automated behavioral tracking system paired with social network analyses to quantify the degree of spatial and temporal co-occurrence of different voles. We then assessed the relationship between sociality with mating success (number of different conspecifics with which an individual produced offspring) and reproductive success (total number of offspring surviving to first capture). We measured the number of social connections each individual had with all voles and only with opposite-sex voles by calculating unweighted degree through social network analyses. Both female and male voles varied in the number of social connections they had with all conspecifics and with opposite-sex conspecifics. Voles with an intermediate number of social connections with voles of both sexes had higher mating success overall. In our analyses that considered all social connections with voles of both sexes, voles with an intermediate number of social connections produced more offspring. Males with a very high or low number of social connections also had the lowest average body mass. Overall, our results suggest some limit on the fitness benefits of sociality.

Reproductive traits, like genital morphology and mating behaviour, are some of the fastest diverging characters and can serve as reproductive barriers. The free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano, an established model for studying sex in hermaphrodites, and its congener M. janickei are closely related, but differ substantially in their male intromittent organ (stylet) morphology. Here, we examine whether these morphological differences are accompanied by differences in behavioural traits, and whether these could represent barriers to successful mating and hybridization between the two species. Our data shows that the two species differ in many aspects of their mating behaviour, with M. janickei having a five-fold longer copulation duration, copulating less frequently, and having a longer and more delayed suck behaviour (a postcopulatory behaviour likely involved in sexual conflict). Interestingly, and despite these significant morphological and behavioural differences, the two species mate readily with each other in heterospecific pairings, often showing behaviours of intermediate duration. Although both species have similar fecundity in conspecific pairings, the heterospecific pairings revealed clear postmating barriers, as only few heterospecific pairings produced F1 hybrids. These hybrids had a stylet morphology that was intermediate between that of the parental species, and they could successfully backcross to both parental species. Finally, in a mate choice experiment we tested if the worms preferentially mated with conspecifics over heterospecifics, since such a preference could represent a premating barrier. Interestingly, the experiment showed that the nearly two-fold higher mating rate of M. lignano caused it to mate more with conspecifics, leading to assortative mating, while M. janickei ended up mating more with heterospecifics. Thus, while the two species can hybridize, the mating rate differences could possibly lead to higher fitness costs for M. janickei compared to M. lignano.",548,290,228,43.0

To explore this possibility, we recorded high-speed close-up video of mice eating seeds and other food items. Analyses of ethograms and automated tracking with DeepLabCut revealed multiple distinct microstructural features of food-handling. First, we found that mice indeed made extensive use of D1 for dexterous manipulations. In particular, mice used D1 to hold food with either of two grip types: a pincer-type grasp, or a “thumb-hold” grip, pressing with D1 from the side. Thumb-holding was preferentially used for handling smaller items, with the smallest items held between the two D1s alone. Second, we observed that mice cycled rapidly between two postural modes while feeding, with the hands positioned either at the mouth (oromanual phase) or resting below (holding phase). Third, we identified two highly stereotyped D1-related movements during feeding, including an extraordinarily fast (∼20 ms) “regrip” maneuver, and a fast (∼100 ms) “sniff” maneuver. Lastly, in addition to these characteristic simpler movements and postures, we also observed highly complex movements, including rapid D1-assisted rotations of food items and dexterous simultaneous double-gripping of two food fragments. Manipulation behaviors were generally conserved for different food types, and for head-fixed mice. Wild squirrels displayed a similar repertoire of D1-related movements.

In the highly social honey bee, social time-givers are important and can override photic entrainment, but the cues mediating social synchronization are unknown. Here we tested whether substrate-borne vibrations and hive volatiles can mediate social synchronization in honey bees. We first placed newly-emerged worker bees on the same or on a different substrate on which we placed cages with foragers entrained to ambient day- night cycles, while minimizing transfer of volatiles between cages. In the second experiment, we exposed young bees to constant airflow coming from either a free-foraging colony or a similar size control hive containing only empty combs, while minimizing transfer of substrate-borne vibrations between cages. After five days, we individually isolated each focal bee in an individual cage in an environmental chamber, and monitored locomotor activity. We repeated each experiment five times, each trail with bees from a different source colony, monitoring a total of more than 1000 bees representing diverse genotypes. We found that bees placed on the same substrate as foragers showed a stronger phase coherence; and in 3 of 5 trials their phase was more similar to that of foragers, compared to bees placed on a different substrate. In the second experiment, bees exposed to air from a colony showed a stronger phase coherence, and in 4 out of 5 trial their phase was more similar to that of foragers, compared to control bees exposed to air from an empty hive.

Within venomous snake mimicry, stereotyped anti-predator displays are suggested to be a critical component of the warning signal given by toxic models and thus under strong selection for independent convergence in mimetic species. However, no studies have systematically quantified variation in snake anti-predator displays across taxonomically broad clades to test how these behaviours evolve across species within a phylogenetic comparative methods framework. Here we describe a new, high-throughput approach for collecting and scoring snake anti-predator displays in the field that demonstrates both low observer bias and infinite extension across any species. Then, we show our method’s utility in quantitatively comparing the behaviour of 20 highly-divergent snake species from the Amazonian lowlands of Peru. We found that a simple experimental setup varying simulated predator cues was very successful in eliciting anti-predator displays across species and that high-speed videography captured a greater diversity of behavioural responses than described in the literature. We also found that although different display components evolve at different rates with complicated patterns of covariance, there is clear evidence of evolutionary convergence in anti-predator displays among distantly related elapid coral snakes and their colubrid mimics.

Nonhuman primate vocal behavior, by contrast, is comparably inflexible, with different call types tied to specific functions. Our research challenges the generality of this claim, with new findings of flexible vocal behavior in infant chimpanzees. We used artificial intelligence consisting of automated feature extraction and supervised learning algorithms to analyze grunt and whimper vocalizations from free-ranging infants during their first year of life. We found that grunt production was highly flexible occurring in positive, neutral and negative circumstances, as already shown in human infants. We also found acoustic variants of grunts produced in different affective contexts, suggesting gradation within this vocal category. By contrast, the second most common call type of infant chimpanzees, the whimpers, was produced in only one affective context in line with standard models of nonhuman primate vocal behavior.

However, little is known about how individuals integrate this information to take decisions and control their movements. Here, we combine experiments with computational and robotic approaches to investigate the impact of different strategies for a fish to interact with its neighbors on collective swimming in groups of rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus). By means of a data-based agent model describing the interactions between pairs of H. rhodostomus (Calovi et al., 2018), we show that the simple addition of the pairwise interactions with two neighbors quantitatively reproduces the collective behavior observed in groups of five fish. Increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the simulation results. Remarkably, we find that groups remain cohesive and polarized even when each agent only interacts with only one of its neighbors: the one that has the strongest contribution to the heading variation of the focal agent. However, group cohesion is lost when each agent only interacts with its nearest neighbor. We then investigate by means of a swarm robotic platform the collective motion in groups of five robots. Our platform combines the implementation of the fish behavioral model and an engineering-minded control system to deal with real-world physical constraints. We find that swarms of robots are able to reproduce the behavioral patterns observed in groups of five fish when each robot only interacts with its neighbor having the strongest effect on its heading variation, whereas increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the group coordination. Overall, our results suggest that fish have to acquire only a minimal amount of information about their environment to coordinate their movements when swimming in groups.Author Summary How do fish combine and integrate information from multiple neighbors when swimming in a school? What is the minimum amount of information about their environment needed to coordinate their motion? To answer these questions, we combine experiments with computational and robotic modeling to test several hypotheses about how individual fish could combine and integrate the information on the behavior of their neighbors when swimming in groups. Our research shows that, for both simulated agents and robots, using the information of two neighbors is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the collective motion patterns observed in groups of fish. Remarkably, our results also show that it is possible to obtain group cohesion and coherent collective motion over long periods of time even when individuals only interact with their most influential neighbor, that is, the one that exerts the most important effect on their heading variation.",1528,228,567,57.0

This paper complements the two-stage theory of causal induction proposed by Hattori and Oaksford (2007) with a computational analysis. We show that their dual-factor heuristic (DFH) model has a rational account as the square root of the index of (non-)independence under extreme rarity assumption, contrary to the criticism that the DFH model is non-normative (e.g., Lu et al., 2008). We introduce a model that considers the proportion of assumed-to-be rare instances (pARIs), which is the probability of biconditionals (according to several theories of compound conditionals) and can be seen as a simplified version of the DFH model. While being a single conditional probability, pARIs approximates the non-independence measure, the square of DFH. In reproducing the meta-analysis in Hattori and Oaksford (2007), we confirm that pARIs and DFH have the same level of descriptive adequacy, and that the two models have the highest fit among more than 40 models. Then, we critically examine the computer simulations which were central to the rational analysis in Hattori and Oaksford (2007). We point out two problems in their simluations: samples in some of the simulations being restricted to generative ones, and in-definite values of models because of the small samples. In the light of especially the latter problem of definability, pARIs shows higher applicability.",1379,226,403,29.0

In virtual audio systems, which aim to emulate these effects, non-individualized, generic HRTFs are typically used leading to an inaccurate perception of virtual sound location. Training has the potential to exploit the brain’s ability to adapt to these unfamiliar cues. In this study, three virtual sound localization training paradigms were evaluated; one provided simple visual positional confirmation of sound source location, a second introduced game design elements (“gamification”) and a final version additionally utilized head-tracking to provide listeners with experience of relative sound source motion (“active listening”). The results demonstrate a significant effect of training after a small number of short (12-minute) training sessions, which is retained across multiple days. Gamification alone had no significant effect on the efficacy of the training, but active listening resulted in a significantly greater improvements in localization accuracy. In general, improvements in virtual sound localization following training generalized to a second set of non-individualized HRTFs, although some HRTF-specific changes were observed in polar angle judgement for the active listening group. The implications of this on the putative mechanisms of the adaptation process are discussed.",3127,724,1176,18.0

Brandt Ryder",694166;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/694166,"The dynamics of social networks can determine the transmission of information, the spread of diseases, and the evolution of behavior. Despite this broad importance, a general framework for predicting social network stability has not been proposed. Here, we present longitudinal data on the social dynamics of a cooperative bird species, the wire-tailed manakin, to evaluate the potential causes of temporal network stability. We find that when partners interact less frequently, and when the breadth of social connectedness within the network increases, the social network is subsequently less stable. Social connectivity was also negatively associated with the temporal persistence of coalition partnerships on an annual timescale. This negative association between connectivity and stability was surprising, especially given that individual manakins who were more connected also had more stable partnerships. This apparent paradox arises from a within-individual behavioral trade-off between partnership quantity and quality. Crucially, this trade-off is easily masked by behavioral variation among individuals. Using a simulation, we show that these results are explained by a simple model that combines among-individual behavioral heterogeneity and reciprocity within the network. As social networks become more connected, individuals face a trade-off between partnership quantity and maintenance. This model also demonstrates how among-individual behavioral heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of natural societies, can improve social stability. Together, these findings provide unifying principles that are expected to govern diverse social systems.Significance Statement In animal societies, social partnerships form a dynamic network that can change over time. Why are some social network structures more stable than others? We addressed this question by studying a cooperative bird species in which social behavior is important for fitness, similar to humans. We found that stable social networks are characterized by more frequent interactions, but sparser connectivity throughout the network. Using a simulation, we show how both results can be explained by a simple model of reciprocity. These findings indicate that social stability is governed by a trade-off whereby individuals can either maintain a few high-quality partners, or increase partner number. This fundamental trade-off may govern the dynamics and stability of many societies, including in humans.",1204,267,422,21.0

Two generations of snails were reared in laboratory without or with exposure to predator cues. Then, escape behaviour was repeatedly assessed on adult snails in the presence or absence of predator cues.Both parental and developmental exposure to predator cues acted additively towards a lower average behavioural plasticity. At the individual level, developmental exposure induced higher differentiation in personality trait but not in behavioural plasticity while parental environment did not influence the between-individual differences.These results highlight that past environments can strongly influence behaviour at the population level and that they should be taken into consideration when investigating why individuals differ in behaviour.",786,90,295,24.0

In this paper, we investigated the existence of the eye regionalization by morphological, electrophysiological and behavioural experiments. Each ommatidium possesses five radially arranged retinular cells producing a square fused rhabdom by R1-R4 cells; the smaller R5 exist between R1 and R4. The size of R5 rhabdomere is largest in dorsal part and becomes gradually smaller in median and ventral part of the eye. Spectral-sensitivity measurements were recorded from either dorsal or ventral parts of the compound eye to clarify the chromatic difference. Results show that the dorsal part is green and UV-blue dichromatic, whereas the ventral part is UV (390 nm) with a substantial population of 450 nm receptors with the responses in the longer wavelength region. To evaluate the orienting behaviour of individuals, their eyes were black painted either in the dorsal or ventral part, under natural sky or a blue filter with or without the vision of the sun. Results show that animals painted on the dorsal part of their eyes tested under the screened sun were more dispersed and in certain cases their directions deflected than other groups of individuals. Furthermore, sandhoppers subjected to the obscuring of this area met in any case high difficulties in their directional choices.

However, it cannot always be observed directly. Here, we develop a general method to infer leading-following events from observational data if only the discrete appearance of individuals is recorded. Our method further allows to distinguish such events from local enhancement at the resource, such as swarming behavior in case of bats, which is another widespread way of transferring information among animals. To test our methodology, we analyze longitudinal data about the roosting behavior of Bechstein’s bats from two different colonies and different years. The detection of leading-following events allows us, in a second step, to construct social networks in which nodes represent individual bats and directed and weighted links the leading-following events. We analyze the topology of these networks on the level of the colony, to see whether all individuals participate in leading-following behavior. Further, based on the leading-following network we measure the importance of individuals in this leading-following behavior by calculating different centrality measures. We find that individuals can be consistently ranked regarding their influence on others. Moreover, we identify a small set of individuals that play a central role in leading other bats to roosts.

We analyze 9 empirical data sets about individualized leading-following (L/F) events, to infer rules that likely determine the formation of L/F pairs. To test these rules, we propose five models that differ regarding the empirical information taken into account to form L/F pairs: activity of a bat in exploring possible roosts, tendency to lead and to follow. The comparison with empirical data was done by constructing social networks from the observed L/F events, on which centralities were calculated to quantify the importance of individuals in these L/F networks. The centralities from the empirical network are then compared for statistical differences with the model-generated centralities obtained from 105 model realizations. We find that two models perform well in comparison with the empirical data: One model assumes an individual tendency to lead, but chooses followers at random. The other model assumes an individual tendency to follow and chooses leaders according to their overall activity. We note that neither individual preferences for specific individuals, nor other influences such as kinship or reciprocity, are taken into account to reproduce the empirical findings.",715,93,236,25.0

Our results reveal that the climbing perch did not show any significant preference or aversion to any of the stimulus shoals when unfamiliar monospecific shoals of tilapia, mixed-species shoals of tilapia and climbing perch that were divergent in the composition, or groups comprising only tilapia familiar to the subject fish for a duration of 30, 60, 90 or 120 days, were presented in opposition to a shoal with an equal number of unfamiliar conspecific individuals. No preference for isolated familiar individual tilapia was also observed against its unfamiliar counterpart or a conspecific individual.

While research on sexually dimorphic cognitionoften focuses on performance, it commonly overlooks how sexes diverge across multiple cognitive tasks (cognitive domains) and in behaviors associated with cognitive performance (cognitive style). We tested male and female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) in three cognitive tasks: associative learning (numerical discrimination), cognitive flexibility (detour task), and spatio-temporal learning (shuttlebox). We characterized statistical relationships between cognitive performances and cognitive style during the associative learning task with measures of anxiety, boldness, exploration, reaction time, and activity. We found sex differences in performance, cognitive style, and the relationships between cognitive domains. Females outperformed males in spatio-temporal learning task, while the sexes performed equally in associate learning and cognitive flexibility assays. Females (but not males) exhibited a ‘fast-exploratory’ cognitive style during associative learning trials. Meanwhile, only males showed a significant positive relationship between domains (associative learning and cognitive flexibility). We propose that these sexually dimorphic cognitive traits result from strong sexual conflict in this taxon; and emphasize the need to explore suites of sex-specific cognitive traits and broader comparative work examining sexual selection and cognition.Males and females perform at similar levels in associative learning and cognitive flexibility assays, but females tend to outperform males on a spatio-temporal learning task.Female performance in associative learning trials (numerical discrimination task) can be predicted by cognitive style behaviors (exploration, reaction time, and activity); whereas male performance cannot.Males, but not females, show a predictive relationship between associative learning and cognitive flexibility performance.Our results demonstrate that sex differences in cognition extend beyond performance into cognitive style and domain relationships, suggesting that investigations into animal personality and cognition require more comprehensive characterization.",746,125,316,24.0

Study 2 assessed the role of ovarian hormones in withdrawal by comparing the same measures in OVX rats that received vehicle, E2, or E2+progesterone prior to testing. Briefly, rats received a sham surgery or an ovariectomy procedure. Fifteen days later, rats were prepared with a pump that delivered nicotine for 14 days. On the test day, rats received saline or the nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine to precipitate withdrawal. Physical signs and anxiety-like behavior were assessed on the elevated plus maze (EPM) and light-dark transfer (LDT) tests. During withdrawal, intact females displayed greater anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone levels as compared to male and OVX rats. Females tested in estrus (when E2 is relatively low) displayed less anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone versus all other phases. Anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone were positively correlated with E2 and negatively correlated with progesterone. Intact females displaying high E2/low progesterone displayed greater anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone as compared to females displaying low E2/high progesterone.

The claimed mosquito repellency of 30.3 % due to Anti-Pic®, an electronic mosquito repellent, had failed to be confirmed in subsequent studies. However, studies on mosquito startle based on initial behavioural activities without an attractant yielded 34.12 % repellency elicited by the 10-34 kHz recorded sound of O. tormota. Other malaria intervention measures involving the use of chemicals have been impeded by the pathogen and vector resistance hence slowing down the rate of decline of malaria morbidity and mortality. The research thus focused on the analytical study of the African female A. gambiae s.s repellency evoked by the 10-34 kHz recorded animal sound of male mosquito, Anopheles gambiae and Delphinapterus leucas. Landing rates and behavioural startle responses of the mated female A. gambiae on food attractant evoked by the individual sound of the male mosquito, A. gambiae, O. tormota and D. leucas were determined and analysed. The male and female A. gambiae were bred and reared under controlled laboratory conditions of 60-80 % humidity, 25±2 °C temperature with equal light-darkness hour cycle in KEMRI, entomology laboratories. Isolation of the male and female mosquitoes from a swarm was based on physical features and affinity to blood meal. The sounds of O. tormota and D. leucas were acquired and the sound of the male A. gambiae were recorded from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) entomology laboratory, Kisumu. The sounds were filtered into 10-34 kHz frequency band and analysed using Avisoft-SAS LAB Pro version 5.2 and Raven Pro 1.5 software. The sound of O. tormota was also studied. A fighto-Y glass cage well designed into control, neutral and treatment chambers was used in the study. Both control and treatment chambers were connected to blood meal maintained at 38.60°C. The treatment cage was also connected to the source of sound and a swarm of 50 female mosquitoes into the neutral cage and observed for 1,200 s. The sounds of the A. gambiae, O. tormota and D. leucas yielded 2.10, 2.20 and 3.00 landings/minute respectively associated with adverse behaviour.

Sensitivity to the acute effects of initial drug exposure predicts later addiction vulnerability in both humans and animals, but the relationship of sensitivity to withdrawal from initial drug exposure and later drug use vulnerability is unclear. The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether the degree of anhedonia experienced during withdrawal from early opioid exposure predicts subsequent vulnerability to opioid addiction. Rats were first tested for withdrawal sensitivity following acute injections of morphine (i.e., “acute dependence”), measured as elevations in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds (anhedonia-like behavior) during naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal. Rats were then tested for addiction vulnerability using various measures of i.v. morphine self-administration (MSA) including acquisition, demand, extinction, and reinstatement induced by morphine, stress, and/or drug-associated cues. Greater naloxone-precipitated withdrawal across repeated morphine injections and greater peak spontaneous withdrawal severity following a single morphine injection were associated with lower addiction vulnerability on multiple MSA measures. Withdrawal-induced anhedonia predicted a wider range of MSA measures than did any individual measure of MSA itself. These data suggest that high anhedonia during withdrawal from initial opioid exposure is protective against subsequent opioid addiction vulnerability in rodents, thereby establishing one of the first behavioral measures to predict individual differences in opioid SA. This model promises to be useful for furthering our understanding of behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to opioid addiction.",738,321,259,49.0

Kiebel",838425;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/838425,"Selecting goals and successfully pursuing them in an uncertain and dynamic environment is an important aspect of human behaviour. In order to decide which goal to pursue at what point in time, one has to evaluate the consequences of one’s actions over future time steps by forward planning. However, when the goal is still temporally distant, detailed forward planning can be prohibitively costly. One way to select actions at minimal computational costs is to use heuristics. It is an open question how humans mix heuristics with forward planning to balance computational costs with goal reaching performance. To test a hypothesis about dynamic mixing of heuristics with forward planning, we used a novel stochastic sequential two-goal task. Comparing participants’ decisions with an optimal full planning agent, we found that at the early stages of goal-reaching sequences, in which both goals are temporally distant and planning complexity is high, on average 42% (SD = 19%) of participants’ choices deviated from the agent’s optimal choices. Only towards the end of the sequence, participant’s behaviour converged to near optimal performance. Subsequent model-based analyses showed that participants used heuristic preferences when the goal was temporally distant and switched to forward planning when the goal was close.Author summary When we pursue our goals, there is often a moment when we recognize that we did not make the progress that we hoped for. What should we do now? Persevere to achieve the original goal, or switch to another goal? Two features of real-world goal pursuit make these decisions particularly complex. First, goals can lie far into an unpredictable future and second, there are many potential goals to pursue. When potential goals are temporally distant, human decision makers cannot use an exhaustive planning strategy, rendering simpler rules of thumb more appropriate. An important question is how humans adjust the rule of thumb approach once they get closer to the goal. We addressed this question using a novel sequential two-goal task and analysed the choice data using a computational model which arbitrates between a rule of thumb and accurate planning. We found that participants’ decision making progressively improved as the goal came closer and that this improvement was most likely caused by participants starting to plan ahead.",671,73,197,34.0

Here, we examine two methods of introducing an interactive game to dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) to test whether they elicit differences in success rate, stress-related behavior, and autonomic regulation of the heart.Twenty-eight dogs living in shelters were given the opportunity to play with an interactive game that consists of four boxes with different opening mechanisms. Dogs were introduced to the interactive game in one of two ways: gradually vs hastily. Gradual introduction consisted of allowing the dog to first play a partial (2 out of 4 boxes) version of the game with a human experimenter demonstrating the opening mechanism of the boxes twice, followed by exposure to the complete game. Hasty introduction consisted of the same procedures but presented in a different order, with the complete game presented before the partial version. Dog behavior was obtained via video recordings and pre- and post-game mean HR, RMSSD, SDNN, RMSSD/SDNN ratio were assessed using R-R intervals obtained with a Polar heart rate monitor (RS800CX). Linear mixed effects analyses (LMM) were calculated for success and behavior component scores and for change from pre- to post-game period in HR &amp; HRV variables. In addition, HR and HRV parameters were analyzed with Pearson correlations.Dogs introduced to the game in a gradual manner had a significantly higher rate of success compared to dogs introduced in a hasty manner (LMM: p &lt; 0.001). Dogs introduced to the game gradually also displayed less stress related-behavior, e.g. displaying lower scores for the arousal (p &lt; 0.001) and displacement (p &lt; 0.001) components. Correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between HR and RMSSD during baseline in all dogs (pre-game, day 1: gradual: r = −0.52; hasty: r = −0.72) that gradually transformed into a strong positive correlation in the gradual introduction group (post-game, day 2: r = 0.78), whereas it remained negative over all evaluation periods in the hasty introduction group (post-game, day 2: r = −0.83).Overall, our findings on success rate, dog behavior, and HR/HRV suggest that the way a moderately difficult game is introduced plays a major role in determining how the experience of game play is perceived. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that gradual introduction including demonstration promotes an enjoyable experience characterized by greater likelihood of reward, less stress-related behavior, and a physiological profile that may involve activation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. We suggest that this may be a physiologic signature of successful achievement and that a learning experience in which skills are balanced against difficulty promote pleasant emotional states.",624,129,231,24.0

Internal energy stores and nutrient availability modulates the most apparent circadian clock mediated locmotor activity rhythm in Drosophila. Although previous studies unraveled the role of circadian clock in metabolism and activity rest rhythm, the precise pathway through which the circadian neuropeptidergic signaling regulates internal energy storage and the starvation-mediated increase in activity resembling foraging remains largely unclear. This study was aimed to elucidate the role of circadian neuropeptide, short neuropeptide F (sNPF) in triglyceride metabolism, starvation resistance and starvation-mediated increased locomotor activity in Drosophila. The results showed that snpf transcripts exhibits significant rhythmicity in wild type flies under 12:12 hour light-dark cycles (LD) and constant darkness (DD) whereas snpf transcript level in period null flies did not exhibit any significant rhythmicity under LD. Knockdown of sNPF in circadian clock neurons reduced the triglyceride level, starvation resistance and increased the starvation-mediated hyperactivity response after 24 hour of starvation. Further studies showed that knock down of sNPF receptors (sNPFR) expressed in insulin producing cells (IPC) increased the starvation resistance and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity response after 24 hour of starvation. Collectively, our results suggest that transcriptional oscillation of snpf mRNA is endogenously controlled by the circadian clock and elucidate the role of sNPF in modulating locomotor activity in accordance with the nutrient availability in Drosophila.",1626,419,543,26.0

The sensory and neural mechanisms underlying this navigational feat have been extensively documented, but their evolutionary origins remain unexplored. Among extant vertebrates, the teleost fish make up one of the most diverse and earliest-branching phylogenetic groups, and provide a powerful system to study the origins of vertebrate spatial processing. However, how freely-swimming teleost fish collect and compute metric spatial information underwater are unknown. Using the Picasso triggerfish, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, we investigate the functional and mechanistic basis of distance estimation in teleost fish for the first time. We show that a fish can learn and remember distance travelled with remarkable accuracy. By analysing swimming trajectories, we form hypotheses about how distance is represented in the teleost brain, and propose that distance may be encoded by dedicated neural structures in a similar way to terrestrial vertebrates. Finally, we begin exploring the sensory mechanisms underlying distance estimation in fish. Many walking animals use a step counter for odometry. By quantifying finbeat use during our distance task, we show that a functionally equivalent finbeat counter is unlikely to provide reliable and precise distance information in an aquatic environment.",1234,249,407,26.0

Madden",838078;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/838078,"The ability to inhibit prepotent actions towards rewards that are made inaccessible by transparent barriers has been considered to reflect capacities for inhibitory control (IC). Typically, subjects initially reach directly, and incorrectly, for the reward. With experience, subjects may inhibit this action and instead detour around barriers to access the reward. However, assays of IC are often measured across multiple trials, with the location of the reward remaining constant. Consequently, other cognitive processes, such as response learning (acquisition of a motor routine), may confound accurate assays of IC. We measured baseline IC capacities in pheasant chicks, Phasianus colchicus, using a transparent cylinder task. Birds were then divided into two training treatments, where they learned to access a reward placed behind a transparent barrier, but experienced differential reinforcement of a particular motor response. In the Stationary-Barrier treatment, the location of the barrier remained constant across trials. We therefore reinforced a fixed motor response, such as always go left, which birds could learn to aid their performance. Conversely, we alternated the location of the barrier across trials for birds in the Moving-Barrier treatment, and hence provided less reinforcement of their response learning. All birds then experienced a second presentation of the transparent cylinder task to assess whether differences in the training treatments influenced their subsequent capacities for IC. Birds in the Stationary-Barrier treatment showed a greater improvement in their subsequent IC performance after training compared to birds in the Moving-Barrier treatment. We therefore suggest that response learning aids IC performance on detour tasks. Consequently, non-target cognitive processes associated with different neural substrates appear to underlie performances on detour tasks, which may confound accurate assays of IC. Our findings question the construct validity of a commonly used paradigm that is widely considered to assess capacities for IC in humans and other animals.",499,72,209,25.0

Presented dataset allowed to track previous fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and enabled to combine their distribution with different bottom depth, thermal and ice conditions. The subsequent goal of this work was to reveal hot spots of salps location and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years.Results of our study revealed that the highest salp number was located mostly in the shallow shelf waters with ice-cover and lower temperature. In the studied area, Salpa thompsoni hot spot distributions have been located mostly around Elephant Island but also within islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the cold Bellingshausen Sea.

Pratt",836346;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/836346,"The nest structures built by social insects are complex group-level patterns that emerge from interactions among individuals following simple behavioral rules. The theory of complex systems predicts that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between variations in collective patterns and variation in individual behaviors; therefore, it is essential to know how actual behavior evolves to change pattern formation. Here we demonstrate that the evolutionary divergence of termite tunneling patterns is achieved by quantitative tuning of shared behavioral rules, rather than the acquisition of novel behaviors. We compared tunnel formation between two closely related species, Reticulitermes tibialis and Heterotermes aureus, and found that H. aureus builds more highly branched tunnels than R. tibialis. Our behavioral analysis and data-based modeling revealed that these species share the same behavioral repertoire, but a quantitative difference in the probability of sidewall excavation leads to diverse tunneling patterns. In contrast, we also found that Paraneotermes simplicicornis, which evolved tunneling independently, possesses a distinct behavioral repertoire, but shows convergence of branching patterns with R. tibialis. These results elucidate the complex relationship between individual behavior and group-level patterns; in some cases, distinct behavioral rules can produce similar group-level patterns, but in others, a common rule set can yield distinct patterns via parameter tuning. The evolutionary process of collective behavior is flexible and much more complex than we can infer from group-level patterns alone.",699,172,347,18.0

To address this, we used machine learning to analyse distress calls produced by wild infant chimpanzees. It enabled us to classify calls and examine them in relation to the external event triggering them and the distance to the intended receiver, the mother. In further steps, we tested whether the acoustic variants produced by infants predicted maternal responses. Our results demonstrated that, although infant chimpanzee distress calls were highly graded, they conveyed information about discrete events, which in turn guided maternal parenting decisions. We discuss these findings in light of one the most vexing problems in communication theory, the evolution of vocal flexibility in the human lineage.",873,80,283,26.0

A possible approach is to have the robots behave like sheepdogs. In this case, the robots would behave like a different species than the fish and would present different relevant behaviours. In this study, we explore different strategies that use biomimetic zebrafish behaviours. In past work, we have shown that robots biomimicking zebrafish can be socially integrated into zebrafish groups. We have also shown that a fish-like robot can modulate the rotation choice of zebrafish groups in a circular set-up. Here, we further study the modulation capabilities of such robots in a more complex set-up. To do this, we exploit zebrafish social behaviours we identified in previous studies. We first modulate collective departure by replicating the leadership mechanisms with the robot in a set-up composed of two rooms connected by a corridor. Then, we test different behavioural strategies to drive the fish groups towards a predefined target room. To drive the biohybrid groups towards a predefined choice, they have to adopt some specific fish-like behaviours. The first strategy is based on a single robot using the initiation behaviour. In this case, the robot keeps trying to initiate a group transition towards the target room. The second strategy is based on two robots, one initiating and one staying in the target room as a social attractant. The third strategy is based on a single robot behaving like a zebrafish but staying in the target room as a social attractant. The fourth strategy uses two robots behaving like zebrafish but staying in the target room. We conclude that robots can modulate zebrafish group behaviour by adopting strategies based on existing fish behaviours. Under these conditions, robots enable the testing of hypotheses about the behaviours of fish.",704,103,333,11.0
1083,A causal role for mouse superior colliculus in visual perceptual decision-making,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/835066v1,"Lupeng Wang, Kerry McAlonan, Sheridan Goldstein, Charles R. Gerfen, Richard J. Krauzlis",835066;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/835066,"The superior colliculus (SC) is arguably the most important visual structure in the mouse brain and is well-known for its involvement in innate responses to visual threats and prey items. In other species, the SC plays a central role in voluntary as well as innate visual functions, including crucial contributions to selective attention and perceptual decision-making. In the mouse, the possible role of the SC in voluntary visual choice behaviors has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse SC plays a causal role in visual perceptual decision-making by transiently inhibiting SC activity during an orientation-change detection task. First, unilateral SC inhibition induced spatially specific deficits in detection. Hit rates were reduced and reaction times increased for orientation changes in the contralateral but not ipsilateral visual field. Second, the deficits caused by SC inhibition were specific to a temporal epoch coincident with early visual burst responses in the SC. Inhibiting SC during this 100-ms period caused a contralateral detection deficit, whereas inhibition immediately before or after did not. Third, SC inhibition reduced visual detection sensitivity. Psychometric analysis revealed that inhibiting SC visual activity significantly increased detection thresholds for contralateral orientation changes. In addition, effects on detection thresholds and lapse rates caused by SC inhibition were larger in the presence of a competing visual stimulus, indicating a role for the mouse SC in visual target selection. Together, our results demonstrate that the mouse SC plays a crucial role in voluntary visual choice behaviors.Significance statement The mouse superior colliculus has become a popular model for studying the circuit organization and development of the visual system. Although the SC is a fundamental component of the visual pathways in mice, its role in visual perceptual decision-making is not clear. By investigating how temporally precise SC inhibition influenced behavioral performance during a visually guided orientation change detection task, we identified a 100-ms temporal epoch of SC visual activity that is crucial for the ability of mice to detect behaviorally relevant visual changes. In addition, we found that SC inhibition also caused deficits in visual target selection. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of the SC for visual perceptual choice behavior in the mouse.",1084,345,539,52.0

Goerlitz",817734;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/817734,"Active sensing animals perceive their surroundings by emitting probes of energy and analyzing how the environment modulates these probes. However, the probes of conspecifics can jam active sensing, which should cause problems for groups of active sensing animals. This problem was termed the cocktail party nightmare for echolocating bats: as bats listen for the faint returning echoes of their loud calls, these echoes will be masked by the loud calls of other close-by bats. Despite this problem, many bats echolocate in groups and roost socially. Here, we present a biologically parametrized framework to quantify echo detection in groups. Incorporating known properties of echolocation, psychoacoustics, spatial acoustics and group flight, we quantify how well bats flying in groups can detect each other despite jamming. A focal bat in the center of a group can detect neighbors for group sizes of up to 100 bats. With increasing group size, fewer and only the closest and frontal neighbors are detected. Neighbor detection is improved for longer call intervals, shorter call durations, denser groups and more variable flight and sonar beam directions. Our results provide the first quantification of the sensory input of echolocating bats in collective group flight, such as mating swarms or emergences. Our results further generate predictions on the sensory strategies bats may use to reduce jamming in the cocktail party nightmare. Lastly, we suggest that the spatially limited sensory field of echolocators leads to limited interactions within a group, so that collective behavior is achieved by following only nearest neighbors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Close-by active sensing animals may interfere with each other. We investigated if and what many echolocators fly in a group hear – can they detect each other after all? We modelled acoustic and physical properties in group echolocation to quantify neighbor detection probability as group size increases. Echolocating bats can detect at least one of their closest neighbors per call up to group sizes of even 100 bats. Call parameters such as call rate and call duration play a strong role in how much echolocators in a group interfere with each other. Even when many bats fly together, they are indeed able to detect at least their nearest frontal neighbors – and this prevents them from colliding into one another.",1169,366,377,23.0

However, inactivity does not necessarily reflect negative welfare and can even be a sign of positive welfare, for example in terms of relaxation. To date, knowledge of how to reliably differentiate between positive and negative states associated with inactivity is scarce and methods to identify different forms of inactivity are thus warranted. To this end, we developed an Inactivity Ethogram including detailed information on the postures of different body parts (Standing/Lying, Head, Ears, Eyes, Tail) for fattening cattle, a farm animal category often kept in barren environments. The Inactivity Ethogram was applied to Austrian Fleckvieh heifers from intensive, semi-intensive and pasture-based husbandry systems. Three farms per husbandry system were visited twice; once in the morning and once in the afternoon to cover most of the daylight hours with our observations. During each visit, 16 focal animals were continuously observed for 15 minutes each (96 heifers per husbandry system, 288 in total). Moreover, the focal animals’ groups were video recorded to later determine the inactivity level on the group level. Group level and focal animal data were analysed with (generalised) linear mixed-effect models with husbandry system as fixed effect and (group nested in) farm visit nested in farm as random effects. Husbandry system did not affect group level inactivity or the time the different postures were adopted (with the exception of asymmetrical ears, which were more prevalent in intensive than in semi-intensive than in pasture systems). In addition to the analysis of the time the single postures were observed for, simultaneous occurrences of postures of different body parts (Standing/Lying, Head, Ears and Eyes) were analysed using the machine learning algorithm cspade to provide insight into co-occurring postures of inactivity. Frequently co-occurring postures were generally similar between husbandry systems, but with subtle differences. The most frequently observed combination in intensive and semi-intensive systems was Lying with Head up, Ears backwards and Eyes open whereas in pasture systems it was Lying with Head up, ears low and eyes closed. To conclude, both the Inactivity Ethogram (including the description of detailed postures) and the machine learning algorithm cspade (for identifying frequently co-occurring posture combinations) are promising tools to understand how combinations of postures may be used to distinguish between different affective states associated with inactivity.",678,113,302,27.0

Here we present a compact description of the deforming wing kinematics of 36 manoeuvring Eristalis hoverflies, applying functional principal components analysis to Fourier series fits of the wingtip position and wing twist measured over 26,541 wingbeats. This analysis offers a high degree of data reduction, in addition to insight into the natural kinematic couplings. We used statistical resampling techniques to verify that the principal components were repeatable features of the data, and analysed their coefficient vectors to provide insight into the form of these natural couplings. Conceptually, the dominant principal components provide a natural set of control input variables that span the control input subspace of this species, but they can also be thought of as output states of the flight motor. This functional description of the wing kinematics is appropriate to modelling insect flight as a form of limit cycle control.",919,170,358,20.0

To understand the pathophysiology of injury-related dysfunction, we investigated the effects of a single muscle injury to the mylohyoid on oropharyngeal swallowing function in the rat. The mylohyoid protects the airway from food/liquid via hyolaryngeal elevation and plays an active role during both oral and pharyngeal swallowing. We hypothesized (1) that fibrosis to the mylohyoid alters swallowing bolus flow and licking patterns; (2) that injury to the mylohyoid changes normal activity of submental, laryngeal, and pharyngeal muscles during swallowing. A chilled cryoprobe was applied to the rat mylohyoid muscle to create a localized injury. After 1- and 2-weeks post-injury, swallowing bolus transit was assessed via videofluoroscopy and licking behavior via an electrical lick sensor. The motor activity of five swallow-related muscles were analyzed immediately after injury using electromyography (EMG). Comparisons were made pre- and post-injury. Fibrosis was confirmed in the mylohyoid at 2-weeks post-injury by measuring collagen content. One-week after injury, bolus size decreased, swallowing rate reduced, and licking patterns were altered. Immediately post-injury, there was a significant depression in mylohyoid and thyropharyngeus EMG amplitudes during swallowing. Our results demonstrated that injury to the mylohyoid is sufficient to cause changes in deglutition. These disruptions in oral and pharyngeal swallowing were detected prior to long-term fibrotic changes, including delays in tongue movement, alterations in bolus flow, and changes in sensorimotor function. Therefore, injuring a single important swallowing muscle can have dramatic clinical effects.",603,210,223,25.0

The non-medical reasons why greyhounds perform poorly at the racetrack are not well understood, but may include insufficient reinforcement for racing, or negative affective states associated with the context of racing. This study sought evidence for the affective states of greyhounds (n=525) at race meets and associations of those states with performance. It collected demographic, behavioural and performance data, along with infrared thermographic images of greyhounds at race-meets to investigate whether arousal influenced performance. It also collected behavioural data in the catching pen at the completion of races to examine possible evidence of frustration that may reflect sub-optimal behavioural reinforcement.Linear regression models were built to determine factors affecting greyhound performance. Increasing mean eye temperature after the race and increasing greyhound age both had a statistically significant, negative effect on performance. The start box number also had a significant effect, with boxes 4, 5 and 7 having a negative effect on performance. There was a significant effect of track on mean eye temperatures before and after the race, suggesting that some tracks may be inherently more stressful for greyhounds than others. Behaviours that may indicate frustration in the catching pen were extremely common at two tracks, but much less common at the third, where play objects in motion were used to draw greyhounds into the catching pen. The study provides evidence for the use of eye temperature in predicting performance, guidance for assessment of poor performance in greyhounds and suggested approaches to the management of frustration in racing greyhounds.",623,121,183,43.0

In an earlier study, we have shown that selection on timing of adult emergence behaviour in populations of Drosophila melanogaster leads to the co-evolution of temperature sensitivity of circadian clocks driving eclosion. In this study, we were interested in asking if temperature sensitivity of the locomotor activity rhythm has evolved in our populations with divergent timing of adult emergence rhythm, with the goal of understanding the extent of similarity (or lack of it) in circadian organisation between the two rhythms. We found that in response to simulated jetlag with temperature cycles, late chronotypes (populations selected for predominant emergence during dusk) indeed re-entrain faster than early chronotypes (populations selected for predominant emergence during dawn), thereby indicating enhanced sensitivity of the activity/rest clock to temperature cues in these stocks (entrainment is the synchronisation of internal rhythms to cyclic environmental time-cues). Additionally, we found that late chronotypes show higher plasticity of phases across regimes, day-to-day stability in phases and amplitude of entrainment, all indicative of enhanced temperature sensitive activity/rest rhythms.

Choosers’ preferences are shaped by recent events, early life experience and by the evolutionary history of its own species. To better understand the interaction between these factors, we studied mate choice in the female house mouse, Mus musculus. Females of one of the musculus subspecies, Mus musculus musculus, show preference for males of their own subspecies compared to males of the sibling subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus. Such an assortative preference is ecologically relevant at contact zones, where it contributes to the reproductive isolation of sympatric populations and can be reproduced in controlled laboratory conditions, but its origins are still under debate. Here, we show that female mouse mate choice depends on both early postnatal life experience and the order of prospective mates encountered as an adult and that these effects interact asymmetrically. Whereas females raised in their normal M. m. musculus environment display a robust assortative preference, females fostered in a M. m. domesticus family prefer the first male encountered, regardless of subspecies. Thus, early life experience of M. m. musculus females, when concordant with genetic self-identity, overrides sampling order effects, ensuring robust assortative choice. In the absence of this match between phylogeny and early life experience, first impression effects dominate mate choice.",817,98,238,10.0

Applied to high-resolution video recordings of the roundworm C. elegans, we discover a low-dimensional state space dominated by three sets of cyclic trajectories corresponding to the worm’s basic stereotyped motifs: forward, backward, and turning locomotion. In contrast to this broad stereotypy, we find variability in the presence of locally-unstable dynamics, and this unpredictability shows signatures of deterministic chaos: a collection of unstable periodic orbits together with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent. The full Lyapunov spectrum is symmetric with positive, chaotic exponents driving variability balanced by negative, dissipative exponents driving stereotypy.

Turtles face a trade-off between terrestrial and aquatic hearing in different acoustic environments throughout ontogeny. However, how chelonian hearing sensitivity changes throughout ontogeny is still unclear. To verify DPHS in turtles, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were compared using hearing thresholds and latencies in female red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) aged 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years, and the results showed hearing sensitivity bandwidths of approximately 200–1100, 200–1100, 200–1300, and 200–1400 Hz, respectively. The lowest threshold sensitivity was approximately 600□Hz. Below 600 Hz, ABR threshold decreased rapidly with increasing age (1 week to 1 year), with significant differences between age groups, but no significant difference between the 1- and 5-year age groups (stimulus frequency, 200–600 Hz). Above 600 Hz, ABR threshold was the lowest in the 5-year age group. These findings show that aging was accompanied by hearing sensitivity changes, suggesting rapid, frequency-segmented development during ontogeny. This variability in hearing sensitivity differs from that reported in other vertebrates, and allows adaptation to acoustically distinct environments throughout ontogeny. Our findings further elucidate the developmental patterns of the vertebrate auditory system.",512,132,166,14.0

Here, we investigate the effect of Wolbachia infection on host pre-imaginal learning in the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). We compare host-choice in Wolbachia-infected and uninfected adult female parasitoids after rearing them on two different Lepidopteran hosts, namely the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) or the grain moth Sitotroga cerealella (Lep.: Gelechiidae). We show that in T. brassicae, Wolbachia affect the pre-imaginal learning ability of female wasps. Wolbachia infected wasps do not show any host preference and easily switch hosts in the laboratory, while uninfected wasps significantly prefer to lay eggs on the host species they developed on. We discuss how the facilitation of a generalist strategy by Wolbachia may allow T. brassicae to escape intraspecific competition with their uninfected counterparts, and may have important evolutionary consequences for the host and its symbionts.",789,135,313,32.0

Utilising a diurnal larval zebrafish model, we identified instant, non-image-forming (NIF) responses to short-wavelength violet light (~420nm), which are activated only during light exposure, and are reminiscent of alertness, including increased heart rate, enhanced locomotor activity, and pectoral fin beating (for increased oxygen supply). We further determined that these responses are driven by sympathetic neuronal circuits and depend on the zebrafish melanopsin homologue Opn4a. We also found that these responses can be modulated by the sleep-regulatory hormone melatonin, but that melatonin is not essential.

Previous research on the subject lacks companion dog-focused research, investigation of the entire range of aversive-based techniques (beyond shock-collars), objective measures of welfare, and long-term welfare studies. The aim of the present study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the short- and long-term effects of aversive- and reward-based training methods on companion dog welfare. Ninety-two companion dogs were recruited from three reward-based (Group Reward, n=42) and four aversive-based (Group Aversive, n=50) dog training schools. For the short-term welfare assessment, dogs were video recorded for three training sessions and six saliva samples were collected, three at home (baseline levels) and three after the training sessions (post-training levels). Video recordings were then used to examine the frequency of stress-related behaviors (e.g., lip lick, yawn) and the overall behavioral state of the dog (e.g., tense, relaxed), and saliva samples were analyzed for cortisol concentration. For the long-term welfare assessment, dogs performed a cognitive bias task. Dogs from Group Aversive displayed more stress-related behaviors, spent more time in tense and low behavioral states and more time panting during the training sessions, showed higher elevations in cortisol levels after training and were more ‘pessimistic’ in the cognitive bias task than dogs from Group Reward.

Most studies focus on the relationship between adults, overlooking another important stakeholder in the game – the juvenile offspring. Recent studies from various social species show that not only the queen, but also the brood regulates reproductive division of labor between females, but how the two coordinate to maintain reproductive monopoly remained unexplored.Our study aims at disentangling the roles of the brood and the queen in regulating worker reproduction in primitively eusocial bees. We examined the effects induced by the brood and queen, separately and together, on the behavioral, physiological and brain gene expression of Bombus impatiens workers. We found that young larvae induce a releaser effect in workers, decreasing egg laying and aggressive behaviors, while the queen induces both releaser and primer effects, modifying worker aggressive and egg laying behavior and reproductive physiology. The expression of reproduction- and aggression-related genes was altered in the presence of both queen and brood, but the effect was stronger or the same in the presence of the queen.We identified two types of interactions between the queen and the brood in regulating worker reproduction: (1) synergistic interactions regulating worker physiology, where the combined effect of the queen and the brood was greater than each of them separately; (2) additive interactions regulating worker behavior, where the combined effects of the queen and the brood are the gross sum of their separated effects. In these interactions the brood acted in a manner similar to the queen but to a much smaller extent and improved the quality of the effect induced by the queen. Our results suggest that the queen and the brood of primitively eusocial bees coordinate synergistically, additively, and sometimes even redundantly to regulate worker behavior and reproduction, and the interaction between them exists in multiple regulatory levels.",950,164,322,27.0

The rice pest insect, the purple stem borer, Sesamia inferens (Walker) is currently reported to be expanding their northern distributions and causing damage to summer maize in Xinxiang, China. However, their method of coping with the lower temperature in the new northern breeding area in winter is largely unknown. This paper investigates the overwinter site of S. inferens, and identifies the cold hardiness of larvae collected from a new breeding area in winter and explores a potential distribution based on low temperature threshold and on species distribution model, MaxEnt. The results show that the overwintering location of the S. inferens population is more likely to be underground with increasing latitude and,in the north, with the temperature decreasing, the larvae gradually moved down the corn stalk and drilled completely underground by February 18th. Those who were still above ground were all winterkilled. The cold hardiness test shows the species is a moderate freeze-tolerant one, and Supercooling Points (SCP), Freezing Points (FP) and mortality rate during the middle of winter (January, SCP: −7.653, FP: −6.596) were significantly lower than early winter (October) or late winter (March). Distribution in the new expansion area was predicted and the survival probability area was below N 35° for the Air Lower Lethal Temperature (ALLT50) and below N 40° for the Underground Lower Lethal Temperature (ULLT50), The suitable habitat areas for S. inferens with MaxEnt were also below N 40°. This study suggests the overwinter strategies have led to the colonization of up to a five degree more northerly overwintering latitude. This behavior of S. inferens could help maize producers to propose a control method to increase pest mortality by extracting the maize stubble after harvest.",581,61,270,30.0

Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which males exhibit plasticity to different social cues remains poorly understood. Here, we show that SIFa modulates the neural circuitry for both LMD and SMD. Neuropeptide-to-neuropeptide communication, so called ‘neuropeptide relay’ plays a key role to mediate this control. We identified that 7 neuropeptides expressed in SIFa Receptor-positive cells are functionally important to regulate either LMD and/or SMD.

Here we tested whether corticosterone, a hormone known to be upregulated in hosts exposed to parasitism, also mediates one of the most frequent host defences – the rejection of foreign eggs. We experimentally reduced corticosterone levels in free-living brood parasite hosts, American robins Turdus migratorius, using mitotane and found that the likelihood of model egg rejection was significantly lower in the mitotane-treated birds relative to the sham-treated birds. These results demonstrate a causal link between glucocorticoids and egg rejection in hosts of avian brood parasites, but the physiological and sensory-cognitive pathways that regulate this effect remain unknown.",637,124,240,13.0

To investigate how heritable differences in individual learning affect a colony’s collective ability to locate and choose among different quality food resources, we develop an agent based model and test its predictions using two genetic lines of honey bees, selected for differences in their learning behavior. Here we show that, paradoxically, colonies containing individuals that are better at learning to ignore unrewarding stimuli are worse at choosing the highest quality resource at the collective level.

These mechanisms take place at the individual scale and they can be described as a combination of pairwise interactions between individuals and interactions between these individuals and the physical obstacles in the environment. Thanks to the development of novel tracking techniques that provide large and accurate data sets, the main characteristics of individual and collective behavioural patterns can be quantified with an unprecedented level of precision. However, in a large number of works, social interactions are usually described by force map methods that only have a limited capacity of explanation and prediction, being rarely suitable for a direct implementation in a concise and explicit mathematical model. Here, we present a general method to extract the interactions between individuals that are involved in the coordination of collective movements in groups of organisms. We then apply this method to characterize social interactions in two species of shoaling fish, the rummynose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio), which both present a burst-and-coast motion.

Although the deletion spans a number of genes, the contribution of each of these to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) is not known. To investigate the effect of individual genes within this interval on the pathophysiology associated with the deletion, we analyzed their role in sleep, a behavior affected in virtually all psychiatric disorders, including the 22q11.2 DS. We identified the gene LZTR1 (night owl, nowl) as a regulator of sleep in Drosophila. Neuronal loss of nowl causes short and fragmented sleep, especially during the night. In humans, LZTR1 has been associated with Ras-dependent neurological diseases also caused by Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) deficiency. We show that Nf1 loss leads to a night-time sleep phenotype nearly identical to that of nowl loss, and that nowl negatively regulates Ras and interacts with Nf1 in sleep regulation. We also show that nowl is required for metabolic homeostasis, suggesting that LZTR1 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to obesity associated with the 22q11.2 DS. Furthermore, knockdown of nowl or Nf1 in GABA-responsive sleep-promoting neurons elicits the sleep-fragmentation phenotype, and this defect can be rescued by increased GABAA receptor signaling, indicating that Nowl promotes sleep by decreasing the excitability of GABA-responsive wake-driving neurons. Our results suggest that nowl/LZTR1 may be a conserved regulator of GABA signaling and sleep that contributes to the 22q11.2 DS.",1000,234,299,42.0

Gershman",644534;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/644534,"Bayesian theories of cognition assume that people can integrate probabilities rationally. However, several empirical findings contradict this proposition: human probabilistic inferences are prone to systematic deviations from optimality. Puzzlingly, these deviations sometimes go in opposite directions. Whereas some studies suggest that people under-react to prior probabilities (base rate neglect), other studies find that people under-react to the likelihood of the data (conservatism). We argue that these deviations arise because the human brain does not rely solely on a general-purpose mechanism for approximating Bayesian inference that is invariant across queries. Instead, the brain is equipped with a recognition model that maps queries to probability distributions. The parameters of this recognition model are optimized to get the output as close as possible, on average, to the true posterior. Because of our limited computational resources, the recognition model will allocate its resources so as to be more accurate for high probability queries than for low probability queries. By adapting to the query distribution, the recognition model “learns to infer.” We show that this theory can explain why and when people under-react to the data or the prior, and a new experiment demonstrates that these two forms of under-reaction can be systematically controlled by manipulating the query distribution. The theory also explains a range of related phenomena: memory effects, belief bias, and the structure of response variability in probabilistic reasoning. We also discuss how the theory can be integrated with prior sampling-based accounts of approximate inference.",4260,442,3870,83.0

The importance of social rank suggests that the process by which juveniles come to establish their position in the social hierarchy is a critical component of social development. Here, we use the highly predictable process of rank acquisition in spotted hyenas to study the consequences of variation in rank acquisition in early life. In spotted hyenas, rank is ‘inherited’ through a learning process called ‘maternal rank inheritance.’ This pattern is highly predictable: ~80% of juveniles acquire the exact rank predicted by the rules of maternal rank inheritance. This predictable nature of rank acquisition in these societies allows the process of rank acquisition to be studied independently from the ultimate rank that each juvenile attains. In this study, we use a novel application of the Elo-rating method to calculate each juvenile’s deviation from expected pattern of maternal rank inheritance during development. Despite variability in rank acquisition in juveniles, most of these juveniles come to attain the exact rank expected of them according to the rules of maternal rank inheritance. Nevertheless, we find that transient variation in rank acquisition in early life predicts long term fitness consequences for these individuals: juveniles ‘underperforming’ their expected ranks show reduced survival and lower lifetime reproductive success than better-performing peers. Finally, we present evidence that this variability in rank acquisition in early life represents a source of early life adversity, and that multiple sources of early life adversity have cumulative, but not compounding, effects on fitness.",771,150,244,17.0

Among trials of the same sensory difficulty within a block of fixed decision strategy, humans and monkeys are widely reported to make more errors in the individual trials with longer reaction times. This finding has posed a challenge for the drift-diffusion model of sensory decision-making, which in its basic form predicts that errors and correct responses should have the same reaction time distributions. We previously reported that rats also violate this model prediction, but in the opposite direction: for rats, motion discrimination accuracy was highest in the trials with the longest reaction times. To rule out task differences as the cause of our divergent finding in rats, the present study tested humans and rats using the same task and analyzed their data identically. We confirmed that rats’ accuracy increased with reaction time, whereas humans’ accuracy decreased with reaction time in the same task.

Wilson, L. Hejtmánek, E. M. Ziskin, A. D. Ekstrom",809012;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/809012,"Path integration is thought to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive cues yet most studies in humans involve primarily visual input, providing limited insight into their contributions. We developed a paradigm involving walking in an omnidirectional treadmill in which participants were guided on two legs of a triangle and then found their back way to origin. In Experiment 1, we tested a range of different triangle types while keeping distance relatively constant to determine the influence of spatial geometry. Participants overshot the angle they needed to turn and undershot the distance they needed to walk, with no consistent effect of triangle type. In Experiment 2, we manipulated distance while keeping angle relatively constant to determine how path integration operated over both shorter and longer distances. Participants underestimated the distance they needed to walk to the origin, with error increasing as a function of the walked distance. To attempt to account for our findings, we developed computational models involving vector addition, the second of which included terms for the influence of past trials on the current one. We compared against a previously developed model of human path integration, the Encoding Error model. We found that the vector addition models captured the tendency of participants to under-encode guided legs of the triangles and an influence of past trials on current trials. Together, our findings expand our understanding of body-based contributions to human path integration, further suggesting the value of vector addition models in understanding these important components of human navigation.Author Summary How do we remember where we have been? One important mechanism for doing so is called path integration, which refers to the ability to track one’s position in space with only self-motion cues. By tracking the direction and distance we have walked, we can create a mental arrow from the current location to the origin, termed the homing vector. Previous studies have shown that the homing vector is subject to systematic distortions depending on previously experienced paths, yet what influences these patterns of errors, particularly in humans, remains uncertain. In this study, we compare two models of path integration based on participants walking two legs of a triangle without vision and then completing the third leg based on their estimate of the homing vector. We found no effect of triangle shape on systematic errors, while path length scaled the systematic errors logarithmically, similar to Weber-Fechner law. While we show that both models captured participant’s behavior, a model based on vector addition best captured the patterns of error in the homing vector. Our study therefore has important implications for how humans track their location, suggesting that vector-based models provide a reasonable and simple explanation for how we do so.",822,71,346,61.0

Effective chunking during reading facilitates disambiguation and enhances efficiency for comprehension. However, the mechanisms of chunking remain elusive, especially in reading given that information arrives simultaneously yet the written systems may not have explicit cues for labeling boundaries such as Chinese. What are the mechanisms of chunking operation that mediates the reading of the text that normally contains hierarchical information? We investigated this question by manipulating the lexical status of the chunks at distinct levels of grain-size in four-character Chinese strings, including the two-character local chunk and four-character global chunk. Participants were asked to make lexical decision on these strings in a behavioral experiment, followed by a passive reading task when their electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that the lexical decision time of lexicalized two-character local chunks was influenced by the lexical status of four-character global chunk, but not vice versa, which indicated that the processing of global chunks possessed priority over the local chunks. The EEG results revealed that familiar lexical chunks were detected simultaneously at both levels and further processed in a different temporal order -- the onset of lexical access for the global chunks was earlier than that of local chunks. These consistent behavioral and EEG results suggest that chunking in reading occurs at multiple levels via a two-stage operation -- simultaneous detection and global-first recognition.Significance Statement The learners of a new language often read word by word. But why can proficient readers read multiple words at a time? The current study investigates how we efficiently segment a complicate text into smaller pieces and how we process these pieces. Participants read Chinese strings with different structures while their key-press responses and brain EEG signals were recorded. We found that texts were quickly (about 100 ms from their occurrences) segmented to varied sizes of pieces, and larger pieces were then processed earlier than small pieces. Our results suggest that readers can use existing knowledge to efficiently segment and process written information.",743,172,234,33.0

In this study we tested the effect of exendin-4 on cue-induced and drug-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking behavior in rats.Methods This study consisted of three phases: In Phase 1, 55 male Sprague-Dawley rats had 15 daily pairings of saccharin with heroin self-administration. In Phase 2, rats experienced a 16-day home cage abstinence period and daily treatment with vehicle or exendin-4. On day 17, an extinction/reinstatement test was performed to assess drug seeking. In Phase 3, rats experienced 9 days of extinction followed by a reinstatement only test. Finally, expression of mRNA for various receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) was measured using RTqPCR.Results In Phase 1, rats that avoided intake of the heroin-paired saccharin cue exhibited shorter latency to obtain the first infusion. In Phase 2, treatment with exendin-4 decreased cue-induced, but not drug-induced heroin seeking. In Phase 3, saccharin avoiders previously treated with exendin-4 increased acceptance of saccharin, and 1-hour pretreatment with Exendin-4 abolished drug-induced heroin seeking. Finally, exendin-4 treatment increased expression of mRNA for the Orexin 1 receptor (OX1) in the NAcS, but did not affect expression of dopamine D2 receptors, GLP-1 receptors, or leptin receptors in this same structure.Conclusion Exendin-4 reduced cue- and drug-induced heroin seeking and increased acceptance of the drug-associated saccharin cue.

At the same time, the importance of the 3Rs to minimize suffering during experiments encouraged the development of environmental enrichment programs. Among them, tools for feeding and foraging are central. However, it remains unclear whether the behavioral enrichment tools are used by the animals only for feeding and to satisfy hunger (and hence for survival), or whether these feeding tools serve also as behavioral enrichment in itself (namely, the animals enjoy it per-se). To answer this, we designed a novel dispenser method – that requires significant yet reasonable energetic effort to obtain food - and tested food consumption via the dispenser compared to free-access, namely that did not require any effort on the animal side. We found that primates consumed food from both the dispenser and when presented in free-access, and importantly, that the consumption via the dispenser was in correlation with the consumption in free-access. This was similar across different subjects, different times during the day, and different types of food. We suggest that monkeys can benefit from using the dispenser for food consumption, but also benefit from it for play (i.e. as behavioral enrichment in itself). Such an approach allows non-human-primates to preserve their natural food procurement activities.",903,130,228,12.0

Flight direction of the bee was recorded by monitoring the horizontal movement of its abdomen, which was strongly anti-correlated with its torque. When the e-vector orientation of the polarized light was rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, the bee responded with periodic right-and-left abdominal movements; however, the bee did not show any clear periodic movement under the static e-vector or depolarized stimulus. The steering frequency of the bee was well coordinated with the e-vector rotation frequency of the stimulus, indicating that the flying bee oriented itself to a certain e-vector orientation, i.e., exhibited polarotaxis. The percentage of bees exhibiting clear polarotaxis was much smaller under the fast stimulus (3.6 ° s-1) compared with that of the slow stimulus (0.9 or 1.8 ° s-1). The bee did not demonstrate any polarotactic behavior after the dorsal rim region of its eyes, which mediates insect polarization vision in general, was bilaterally covered with black paint. The bees demonstrated a high preference for e-vector orientations between 120 to 180°. Each bee exhibited similar e-vector preferences under clockwise and counterclockwise stimuli, indicating that each bee has its own e-vector preference, which probably depends on the bee’s previous foraging experience. Our results strongly suggest that the flying honeybees utilize the e-vector information from the skylight to deduce their heading orientation for navigation.Summary statement Tethered flying bees exhibited polarotaxis under a zenithal rotating e-vector stimulus, in which their right-and-left abdominal movements were coincident with the rotation of the stimulus.",625,332,315,28.0

In the present study, we examined the relationships among the timing of territory establishment, the pattern of song learning and territorial success in a sedentary population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Males in this population show high song sharing within neighborhoods derving from their learning most of their songs from neighboring males. These shared songs are preferentially used in interactions with neighbors. Males also show significant variation in the timing of territory establishment, ranging from their first summer until the next spring. Using a three-year dataset, we found that the timing of territory establishment did not systematically affect the composition of the song repertoire of the tutee: early establishers and late establishers learned equally as much from their primary tutors, and had a similar number of tutors and repertoire size. Timing of territory establishment also did not have an effect on subsequent survival on territory. Therefore, the song learning program of song sparrows seems versatile enough to lead to high song sharing even for birds that establish territories relatively late.",772,233,211,25.0

If relief from pain is provided in a specific location, place learning is the mechanism used to pinpoint that location in space. Little is known about how physiological and non-directly damaging stimuli can alter visual-based searching behaviour in animals. Here we show how the optogenetically-induced activation of bitter-sensing neurons urges Drosophila melanogaster to seek relief from bitter taste stimulation and that this distressful, but ecologically relevant stimulus, innately wired to the threat of intoxication, is sufficient to elicit pain-relief-like behavioural responses. Specifically, freely walking flies inside an open circular arena are trained to seek relief from the unpleasant stimulation by searching for a safe area alternatively positioned in the proximity of a pair of identical, diametrically opposed, visual markers. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, under this paradigm flies develop visual place learning manifested by their seeking relief in the zone associated with bitter relief during the last trial of training, even when exposed to constant bitter stimulation with no relief provided. An important implication is that this form of learning does not lead to operant conditioning generalization. We further propose that kinematic indexes, such as the spatially-specific reduction of locomotor velocity, may provide immediate evidence of relief-based place learning and spatial memory.",968,419,359,28.0

Previous research suggests the these jays can learn a preference toward functional tools – objects allowing to obtain a food reward placed inside an apparatus – according to their density (Cheke et al., 2011). However, it is not yet known whether they can also select functional tools (tool selectivity) according to other physical properties such as size and shape, and use different kinds of tools to solve a similar task. Here we conducted three object-dropping experiments aimed at exploring these abilities in Eurasian jays. In Experiment 1, jays tended to select large stones as tools irrespective of the diameter of the apparatus. However, jays progressively developed a preference for the small tool, which was functional with both the wide and the narrow apparatuses. In Experiment 2, only vertically-oriented long stones could fit into the narrow apparatus, whereas both long and round stones were functional with the wide apparatus. Jays showed a preference for the long stone and, with the narrow apparatus, tended to achieve the correct manipulation after one or more unsuccessful attempts. In Experiment 3, jays were able to use sticks and adopt a novel technique on the same object-dropping apparatus, thus providing the first evidence that Eurasian jays can use sticks as tools. Taken together, these results indicate that Eurasian jays may have limited tool selectivity abilities but nonetheless can use different kinds of tools to solve similar tasks.",979,235,278,32.0

Tsetse flies are K-strategist species with the deposition of a single larva at 10 days intervals in specific sites. As larviposition site selection will strongly impact reproductive success, it is obvious that the selection of larviposition sites is not random and is under strong selective processes, probably mediated by specific cues as suggested by the existence of an aggregation factor in the Morsitans and Fusca groups. This study aimed to highlight the existence of an aggregation effect in the Palpalis group and to test for its chemical nature. We studied the larviposition site selection of Glossina palpalis gambiensis according to the presence of conspecific and heterospecific larvae buried in substrates in different settings. Three sets of experiments were performed with either individual or grouped (n = 50) gravid females, and with physical access to substrate or not. In both individual and grouped larviposition experiments, females selected significantly more often trays conditioned by larvae (P&lt;0.005), either conspecific or heterospecific even in the absence of physical contact with the substrate. These results highlight the first evidence for larviposition site selection mediated by volatile semiochemicals of larval origin in Glossina palpalis gambiensis.

In this species, males defend territories against conspecific males and respond aggressively to female brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), a brood parasite that commonly lays eggs in blackbird nests. Both conspecific songs and parasitic calls elicited aggressive responses from focal subjects and caused a downregulation in genes associated with immune system response, relative to control calls of a second, harmless heterospecific species. In turn, only the conspecific song treatment elicited an increase in singing behavior and an upregulation of genes associated with metabolic processes relative to the two heterospecific calls.

Moita",800714;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/800714,"SUMMARYSocial cues of threat are widely reported [1–3], whether actively produced to trigger responses in others, such as the emission of alarm calls, or by-products of an encounter with a predator, like the defensive behaviors themselves, such as an escape flight [4–14]. Although the recognition of social alarm cues is often innate [15–17], in some instances it requires experience to trigger defensive responses [4,7]. One mechanism proposed for how learning from self-experience contributes to social behavior is that of auto-conditioning, whereby subjects learn to associate their own behaviors with the relevant trigger events. Through this process the same behaviors, now displayed by others, gain meaning. [18,19 but see: 20]. Although it has been shown that only animals with prior experience with shock display observational freezing [21–25] suggesting that auto-conditioning could mediate this process, evidence for this hypothesis was lacking. Previously we found that when a rat freezes, the silence that results from immobility triggers observational freezing in its cage-mate, provided the cage-mate had experienced shocks before [24]. Hence, in our study auto-conditioning would correspond to rats learning to associate shock with their own response to it – freezing. Using a combination of behavioral and optogenetic manipulations, here we show that freezing becomes an alarm cue by a direct association with shock. Our work shows that auto-conditioning can indeed modulate social interactions, expanding the repertoire of cues that mediate social information exchange, providing a framework to study how the neural circuits involved in the self-experience of defensive behaviors overlap with the ones involved in socially triggered defensive behaviors.",1025,131,611,30.0

However, scattered evidence implies that stopping behavior is entangled with simpler automatic stimulus-response mechanisms. Here we operationalize this idea by merging the latest conceptualization of saccadic countermanding with a neural network model of visuo-oculomotor behavior that integrates bottom-up and top-down drives. This model accounts for all fundamental qualitative and quantitative features of saccadic countermanding, including neuronal activity. Importantly, it does so by using the same architecture and parameters as basic visually guided behavior and automatic stimulus-driven interference. Using simulations and new data, we compare the temporal dynamics of saccade countermanding with that of saccadic inhibition (SI), a hallmark effect thought to reflect automatic competition within saccade planning areas. We demonstrate how SI accounts for a large proportion of the saccade countermanding process when using visual signals. We conclude that top-down inhibition acts later, piggy-backing on the quicker automatic inhibition. This conceptualization fully accounts for the known effects of signal features and response modalities traditionally used across the countermanding literature. Moreover, it casts different light on the concept of top-down inhibition, its timing and neural underpinning, as well as the interpretation of stop-signal reaction time, the main behavioral measure in the countermanding literature.",1817,399,539,61.0

As different baboon species exhibit considerable variation in all of these factors, they constitute an excellent test case to resolve this debate.Materials and Methods We analyzed group departures and progressions of Guinea baboons, Papio papio, in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal. Guinea baboons live in a multi-level society with strong male bonds and a lack of a clear dominance hierarchy between males.Results Two-thirds of departures were initiated by adult males, and one third by adult females. Although initiators were more likely to signal than followers, signaling did not affect the initiation success. During group progression, males that were not affiliated with females were predominantly found in the front, while affiliated males, females and young were observed more frequently closer to the center of the group, and no preferences for rear positions. Overall, affiliated subjects were more likely to depart and travel together.Discussion The group departures in Guinea baboons differed strikingly from the elaborate ‘negotiation’ behaviors among male hamadryas baboons, Papio hamadryas. We did not observe that specific individuals dominated the group coordination. Neither social organization, variation in despotism, nor resource distribution alone explain variation between species.

To test the hypothesis that reduced feeding in the absence of the GMF leads to a decrease of N. lugens body weight, we compared magnetic responses in feeding behavior, glucose levels, and expression of magnetoreception- and appetite-related genes in brown planthopper nymphs exposed to either a near-zero magnetic field (NZMF, i.e., GMF absence) or typical GMF conditions. In addition to observing the expected responses in the expression of the potential magnetosensor cryptochromes, the food intake of 5th instar nymphs was significantly reduced in insects reared in the absence of GMF. Insects that exhibited reduced feeding reared in the absence of the GMF also had higher glucose levels which is associated with food aversion. Expression patterns of appetite-related neuropeptide genes were also altered in the absence of GMF in a manner consistent with diminishing appetite. These findings support the hypothesis that strong changes in GMF intensity can affect insect feeding behavior and underlying regulatory processes. Our results provide further evidence that magnetoreception and regulatory responses to GMF changes can affect a wide variety of biological processes.",1215,240,448,26.0

Most studies assume that an animal’s “optimal” foraging route is linear, ignoring the role the energy landscape can play in influencing movement efficiency. Our objective was to investigate whether landscape features that affect movement costs; topographic variation, and super and substrate, influence the movement of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in a rugged, montane environment. We tested for route re-use and preferential use of human-made trails and ridge tops using 14 months of focal follow data from 14 individuals and maps of established chimpanzee trails. Chimpanzees travelled on human-made trails significantly more than expected and showed weak preference for use of ridge tops for travel. Line density analysis demonstrated route re-use in chimpanzees and uncovered a network of high-use routes across their range. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically demonstrate route re-use and preferential use of human-made trails for travel by chimpanzees. We discuss the energetic and cognitive benefits of trail use and the implications for chimpanzee sociality. By applying the latest GIS analytical techniques to fine-scale movement data, this study demonstrates the importance of incorporating landscape features in predictive animal movement models.",3129,192,392,20.0

Grueter",793562;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/793562,"SummaryWhile the ability of naturally ranging animals to recall the location of food resources and use straight-line routes between them has been demonstrated in several studies, it is not known whether animals can use knowledge of their physical landscape to plan least-cost routes. This ability is likely to be particularly important for animals living in highly variable energy landscapes, where movement costs are exacerbated. Here, we used least-cost modelling to investigate whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in a rugged, montane environment use advanced cognitive skills to plan energy efficient routes. We used a subset of chimpanzee movement segments together with the available laboratory measurements of chimpanzee energy expenditure to assign movement ‘costs’ which were incorporated in an anisotropic least-cost model and straight-line null model. The least-cost model performed better than the straight-line model across all parameters, and linear mixed modelling showed a strong relationship between the cost of observed chimpanzee travel and predicted least-cost routes. To our knowledge, our study provides the first example of spatial memory for landscape and the ability to plan least-cost routes in non-human animals. These cognitive abilities may be a key trait that have enabled chimpanzees to maintain their energy balance in a low-resource environment. Our findings provide a further example of how the advanced cognitive complexity of hominids have facilitated their adaptation to a variety of environmental conditions and lead us to hypothesise that landscape complexity may play a role in shaping cognition.",3245,740,357,20.0

Regarding ketamine effects on anxiety, there is a widespread discordance among pre-clinical studies. To address this issue, the present study reviewed the literature (electronic database MEDLINE) to summarize the profile of ketamine effects in animal tests of anxiety/fear. We found that ketamine anxiety/fear-related effects may depend on the anxiety paradigm, schedule of ketamine administration and tested species. Moreover, there was no report of ketamine effects in animal tests of fear related to panic disorder (PD). Based on that finding, we evaluated if treatment with ketamine and another NMDA antagonist, MK-801, would induce acute and sustained (24 hours later) anxiolytic and/or panicolytic-like effects in animals exposed to the elevated T-maze (ETM). The ETM evaluates, in the same animal, conflict-evoked and fear behaviors, which are related, respectively, to generalized anxiety disorder and PD. Male Wistar rats were systemically treated with racemic ketamine (10, 30 and 80 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and tested in the ETM in the same day or 24 hours after their administration. Ketamine did not affect the behavioral tasks performed in the ETM acutely or 24 h later. MK-801 impaired inhibitory avoidance in the ETM only at 45 min post-injection, suggesting a rapid but not sustained anxiolytic-like effect. Altogether our results suggest that ketamine might have mixed effects in anxiety tests while it does not affect panic-related behaviors.HighlightsKetamine induces mixed effects in animal anxiety testsFew studies investigated the individual effects of S-ketamine in anxiety/fear testsNone study evaluated the effects of R-Ketamine on anxiety/fear-related behaviorsSystemic ketamine does not affect panic-like behaviors in the elevated T-maze",1178,3447,647,45.0

How do such cooperative bonds form between complete strangers? Here, we show evidence that unfamiliar nonkin vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) selectively escalate low-cost investments in allogrooming before developing higher-cost food-sharing relationships. By introducing female bats from geographically distant sites in captive pairs or groups and fasting them repeatedly over 15 months, we observed that increasing rates of grooming a partner predicted the occurrence of that partner’s first food donation back to the groomer, after which grooming rates no longer increased. New food-sharing relationships formed in 14.5% of 608 possible female pairs, emerged in a reciprocal pattern, and developed more often when strangers lacked alternative familiar partners. Our results are consistent with predictions from the ‘raising-the-stakes’ hypothesis that strangers ‘test the waters’ of new relationships by initially making low-cost investments in grooming before making higher-cost food donations. This form of ‘raising the stakes’ (e.g., transitions from clustering to grooming to food sharing) might play an underappreciated role in many other social decisions with long-term consequences, such as joining a new social group or choosing a long-term mate.Significance statement Vampire bats form long-term cooperative social bonds that involve reciprocal regurgitated blood sharing. But how do two individuals go from complete strangers to reciprocal food donors? By introducing unfamiliar bats, we found evidence that low-cost grooming paves the way for higher-cost food donations. Bats that formed new food-sharing relationships had a history of escalating reciprocal grooming up until the food sharing began. Food sharing emerged in a reciprocal fashion and it emerged more often when two strangers could not access their original groupmates. The finding that unfamiliar nonkin vampire bats appeared to gradually and selectively transition from low-cost to high-cost cooperative behaviors is the first evidence that nonhuman animals ‘raise the stakes’ when forming new cooperative relationships.",2462,419,816,10.0

Providing eggs with resources is energetically demanding, since in most species females lay one egg per day. However, the costs of egg laying not only relate to energetic requirements, but also depend on the availability of specific resources that are vital for egg production and embryonic development. One of these compounds are carotenoids, pigments with antioxidant properties and immuno-stimulatory functions, which are crucial during embryonic development. In this study, we explore how carotenoid availability alleviates this trade-off and facilitates egg laying in the blue tit. Blue tit females lay one egg per day and have the largest clutch size of all European passerines. We performed a lutein supplementation experiment, and measured potential consequences for egg laying capacity and egg quality. We found that lutein-supplemented females had less laying interruptions and thus completed their clutch faster than control females. No effects of treatment were found on the onset of egg laying or clutch size. Experimentally enhanced carotenoid availability did not elevate yolk carotenoid levels or egg mass, but negatively affected eggshell thickness. Our results provide hence evidence on the limiting role of carotenoids during egg laying, However, the benefits of laying faster following lutein supplementation were counterbalanced by a lower accumulation of calcium in the eggshell. Thus, even though single components may constrain egg laying, it is the combined availability of a range of different resources which ultimately determines egg quality and thus embryonic development.",1010,69,250,32.0

Kearns",788703;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/788703,"Rationale In a previous study investigating choice between heroin and a non-drug alternative in animals, reductions in income (i.e., choices/day) caused the percentage of income spent on heroin to progressively decrease. In contrast, another study found that humans with opioid use disorder spent the majority of their income on heroin even though they had little income. Comparison of these two studies suggests that the seemingly conflicting results could be explained by differences in the underlying economy types of the choice alternatives.Objective The present experiment tested the hypothesis that the effect of income changes on choice between heroin and a non-drug alternative depends on economy type.Methods Rats chose between heroin and saccharin under three income levels. For the Closed group, the choice session was the only opportunity to obtain these reinforcers. For the Heroin Open group and the Saccharin Open group, choice sessions were followed by 3-h periods of unlimited access to heroin or saccharin, respectively.Results As income decreased, the Closed and Heroin Open groups, but not the Saccharin Open group, spent an increasingly greater percentage of income on saccharin than on heroin. The Saccharin Open group, compared to the other groups, spent a greater percentage of income on heroin as income decreased.Conclusions Results confirm that the effects of income and economy type can interact and this may explain the apparently discrepant results of earlier studies. More generally, findings suggest that situations where heroin choice has little consequence for consumption of non-drug alternatives may promote heroin use.",598,117,223,24.0

Variation in several personality dimensions is associated with distinct fitness consequences and thus, may become a target of natural and/or sexual selection. However, the link between animal personality and mate choice—as a major component of sexual selection—remains understudied. We asked (1) whether females and males of the livebearing fish Poecilia mexicana prefer risk-taking mating partners (directional mating preference), (2) or if their preferences are dependent on the choosing individual’s own personality type (assortative mating). We characterized each test subject for its risk-taking behaviour, assessed as the time to emerge from shelter and enter an unknown area. In dichotomous association preference tests, we offered two potential mating partners that differed in risk-taking behaviour but were matched for other phenotypic traits (body size, shape, and colouration). Females, but not males, exhibited a strong directional preference for risk-taking over risk-averse mating partners. At the same time, the strength of females’ preferences correlated positively with their own risk-taking scores. Our study is the first to demonstrate that a strong overall preference for risk-taking mating partners does not preclude effects of choosing individuals’ own personality type on (subtle) individual variation in mating preferences.

In insect colonies, genetic, behavioral and morphological variation among workers can improve colony functioning and resilience. However, it has been hypothesized that during communication processes, differences between workers, e.g. in body size, could also have negative effects. Tandem running is a common recruitment strategy in ants and allows a leader to guide a nestmate follower to resources. A substantial proportion of tandem runs fail because leader and follower loose contact. Using the ant Temnothorax nylanderi as a model system, we tested the hypothesis that tandem running success is impaired if leader and follower differ in size. Indeed, we found that the success rate of tandem pairs drops considerably as size variation increases: only ~7% of tandem runs were successful when the leader-follower size difference exceeded 10%, whereas 80% of tandem runs were successful when ants differed less than 5% in body length. One possible explanation is that ant size is linked to the preferred walking speed. Ants did not choose partners of similar size, but extranidal workers were larger than intranidal workers, which could reduce recruitment mistakes because it reduced the chance that very large and very small ants perform tandem runs together. Our results suggest that phenotypic differences between interacting workers can have negative effects on the efficiency of communication processes. Whether phenotypic variation has positive or negative effects is likely to depend on the task and the phenotypic trait that shows variation.",668,108,228,22.0

Volatiles released by human facial skin microbiota play different roles in the host-seeking behavior of triatomines. We assessed the repellency effect of such compounds of bacterial origin on Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, two important vectors of Chagas disease in Latin America.Methods Using an exposure device, insects were presented to human odor alone (negative control) and in the presence of three individual tested compounds (2-mercaptoethanol, dimethyl sulfide and 2-phenylethanol, which was only tested in R. prolixus) and the gold-standard repellent NN-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide–DEET (positive control). We quantified the time the insects spent in the proximity of the host and performed nonparametric statistical tests to determine if any of the compounds evaluated affected the behavior of the insect.Results We found volatiles that significantly reduced the time spent in the proximity of the host. These were 2-phenylethanol and 2-mercaptoethanol for R. prolixus, and dimethyl sulfide and 2-mercaptoethanol for T. infestans. Such an effect was also observed in both species when DEET was presented, although only at the higher doses tested.Conclusions The new repellents modulated the behavior of two Chagas disease vectors belonging to two different triatomine tribes, and this was achieved using a dose up to three orders of magnitude lower than that needed to evoke the same effect with DEET. Future efforts in understanding deeply the mechanism of action of repellent compounds such as 2-mercaptoethanol, as well as an assessment of their temporal and spatial repellent properties, could lead to the development of novel control strategies for insect vectors refractory to DEET.",620,213,236,22.0

Hauber",788505;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/788505,"The rejection of parasitic eggs by hosts of avian brood parasites is one of the most common and effective defenses against parasitism. Despite its adaptive significance, egg rejection often shows substantial intraspecific variation: some individuals are more likely to remove or abandon parasitic eggs than others. Understanding variation in egg rejection requires that we study factors linked to both the ability to perceive parasitic eggs, as well as factors that may influence the rejection of a foreign egg once it has been recognized. Here we asked what cognitive, physiological, and life-history factors explained variation in the rejection of model eggs by American Robin Turdus migratorius females. We found that the probability of egg rejection was related to the clutch size at the time of parasitism: in support of Weber’s law, females with fewer eggs were more likely to reject the model eggs. In turn, females with greater mass and higher corticosterone levels were less likely to reject eggs, and egg rejection probability was negatively related to incubation progress. Our data thus suggest that proximate predictors of an individual’s egg rejection behavior include components of the nest’s perceptual environment, life-history factors, as well as the physiological state of the animal. However, much of the variation in the responses of robins to the model eggs remained unexplained. Future experiments should aim to understand the causal roles of these and other factors in generating within- and among-individual variation in the rejection of parasitic eggs.",588,118,310,36.0

We tested this hypothesis with a comparative study across five wild populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) known to differ in their ecology and social behaviour. Using a field experiment, we found population differences in how guppies used and learned from social information, with only fish from one of the three rivers studied showing evidence of social information use and social learning. Within this river, populations differed in how they employed social information: fish from a high-predation regime where guppies exhibit high shoaling propensities chose the same foraging location than conspecifics, while fish from a low-predation regime with reduced shoaling propensities chose and learned the opposite foraging location than conspecifics. We speculate that these differences are due to differences in predation risk and conspecific competition, possibly mediated via changes in grouping tendencies.

There is growing evidence, from a range of taxa, that information about the locations of food patches can spread through a population via social connections. However, it is not known whether information about the quality of potential food sources transmits similarly. We studied foraging behaviour in a population of wild songbirds with known social associations, and tested whether flock members use social information about the profitability of patches to inform their foraging decisions. We provided artificial patches (ephemeral bird feeders) that appeared identical but were either profitable (contained food) or unprofitable (contained no food). If information about patch profitability spreads via social associations, we predicted that empty feeders would only be sampled by individuals that are less connected to each other than expected by chance. In contrast, we found that individuals recorded at empty feeders were more closely associated with each other than predicted by a null model simulating random arrival of individuals, mirroring pattern of increased connectedness among individuals recorded at full feeders. We then simulated arrival under network-based diffusion of information, and demonstrate that the observed pattern at both full and empty feeders matches predictions derived from this post-hoc model. Our results suggest that foraging songbirds only use social cues about the location of potential food sources, but not their profitability. These findings agree with the hypothesis that individuals balance the relative economic costs of using different information, where the costs of personally sampling a patch upon arrival is low relative to the cost of searching for patches.

Using a recently developed tracking system based on Bluetooth® Low Energy beacons, we collected three-dimensional (3D) location data from five Japanese macaques living in a group cage. A non-parametric, neural network-based analysis of the data revealed the existence of personality traits in extremely limited aspects of the movement data (2-min trajectory of 3D location).

When an item is retrieved, activation spreads across nodes depending on edge weights and the strength of initial activation. A non-monotonic plasticity rule, in turn, updates edge weights following activation. SAMPL simulates human memory phenomena across a number of experiments including retrieval induced forgetting, context-based memory enhancement, and memory synchronization in conversational networks.

In a field study of three consecutive cohorts of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) we determined the older bird (primary tutor) from whom the young bird (tutee) learned most of his songs, and how long tutee and primary tutor survived subsequently.

However, there is a paucity of information on gait phenotypes in the NDD experimental models. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the normal developmental trajectory of gait maturation in the mouse. Using the DigiGait system, we have developed a quantitative, standardized, and reproducible assay of developmental gait metrics in commonly used mouse strains that can be added to the battery of mouse model phenotyping. With this assay, we characterized the trajectory of gait in the developing C57BL/6J and FVB/AntJ mouse lines. In both lines, maturation of mouse gait between P21 and P30 was best reflected by aspects of the stance phase of the stride. Additionally, in C57BL/6J mice, gait maturation was observed through how the paw is loaded and unloaded during the stance phase of a stride. In FVB/AntJ mice, gait maturity during this developmental window was best observed through the decreased variability in paw area on the belt during stance. Our results also underscore the importance of considering body length when interpreting gait metrics. Further, our results show that background strain needs to be considered when comparing gait across models. Overall, our results show that aspects of mouse gait development parallel a timeline of normal human gait development, such as the percent of stride that is stance phase and swing phase. This study may be used as a standard reference for developmental gait phenotyping of a variety of murine models, such as models of neurodevelopmental disease.",856,948,443,49.0

Given that JH commonly affects adult insect fertility, it has been hypothesized to also regulate behaviors such as dominance and aggression that are associated with reproduction. We tested this hypothesis in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris for which JH has been shown to be the major gonadotropin. We used the allatoxin Precocene-I (P-I) to reduce hemolymph JH titers and replacement therapy with the natural JH to revert this effect. In small orphan groups of workers with similar body size but mixed treatment, P-I treated bees showed lower aggressiveness, oogenesis, and dominance rank compared with control and replacement therapy treated bees. In similar groups in which all bees were treated similarly, there was a clear dominance hierarchy, even in P-I and replacement therapy treatment groups in which the bees showed similar levels of ovarian activation. In a similar experiment in which bees differed in body size, larger bees were more likely to be dominant despite their similar JH treatment and ovarian state. In the last experiment, we show that JH manipulation does not affect dominance rank in groups that had already established a stable dominance hierarchy. These findings solve previous ambiguities concerning whether or not JH affects dominance in bumble bees. JH positively affects dominance, but bees with similar levels of JH can nevertheless establish dominance hierarchies. Thus, multiple factors including JH, body size, and previous experience affect dominance and aggression in social bumble bees.",1275,420,480,54.0

While flying bees can visit flowers in an optimised sequence over kilometres, walking ants can precisely recapitulate routes of up to a hundred metres in complex environments. It is clear that route following depends largely on learnt visual information and we have good idea how views can guide individuals along them, however little is known about the mechanisms that control route learning and development. Here we show that ants in natural environments can actively learn a route detour to avoid a pit trap and that this depends on a process analogous to aversive trace conditioning. Views experienced before falling into the trap become associated with the ensuing negative outcome and thus trigger salutary turns on the subsequent trip. This drives the ants to orient away from the goal direction and avoid the trap. If the pit is avoided, the novel views experienced during the detour become positively reinforced and the new route crystallises. We discuss how such an interplay between appetitive and aversive memories might be implemented in insect neural circuitry.",894,254,371,25.0

Here, we investigated changes in spinal excitability during action observation by monitoring short latency electromyographic responses produced by single shocks delivered directly to the pyramidal tract. Responses in hand and digit muscles were recorded from two adult rhesus macaques while they performed, observed or withheld reach-to-grasp and hold actions. We found modest grasp-specific facilitation of hand muscle responses during hand shaping for grasp, which persisted when the grasp was predictable but obscured from the monkey’s vision. We also found evidence of a more general inhibition before observed movement onset, and the size of this inhibition effect was comparable to the inhibition after an explicit NoGo signal. These results confirm that the spinal circuitry controlling hand muscles is modulated during action observation, and this may be driven by internal representations of actions. The relatively modest changes in spinal excitability during observation suggest net corticospinal outflow exerts only minor, sub-threshold changes on hand motoneuron pools, thereby preventing any overflow of mirror activity into overt movement.",1004,168,271,43.0

How does this process of social learning impact the individual and the group’s performance? On the one hand, research has shown that individuals benefit from social learning in numerous situations and across many domains. Through social learning, individuals can access good solutions found by others, improve them, and share them in turn. On the other hand, this individual benefit may come at a cost: An excessive tendency to copy others often decreases the overall exploration volume of the group, thus reducing the diversity of discovered solutions, and eventually impairing the collective performance.Here we investigate the conditions under which social learning can be beneficial or detrimental to individuals and to the group. For that, we model problem-solving as a search task and simulate various amounts of social learning. We avoid model specific considerations by relying on a simple framework whereby individuals gradually explore the search environment – a two-dimensional landscape of solutions – while being attracted to the best solution of the group.Our results highlight a collective search dilemma: When group members learn from one another, they tend to improve their own individual performance at the expense of the collective performance. How is this dilemma affected by the structure of the search environment? By varying two structural aspects of the search environment, our results reveal that the negative effect of the dilemma is mitigated in more difficult environments.Finally, we show that single individuals can profit from a high propensity of social learning, which in turn is damaging for the other group members. As a consequence, if individuals continually adapt their behavior to maximize their own payoff, groups converge to a sub-optimal level of social learning. Unraveling these intricate social dynamics helps to understand the complex picture of collective problem-solving.",667,115,260,16.0

This collective achievement crucially depends on how the group is structured, that is, how information flows between members and how individual contributions are merged. Numerous methods have been proposed, which can be divided into two major categories: those that involve an exchange of information between the group members, and those that do not. Here we compare two instances of such methods for solving complex problems: (1) transmission chains, where individuals tackle the problem one after the other, each one building on the solution of the predecessor and (2) groups of independent solvers, where individuals tackle the problem independently, and the best solution found in the group is selected afterwards.By means of numerical simulations and experimental observations, we show that the best performing method is determined by the interplay between two key factors: the skills of the individuals and the difficulty of the problem. We find that transmission chains are superior either when the problem is rather easy, or when the group is composed of rather unskilled individuals. On the contrary, groups of independent solvers are preferable for harder problems or for groups of rather skillful individuals. Finally, we deepen the comparison by studying the impact of the group size and diversity. Our research stresses that efficient collective problem-solving requires a good matching between the nature of the problem and the structure of the group.",679,214,247,22.0

In particular, the fitting of demand curves to consumption data provides a powerful analytic tool for computing objective metrics of behavior that can be compared across a wide range of reward types and experimental settings. The results of these analyses depend crucially on the mathematical form used to fit the data. The most common choice is an exponential form proposed by Hursh and Silberberg, which is widely used and has provided fundamental insights into relationships between cost and consumption, but it also has some disadvantages. In this paper we first briefly review the use of demand curves to quantify the motivating effects of food and drugs, then we describe the current methodology and highlight some potential issues that arise in its application. To address these issues, we propose a new mathematical framework for the analysis of consumption data, including a new functional form for the demand curve. We show that this proposed form gives good fits to data on a range of reinforcers across different animals and different experimental protocols, while allowing for straightforward calculation of key metrics of demand, including preferred consumption level, maximum response, price at maximum response, and price elasticity of demand.

Following short-term, repeated treatment with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at two different doses (1.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg), Sub mice presented significant place-aversion in a Conditioned Place Preference paradigm at a high dose, whereas Dom mice displayed no place preference or aversion. Forced Swim test conducted after 6-week of washout period, revealed differential impact of the two THC doses depending upon behavioral pattern. Specifically, the low dose alleviated depressive-like behavior in Sub mice, while the high dose produced the opposite effect in Dom mice. Interestingly, corticosterone concentration in serum was elevated at the high dose regardless of the mice-population tested. We conclude here that differences in dominance behavior and stress vulnerability are involved in the regulation of cannabis response among users and should be considered when prescribing THC-containing medications to patients.",1403,489,437,20.0

Physiologists often relate growth rates to hormonal control of essential processes. Ecologists often study growth as function of gradients or combinations of environmental factors. Fewer studies have investigated the combined effects of environmental and hormonal control on growth. Here, we present an evolutionary optimization model of fish growth that combines internal regulation of growth by hormone levels with the external influence of food availability and predation risk. Hormones are represented by growth hormone, thyroid hormone and orexin functions. By studying a range from poor to rich environments, we find that the level of food availability in the environment results in different evolutionarily optimal strategies of hormone levels. With more food available, higher levels of hormones are optimal, resulting in higher food uptake and growth. By using this fitness-based approach we also find a consequence of evolutionary optimization of survival on optimal hormone use. Where foraging is risky, aerobic scope can be used strategically to increase the chance of escaping from predators. By comparing model results to empirical observations, many mechanisms can be recognized, for instance a change in pace-of-life due to resource availability, and reduced emphasis on reserves in more stable environments.Summary statement We combine physiological, environmental and evolutionary aspects of fish growth in a state-dependent model where the optimal regulation of growth and survival is achieved through hormonal regulation of behaviour.",798,125,260,41.0

Fitzpatrick, Jonathan D. Morrow",767095;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/767095,"When a neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with an appetitive reward, two different types of conditioned approach responses may develop: a sign-tracking response directed toward the neutral cue, or a goal-tracking response directed toward the location of impending reward delivery. Sign-tracking responses have been postulated to result from attribution of incentive value to conditioned cues, while goal-tracking reflects the assignment of only predictive value to the cue. We therefore hypothesized that sign-tracking would be more sensitive to manipulations of incentive value, while goal-tracking would be more responsive to changes in the predictive value of the cue. We tested sign- and goal-tracking before and after devaluation of a food reward using lithium chloride, and tested whether either response could be learned under negative contingency conditions that precluded any serendipitous reinforcement of the behavior that might support instrumental learning. We also tested the effects on sign- and goal-tracking of blocking the predictive value of a cue using simultaneous presentation of a pre-conditioned cue. We found that sign-tracking was sensitive to outcome devaluation, while goal-tracking was not. We also confirmed that both responses are Pavlovian because they can be learned under negative contingency conditions. Goal-tracking was completely blocked by a pre-conditioned cue, while sign-tracking was only partially reduced. These results indicate that sign- and goal-tracking follow different rules of reinforcement learning and suggest a need to revise current models of associative learning to account for these differences.",907,99,221,24.0

Despite their potential role in the lives of both the organisms that express them and other organisms that can be influenced by extended phenotypes, the consistency and covariance with morphological and behaviour traits of extended phenotypes is rarely evaluated, especially in wild organisms. We repeatedly measured an extended phenotype that directly influences an organism’s prey acquisition, the web structure, of wild orb-weaving spiders (Micrathena vigorsii), which re-build their webs each day. We related web structure traits to behavioural traits and body size (length). Both web diameter and web density were repeatably different among individuals, while reaction to a predation threat was slightly so, but response to a prey stimulus and web symmetry were not. There was a syndrome between morphology and web structure traits, where larger spiders spun webs that were wider, had webs with increased thread spacing, and the spider tended to react more slowly to a predation threat. When a spider built a relatively larger web it was also relatively a less dense and less symmetrical web. The repeatability of web construction and relationship with spider body size we found may be common features of intra-population variation in web structure in spiders. Individual variation along the morphology and web structure syndrome could represent variation in individual foraging strategies, or age-based correlated changes. By estimating the consistency and covariances of extended phenotypes we can begin to evaluate what maintains their variation and how they might evolve.",892,447,341,29.0

This type of environment has been relatively overlooked in the past despite being relevant to numerous real-life situations, such as spatial search and various problem-solving tasks.By means of a dedicated experimental design, we show that the search behaviour of experimental participants can be well described by a simple heuristic model.

Buckley",764969;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/764969,"Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, action-oriented models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a bad-bootstrap. Here, we exploit the normative framework of active inference to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (information-seeking) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.",2332,190,1023,34.0

In addition, it also looks into the issue of whether the gender retrieval mechanism in the language influences agreement comprehension. Results revealed a positivity for the animate subject agreement and a negativity for the inanimate subject agreement violations at the position of the verb respectively.

Scientists are becoming increasingly reliant on citizen scientists to help fill in gaps where they exist, especially in the area of biodiversity. Here, uniquely, we use social media and citizen science videos to investigate the behavioural ecology of hunting in five cuttlefish species – Metasepia pfefferi (N = 24), Sepia apama (N = 13), Sepia latimanus (N = 8), Sepia officinalis (N = 17), and Sepia pharaonis (N = 23). We find that hunting strategies and prey type differ between species as do the types of behaviours used by the five species studied here. We also use kinematic permutation analysis to elucidate chains of behaviours, finding that cuttlefish significantly use a mixture of predator behaviours but also prey-like behaviours, such as warning signals and possibly even a ‘pursuit-deterrent signal’ during the final moments of hunting. We also show and discuss significant intraspecific differences.",830,439,370,27.0

In the urban environment, humans are a part of an interaction network of several species. While indirect human influence on different urban species has been measured extensively, experimental studies concerning direct human influence are lacking. In this study, we tested interactions between groups of urban free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and solitary unfamiliar humans in ecologically relevant contexts. We provided different sets of dogs with four commonly used human social cues (neutral, friendly, low and high impact threatening) to understand their responses at the group-level and identify potential inter-individual differences. Finally, we compared data from a previous study to investigate the differences in behavioural outcomes between solitary and groups of dogs while interacting with humans. The study not only strengthens the idea of situation-relevant responsiveness in free-ranging dogs but also highlights the minute differences between solitary and group-level reactions in the form of higher approach and less anxious behaviour of groups towards the unfamiliar human. Additionally, we report inter-individual differences and the effect of sex while responding to the threatening cues.

We investigated whether, in cooperatively breeding carrion crows (Corvus corone), the quality of social relationships correlates with coccidian oocyst and nematode eggs excretion. We repeatably collected behavioural data on dyadic social interactions and individual droppings to quantify parasite eggs and oocysts from 36 individuals in a captive population of carrion crows in northern Spain. Individuals with strong social bonds, living with more relatives and in larger groups excreted a significantly smaller proportion of droppings containing coccidian oocysts. The probability to excrete droppings containing nematode eggs was not affected by social factors. The relationship between social interactions and coccidian oocyst excretion is consistent with the idea that high quality social relationships can positively affects individual’s health, setting the stage for the evolution of stable social living.",1667,491,651,42.0

Hudson, Nicole Creanza, Daizaburo Shizuka",756445;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/756445,"Oscine songbirds are an ideal system for investigating how early experience affects behavior. Young songbirds face a challenging task: how to recognize and selectively learn only their own species’ song, often during a time-limited window. Because birds are capable of hearing birdsong very early in life, early exposure to song could plausibly affect recognition of appropriate models; however, this idea conflicts with the traditional view that song learning occurs only after a bird leaves the nest. Thus, it remains unknown whether natural variation in acoustic exposure prior to song learning affects the template for recognition. In a population where sister species, golden-crowned and white-crowned sparrows, breed syntopically, we found that nestlings discriminate between heterospecific and conspecific song playbacks prior to the onset of song memorization. We then asked whether natural exposure to more frequent or louder heterospecific song explained any variation in golden-crowned nestling response to heterospecific song playbacks. We characterized the amount of each species’ song audible in golden-crowned sparrow nests and showed that even in a relatively small area, the ratio of heterospecific to conspecific song exposure varies widely. However, although many songbirds hear and respond to acoustic signals before fledging, golden-crowned sparrow nestlings that heard different amounts of heterospecific song did not behave differently in response to heterospecific playbacks. This study provides the first evidence that song discrimination at the onset of song learning is robust to the presence of closely related heterospecifics in nature, which may be an important adaptation in sympatry between potentially interbreeding taxa.",884,155,332,32.0

Males produce calls with a higher peak frequency, exhibit shorter note lengths and emit a greater number of notes within a calling bout than females, which could relate to mate attraction.

Brown",759928;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/759928,"For most animals, feeding includes two behaviours: foraging to find a food patch and food intake once a patch is found. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model for studying the genetics of both behaviours. However, most methods of measuring feeding in worms quantify either foraging behaviour or food intake but not both. Imaging the depletion of fluorescently labelled bacteria provides information on both the distribution and amount of consumption, but even after patch exhaustion a prominent background signal remains, which complicates quantification. Here, we used a bioluminescent Escherichia coli strain to quantify C. elegans feeding. With light emission tightly coupled to active metabolism, only living bacteria are capable of bioluminescence so the signal is lost upon ingestion. We quantified the loss of bioluminescence using N2 reference worms and eat-2 mutants, and found a nearly 100-fold increase in signal-to-background ratio and lower background compared to loss of fluorescence. We also quantified feeding using aggregating npr-1 mutant worms. We found that groups of npr-1 mutants first clear bacteria from each other before foraging collectively for more food; similarly, during high density swarming, only worms at the migrating front are in contact with bacteria. These results demonstrate the usefulness of bioluminescent bacteria for quantifying feeding and suggest a hygiene hypothesis for the function of C. elegans aggregation and swarming.",1284,154,932,18.0

They allow for control of features such as gaze, expression and movement, which may help to overcome limitations of using either static or poorly controlled real stimuli. In using virtual stimuli however, one must be careful to avoid the uncanny valley effect - where realistic stimuli can be perceived as eerie, and induce an aversion response. At the same time, it is important to establish whether responses to virtual stimuli mirror responses to depictions of a real conspecific. In the current study, we describe the development of a new avatar with realistic features for nonhuman primates, the ‘primatar’. As a first step towards validation, we assessed how monkeys respond to images of this avatar compared to images of real monkeys, and an unrealistic avatar. We also compared responses between original images and scrambled as well as obfuscated versions of these images. We measured looking time to images in six free moving long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and eye movement exploration behaviour in three rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Both groups showed more of such signs of overt attention to original images than scrambled or obfuscated images. In addition, we assessed whether the realistic avatar created an uncanny valley effect through decreased looking time, finding that in both groups, monkeys did not differentiate between real, realistic or unrealistic images. These results provide support for further development of our avatar for use in social cognition studies, and more generally for cognitive research with virtual stimuli in nonhuman primates. Future research needs to shed light on the source of the inconsistent findings for the uncanny valley effect in macaques, to elucidate the roots of this mechanism in humans.",1425,251,445,25.0

Moore, Shannon M. Danforth, Joanna G. Larson, Alison R. Davis Rabosky",754994;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/754994,"Warning signals in chemically defended organisms are critical components of predator-prey interactions, often requiring multiple coordinated display components for a signal to be effective. When threatened by a predator, venomous coral snakes (genus Micrurus) display a vigorous, non-locomotory thrashing behaviour that has been only qualitatively described. Given the high-contrast and often colourful banding patterns of these snakes, this thrashing display is hypothesized to be a key component of a complex aposematic signal under strong stabilizing selection across species in a mimicry system.By experimentally testing snake response across simulated predator cues, we analysed variation in the presence and expression of a thrashing display across five species of South American coral snakes.Although the major features of the thrash display were conserved across species, we found significant variation in the propensity to perform a display at all, the duration of thrashing, and the curvature of snake bodies that was mediated by predator cue type, snake body size, and species identity. We also found an interaction between curve magnitude and body location that clearly shows which parts of the display vary most across individuals and species.Our results suggest that contrary to the assumption in the literature that all species and individuals perform the same display, a high degree of variation persists in thrashing behaviour exhibited by Micrurus coral snakes despite presumably strong selection to converge on a common signal. This quantitative behavioural characterization presents a new framework for analysing the non-locomotory motions displayed by snakes in a broader ecological context, especially for signalling systems with complex interaction across multiple modalities.",725,140,338,29.0

These conditioned stimuli (CS) can then guide reward-seeking behaviour in adaptive (e.g., locating food) and maladaptive (e.g., binge eating) ways. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) contributes to learning of the predictive value of CS, but less is known about BLA contributions to the incentive motivational properties of appetitive CS. Here we studied the influence of BLA neuron activity on both the predictive and incentive motivational effects of CS. Water-restricted male rats learned to associate a light-tone cue (CS) with water delivery into a port. We assessed the predictive value to the CS by measuring CS-evoked port entries during Pavlovian conditioning. We assessed CS-evoked incentive motivation by measuring lever-pressing for the CS during instrumental responding sessions. During Pavlovian conditioning, we paired CS presentations with photo-stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing BLA neurons. This potentiated CS-evoked port entries during conditioning, but suppressed subsequent lever-pressing for the CS. This indicates increased conditioned responding to the CS, but an apparent decrease in incentive motivation for that CS. However, in rats previously naïve to photo-stimulation, pairing BLA-ChR2 stimulations during lever-pressing for the CS intensified responding, indicating enhanced motivation for the CS. Rats did not self-administer BLA-ChR2 stimulations, suggesting that BLA activation does not carry a primary reward signal. Lastly, intra-BLA infusions of d-amphetamine also intensified lever-pressing for the CS. These converging findings suggest that BLA mediated-activity enhances both the predictive and incentive motivational properties of CS, allowing BLA-dependent circuits to guide behaviour in the presence of reward-associated cues.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cues paired with rewards can guide animals to valuable resources such as food. Cues can also promote dysfunctional reward-seeking behaviour, as in over-eating. Reward-paired cues influence reward seeking through two major mechanisms. First, reward-paired cues are predictive and thus evoke anticipation of future rewards. Second, reward-paired cues are powerful motivators and they can evoke pursuit in their own right. Here we show that increasing neural activity in the basolateral amygdala enhances both the predictive and motivational effects of reward-paired cues. The basolateral amygdala therefore facilitates cue-induced control over behaviour by both increasing anticipation for impending rewards and making reward cues more attractive.",858,115,296,41.0

Larval zebrafish intercept paramecia during their hunting behavior, but the precise trajectories of their prey have never been recorded in relation to fish movements in three dimensions.As a means of uncovering what a simple organism understands about its physical world, we have constructed a 3D-imaging setup to simultaneously record the behavior of larval zebrafish, as well as their moving prey, during hunting. We show that zebrafish robustly transform their 3D displacement and rotation according to the position of their prey while modulating both of these variables depending on prey velocity. This is true for both azimuth and altitude, but particulars of the hunting algorithm in the two planes are slightly different to accommodate an asymmetric strike zone. We show that the combination of position and velocity perception provides the fish with a preferred future positional estimate, indicating an ability to project trajectories forward in time. Using computational models, we show that this projection ability is critical for prey capture efficiency and success. Further, we demonstrate that fish use a graded stochasticity algorithm where the variance around the mean result of each swim scales with distance from the target. Notably, this strategy provides the animal with a considerable improvement over equivalent noise-free strategies.In sum, our quantitative and probabilistic modeling shows that zebrafish are equipped with a stochastic recursive algorithm that embodies an implicit predictive model of the world. This algorithm, built by a simple set of behavioral rules, allows the fish to optimize their hunting strategy in a naturalistic three-dimensional environment.",1841,136,595,28.0

First, honey bee drone and worker antennae differ in the number of olfactory receptor genes (ORs) showing a biased expression pattern. Only 19 Ors were higher expressed in drone antennae, whereas 54 Ors were higher expressed in workers. Second, drone antennae showed predominant higher expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, and worker antennae showed a higher expression of genes involved in neuronal communication. Third, drones and afternoon-trained foragers showed similar daily changes in the expression of major clock genes, per and cry2. Most of the other genes showing changes with the onset of daily activity were specific to drones and foragers suggesting sex-specific circadian changes in antennae.

Sewall",753772;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/753772,"Competitive interactions among conspecifics are often resolved by assessing signals that honestly indicate individual fighting ability or dominance. In territorial species, signals of competitive ability are thought to function primarily during the early stages of territory establishment, but recent evidence suggests that these signals continue to influence interactions with floaters and neighbors well after territory establishment. Here, we examine the influence of the extent of chest spotting displayed by an intruding male on the response of territorial male song sparrows. We exposed males to 3-D printed models with large or small spotting area coupled with conspecific playback and recorded their behavior. We also assessed the response of a subset of males to both the 3-D printed models and a traditional, taxidermic mount to ensure the 3-D models were a realistic stimulus. We found no differences in the number of attacks or proximity to the model due to spotting area. However, territorial males produced more soft songs and tended to sing fewer loud songs, both of which predict attack in our population, in response to the model with less chest spotting. One possibility is that males with less chest spotting elicit a stronger response because they are seen as a greater threat. Based on our previous findings in this system, we think it is more likely that models with less chest spotting are perceived as subordinate and therefore easier to defeat, leading to a stronger response by territory holders. We found males were equally likely to attack 3-D printed models and a taxidermic mount but signaled more aggressively during trials with the taxidermic mount than the 3-D printed models. This suggests that birds recognized the 3-D models as meaningful stimuli but that the use of 3-D printed models should be validated through comparison to a traditional taxidermic mount when possible.",713,216,258,25.0

Hillman",752410;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/752410,"Here we present a novel effort-based task for laboratory rats: the weight lifting task (WLT). Studies of effort expenditure in rodents have typically involved climbing barriers within T-mazes or operant lever pressing paradigms. These task designs have been successful for neuropharmacological and neurophysiological investigations, but both tasks involve simple action patterns prone to automatization. Furthermore, high climbing barriers present risk of injury to animals and/or tethered recording equipment. In the WLT, a rat is placed in a large rectangular arena and tasked with pulling a rope 30 cm to trigger food delivery at a nearby spout; weights can be added to the rope in 45 g increments to increase the intensity of effort. As compared to lever pressing and barrier jumping, 30 cm of rope pulling is a multi-step action sequence requiring sustained effort. The actions are carried out on the single plane of the arena floor, making it safer for the animal and more suitable for tethered equipment and video tracking. A microcontroller and associated sensors enable precise timestamping of specific behaviors to synchronize with electrophysiological recordings. The rope and reward spout are spatially segregated to allow for spatial discrimination of the effort zone and the reward zone. We validated the task across five cohorts of rats (total n=35) and report consistent behavioral metrics. The WLT is well-suited for neuropharmacological and/or in vivo neurophysiological investigations surrounding effortful behaviors, particularly when wanting to probe different aspects of effort expenditure (intensity vs. duration).",6405,294,530,21.0

Collins",753244;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/753244,"In response to noxious stimuli, planarians cease their typical ciliary gliding and exhibit an oscillatory type of locomotion called scrunching. We have previously characterized the biomechanics of scrunching and shown that it is induced by specific stimuli, such as amputation, noxious heat, and extreme pH. Because these specific inducers are known to activate Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels in other systems, we hypothesized that TRP channels control scrunching. We found that chemicals known to activate TRPA1 (allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and hydrogen peroxide) and TRPV (capsaicin and anandamide) in other systems induce scrunching in the planarian species Dugesia japonica and, except for anandamide, in Schmidtea mediterranea. To confirm that these responses were specific to either TRPA1 or TRPV, respectively, we tried to block scrunching using selective TRPA1 or TRPV antagonists and RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown. Unexpectedly, co-treatment with a mammalian TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031, enhanced AITC-induced scrunching by decreasing the latency time, suggesting an agonistic relationship in planarians. We further confirmed that TRPA1 in both species is necessary for AITC-induced scrunching using RNAi. Conversely, while co-treatment of a mammalian TRPV antagonist, SB-366791, also enhanced capsaicin-induced reactions in D. japonica, combined knockdown of two previously identified D. japonica TRPV genes (DjTRPVa and DjTRPVb) did not inhibit capsaicin-induced scrunching. Surprisingly, RNAi of either DjTRPAa or DjTRPVa/DjTRPVb disrupted scrunching induced by the endocannabinoid and TRPV agonist, anandamide. Overall, our results show that although scrunching induction can involve different initial pathways for sensing stimuli, this behavior’s signature dynamical features are independent of the inducer, implying that scrunching is a stereotypical planarian escape behavior in response to various noxious stimuli that converge on a single downstream pathway. Understanding which aspects of nociception are conserved or not across different organisms can provide insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms to better understand pain sensation.",850,172,209,41.0

Acoustic signal space may be multidimensional, with coexisting species also vocalizing from different regions of physical space. Here, we demonstrate acoustic signal space partitioning in four sympatric species of wren-warbler (Cisticolidae, Prinia), in an Indian dry deciduous scrub habitat. We find that the breeding songs of wren-warblers are divergent from each other in multivariate parameter space, with only minimal interspecific overlap. Partitioning of signal space exerts constraints on the intraspecific diversity of acoustic signals, and each species exhibits different strategies to overcome these constraints. Two species partition intraspecific signal space into multiple note types, whereas a third exhibits intraspecific variation in repetition rate, thus supporting song diversity within a constrained acoustic space. Finally, we find that the four species also partition song perch heights, thus exhibiting separation along multiple axes of acoustic signal space. We hypothesize that divergent song perch heights may be driven by competition for higher singing perches or other ecological factors rather than signal propagation. Acoustic signal partitioning along multiple axes may therefore, we propose, arise from a combination of diverse ecological processes.",903,315,330,22.0

Consequently, how multimodal communication is affected by anthropogenic noise is relatively poorly understood. Here we ask whether song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) show evidence of plasticity in response to noise in two aggressive signals in acoustic and visual modalities. We test two hypotheses: (1) that song sparrows will shift signaling effort to the visual modality (the multi-modal shift hypothesis), and (2) that they will increase redundancy of their multi-modal signaling (the back-up hypothesis). We presented male song sparrows with song playback and a taxidermic mount with or without a low-frequency acoustic noise from a nearby speaker. We found that males did not switch their signaling effort to visual modality (i.e., wing waves) in response to the noise. However, the correlation between warbled soft songs and wing waves increased in the noise treatment, i.e. signals became more redundant. These results suggest that when faced with anthropogenic noise, song sparrows can increase redundancy of their multi-modal signals, which may aid in robustness of the communication system.",679,170,361,15.0

Currently, structures of complex movements are typically represented as a single-layer (or monoplex) network. However, aggregating individual movements, to generate population-level inferences, considerably reduces information on how individual or species variability influences spatial connectivity and thus identifying the mechanisms driving network structure remains difficult.Here, we propose incorporating the recent conceptual advances in multilayer network analyses with the existing movement network approach to improve our understanding of the complex interaction between spatial and/or social drivers of animal movement patterns.Specifically, we explore the application and interpretation of this framework using an empirical example of shark movement data gathered using passive remote sensors in a coral reef ecosystem. We first show how aggregating individual movement networks can lead to the loss of information, potentially misleading our interpretation of movement patterns. We then apply multilayer network analyses linking individual movement networks (i.e. layers) to the probabilities of social contact between individuals (i.e. interlayer edges) in order to explore the functional significance of different locations to an animal’s ecology.This approach provides a novel and holistic framework incorporating individual variability in behaviour and inter-individual interactions. We discuss how this approach can be used in applied ecology and conservation to better assess the ecological significance of variable space use by mobile animals within a population. Further, we argue that the uptake of multilayer networks will significantly broaden our understanding of long-term ecological and evolutionary processes, particularly in the context of information or disease transfer between individuals.",1480,203,812,26.0

The remarkable socio-cognitive skills of pet dogs, while interacting with humans, is quite well established. However, studies regarding the free-ranging subpopulations are greatly lacking. Free-ranging dogs represent an ideal system to investigate interspecific communication with unfamiliar humans, nullifying any contribution of indirect conditioning. The interactions of these dogs with humans are quite complex and multidimensional. For the first time, we tested free-ranging dogs’ ability to understand relatively complex human referential gestures using dynamic and momentary distal pointing cues. We found that these dogs are capable of apprehending distal pointing cues from humans. However, approximately half of the population tested showed a lack of tendency to participate even after successful familiarization with the experimental set-up. A closer inspection revealed anxious behavioural states of the individuals were responsible for such an outcome. We assume that life experiences with humans probably shape personalities of free-ranging dogs, which in turn influence their responsiveness to human communicative gestures.",778,125,251,29.0

Ligon, Edwin Scholes III, Michael J. Sheehan",739151;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/739151,"The ability to precisely describe and numerically evaluate organismal phenotypes is a prerequisite for addressing most questions in evolutionary biology and ecology. The quantification and comparison of behavior, loosely defined as an external response to stimuli, is particularly challenging because the myriad axes of variation that exist make comparisons, both within and among species, difficult. Such evaluations often boil down to comparisons of time-budgets (e.g. relative investment in courtship displays) or probabilities (e.g. likelihood of engaging in a class of behaviors in a particular context) – which we refer to as behavioral strategies. A focus on variation in behavioral strategies underlies most research in evolutionary and ecological studies of behavior. Equally important, however, is perhaps the question of ‘how’ animals are actually performing the complex motor sequences that comprise behaviors (i.e. behavioral execution). What are the patterns of movement, the relative transition rates, and kinematics underlying the behaviors exhibited in particular contexts? Understanding how behavioral execution differs among individuals, populations, and species has the potential to provide new insights into the factors shaping variation in behavior and the processes shaping behavioral evolution at different scales. Here, we propose a broad framework for comparing behavioral execution (RAD-behavior: recombining atomized, discretized behavior) that leverages string-matching/bioinformatic tools to understand phenotypic variation in behavioral execution and which holds the potential to yield novel insights about the evolutionary ecology of behavior at multiple scales.",823,318,391,26.0

Many of our research questions involve longitudinal analyses, so we were interested in a method that would provide reliable ranks across time. But how does one determine which method performs best?We attempt to answer this question by using a training-testing procedure to compare 13 different approaches for calculating dominance hierarchies (seven methods, plus 6 analytical variants of these). We assess each method’s performance, its efficiency, and the extent to which the calculated ranks obtained from the training dataset accurately predict the outcome of observed aggression in the testing dataset.We found that all methods tested performed well, despite some differences in inferred rank order. With respect to the need for a “burn-in” period to enable reliable ranks to be calculated, again, all methods were efficient and able to infer reliable ranks from the very start of the study period (i.e., with little to no burn-in period). Using a common 6-month burn-in period to aid comparison, we found that all methods could predict aggressive outcomes accurately for the subsequent 10 months. Beyond this 10-month threshold, accuracy in prediction decreased as the testing dataset increased in length. The decay was rather shallow, however, indicating overall rank stability during this period.In general, a training-testing approach allows researchers to determine the most appropriate method for their dataset, given sampling effort, the frequency of agonistic interactions, the steepness of the hierarchy, and the nature of the research question being asked. Put simply, we did not find a single best method, but our approach offers researchers a valuable tool for identifying the method that will work best for them.HighlightsAll ranking methods tested performed well at predicting future aggressive outcomes, despite some differences in inferred rank order.All ranking methods appear to be efficient in inferring reliable ranks from the very start (i.e., with little to no burn-in period), but all showed improvement as the burn-in period increased.Using a common 6-month burn-in period, we found that all methods could predict aggressive outcomes accurately for the subsequent 10 months. Beyond this threshold, accuracy in prediction decreased as the testing dataset increased in length.Switching to a data-driven approach to assign k-values, via the training/validation/testing procedure, resulted in a marked improvement in performance in the modified Elo-rating method.",1583,468,598,45.0

However, its role, if any, in mediating other migration-related phenotypes remains largely unknown. Here, we simulated variation in GMF intensity between two locations along the migration route of a nocturnal insect migrant, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, that varied by ∼5 μT (GMF50μT vs. GMF45μT) in field intensity. After one generation of exposure, we tested for changes in key morphological, behavioural and physiological traits related to migratory performance including wing dimorphism, flight capacity and positive phototaxis. Our results showed that all three morphological and behavioural phenotypes responded to a small difference in magnetic field intensity between the simulated northern vs. southern locations in ways expected along the migratory route. Consistent magnetic responses in the expression of the phototaxis-related Drosophila-like cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) gene and levels of two primary energy substrates used during flight, triglyceride and trehalose, were also found.

There is increasing evidence in community ecology that consistent intraspecific variation in behaviour changes the outcome of ecological interactions.Differences in intra- and inter-specific interactions are expected to play a major role in determining patterns of species coexistence and community structure. However, the question of whether individuals vary in their propensity to associate with heterospecifics has been neglected.We used social network analysis to characterise pattern of heterospecific associations in wild mixed-species flocks of songbirds, and assessed whether individuals adopt consistent social strategies in their broader, heterospecific, social environment. We quantified heterospecific foraging associations using data from a large automatically monitored PIT-tagged population of birds, involving more than 300 000 observations of flock membership, collected over three winters, for two tit species (Paridae), blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major.We assessed individual consistency in interspecific social preferences over both short-term (week-to-week) and longer-term (year-to-year) timescales for a total of 4610 individuals, and found that blue tits and great tits exhibited marked and consistent intraspecific differences in heterospecific social phenotypes in terms of both absolute and relative number of associates. Further, we found that these consistent differences were significantly greater than expected from spatial and temporal differences in population densities.Heterospecific associations represent a major component of the social environment for many species, and our results show that individuals vary consistently in their social decisions with respect to heterospecifics.

There are numerous navigation strategies proposed to explain the navigation paths of insects to food (flowers) or mating partners (females). In a search for a mate, the males use airborne pheromone puffs in turbulent environments around trees and vegetation. It is difficult to compare the various strategies because of a lack of a single simulation framework that can change a single parameter in time and test all the strategies against a controlled environment. This work aims at closing this gap, suggesting an open source, freely accessible simulation framework, abbreviated MothPy. We implement the simulation framework using another open source package (“pompy”) that recreates a state-of-the-art puff-based odor plume model of Farrell et al. [1]. We add four different navigation strategies to the simulation framework based on and extending the previously published models [2, 3], and compare their performance with different wind and odor spread parameters. We test a sensitivity analysis of the navigation strategies to the plume meandering and to increased turbulence levels that are effectively expressed as the elevated puff spread rates. The simulations are compared statistically and provide an interesting view on the robustness and effectiveness of various strategies. This benchmarking-ready simulation framework could be useful for the biology-oriented, as well as engineering-oriented studies, assisting to deduce the evolutionary efficient strategies and improving self-propelled autonomous systems in complex environments.",920,112,383,21.0

The existence of this “pet phenomenon” is now widely discussed because other studies performed recently have demonstrated a negative impact of owning pets or no impact at all. The main problem of many studies was the autoselection – participants were informed about the aims of the study during recruitment and later likely described their health and wellbeing according to their personal beliefs and wishes, not according to their real status. To avoid this source of bias, we did not mention pets during participant recruitment and hid the pet-related questions among many hundreds of questions in an 80-minute Internet questionnaire. Results of our study performed on a sample of on 10,858 subjects showed that liking cats and dogs has a weak positive association with quality of life. However, keeping pets, especially cats, and even more being injured by pets, were strongly negatively associated with many facets of quality of life. Our data also confirmed that infection by the cat parasite Toxoplasma had a very strong negative effect on quality of life, especially on mental health. However, the infection was not responsible for the observed negative effects of keeping pets, as these effects were much stronger in 1,527 Toxoplasma-free subjects than in the whole population. Any cross-sectional study cannot discriminate between a cause and an effect. However, because of the large and still growing popularity of keeping pets, the existence and nature of the reverse pet phenomenon deserve the outmost attention.",1444,227,264,50.0

Strategies include the use of acoustic alarms to warn whales of fishing gear. For baleen whales, responses to acoustic alarms are poorly understood. This behavioural response study compared the behaviour of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in their feeding grounds off Iceland prior to, during, and after exposure to a low-frequency whale pinger (Future Oceans) and a high-frequency seal scarer (Lofitech ltd.). Linear mixed effects models and binary generalized linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of the alarms on surface feeding, swimming speed, breathing rate, directness and dive time. We observed a significant decrease in surface feeding and a significant increase in swimming speed during exposure to the whale pinger. Changes in dive time between the phases of a trial differed significantly between individuals indicating that responses may depend on individual or behavioural state. We did not find any significant reactions in response to the seal scarer. In addition to the experimental exposures, a trial of whale pingers on a capelin purse seine net was conducted. Results from this trial showed that whales entered the net from the bottom while the pingers were attached at the top, but the encircled whales were able to locate an opening free of pingers and escape without damaging the net. Our results suggest that whale pingers may be a useful entanglement mitigation tool in humpback whale feeding grounds given that a reduction in feeding around nets likely reduces the risk of whales swimming through them. Pingers may also minimize net damage if whales are encircled by aiding the whales in finding their way out. However, given the uncertain long-term consequences of the behavioural changes reported here, whale pingers are most advisable for short-term use in conjunction with other entanglement mitigation measures.",958,228,502,41.0

Duarte, Rita Fortuna, Franck Theron, Claire Doutrelant, Damien R. Farine",739789;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/739789,"Constructing and analysing social networks data can be challenging. When designing new studies, researchers are confronted with having to make decisions about how data are collected and networks are constructed, and the answers are not always straightforward. The current lack of guidance on building a social network for a new study system might lead researchers to try several different methods, and risk generating false results arising from multiple hypotheses testing. We suggest an approach for making decisions when developing a network without jeopardising the validity of future hypothesis tests. We argue that choosing the best edge definition for a network can be made using a priori knowledge of the species, and testing hypotheses that are known and independent from those that the network will ultimately be used to evaluate. We illustrate this approach by conducting a pilot study with the aim of identifying how to construct a social network for colonies of cooperatively breeding sociable weavers. We first identified two ways of collecting data using different numbers of feeders and three ways to define associations among birds. We then identified which combination of data collection and association definition maximised (i) the assortment of individuals into ‘breeding groups’ (birds that contribute towards the same nest and maintain cohesion when foraging), and (ii) socially differentiated relationships (more strong and weak relationships than expected by chance). Our approach highlights how existing knowledge about a system can be used to help navigate the myriad of methodological decisions about data collection and network inference.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT General guidance on how to analyse social networks has been provided in recent papers. However less attention has been given to system-specific methodological decisions when designing new studies, specifically on how data are collected, and how edge weights are defined from the collected data. This lack of guidance can lead researchers into being less critical about their study design and making arbitrary decisions or trying several different methods driven by a given preferred hypothesis of interest without realising the consequences of such approaches. Here we show that pilot studies combined with a priori knowledge of the study species’ social behaviour can greatly facilitate making methodological decisions. Furthermore, we empirically show that different decisions, even if data are collected under the same context (e.g. foraging), can affect the quality of a network.",1280,101,364,29.0

These as well as certain conditions of modern husbandry may affect their wellbeing. Here we aimed to (1) evaluate effects of demographic and management factors as well as personality traits on stress reactivity of sport horses, (2) investigate if elite sport horses have elevated stress levels compared to amateur sport horses, and (3) assess whether different equestrian disciplines differentially influence horses’ adrenal cortex responsiveness. For this purpose, we visited 149 healthy elite (n=94) and amateur (n=54) sport horses in Switzerland and performed an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Additionally, a person who was familiar with the horse completed a questionnaire about demographic and management factors and horses’ personality traits. Linear models were calculated to assess associations between the questionnaire data and salivary cortisol 60 and 90 minutes after ACTH stimulation. While the model at T90 was not significant, post-stimulatory cortisol after 60 min appears most informative in line with a previous study and was significantly affected by the horses’ breed and by three management factors: “number of riders”, “hours spent outside” and “group housing” (adjusted r2 =15%, p&lt;0.001). Thoroughbred and Warmblood horses displayed an increased adrenal response compared to Franches-Montagnes horses. Horses with several riders had a less pronounced reaction than horses with one rider, and horses that spent more time outside had a decreased response compared to horses that were stabled most of the time. Horses living in groups showed higher post-stimulatory cortisol values than horses that were housed singly. However, no significant associations of cortisol responsiveness with personality traits were found, and neither the horses’ use as elite or as amateur sport horses nor the discipline had an effect on the cortisol response. This suggests that optimizing husbandry conditions may be more important for improving horses’ welfare than changing their use.",768,66,205,32.0

This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an option’s spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.",2621,775,1230,80.0

We validated the use of physically altered, cacheable food items, and determined that intraspecific pilfering among free-ranging fox squirrels (N = 23) could be assessed in the field. In this study we were able to identify specific individual squirrels who pilfered or moved caches that had been stored by a conspecific. We identified a high level of pilfering (25%) among this population. In a subsequent study, we assessed the fate of squirrel-made caches. Nineteen fox squirrels cached 294 hazelnuts with passive integrated transponder tags implanted in them. Variables collected included assessment and cache investment and protection behaviors; cache location, substrate, and conspicuousness of each cache; how long each cache remained in its original location, and the location where the cache was finally consumed. We also examined whether assessment or cache protection behaviors were related to the outcomes of buried nuts. Finally, we measured the population dynamics and heterogeneity of squirrels in this study, testing the hypothesis that cache proximity and pilferage tolerance could serve as a form of kin selection. Polymer chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze hair samples and determine relatedness among 15 squirrels, and the potential impact of relatedness on caching behavior. Results suggested that cache protection behaviors and the lifespan of a cache were dependent on the conspicuousness of a cache.

Here we demonstrate that such claim is flawed. We then study a wider range of curves beyond ellipses that can have 2/3 power law scaling.

Group living can be facilitated by social tolerance and cooperation among the group members. Social canids (e.g. wolves) display cooperative breeding, hunting, and prosocial activities in different contexts. Unlike cooperative pack-living wolves (Canis lupus lupus), their descendants, domesticated dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), show varying levels of associations from solitary to stable social groups. Free-ranging dogs are group-living but prefer to forage solitarily, hence providing an excellent opportunity for investigating social tolerance and coordinated task performance among the members in various situations. We tested 113 adult-only groups of free-ranging dogs in three different tasks to investigate group responses and performance in problem-solving situations in the presence of an unfamiliar human. Task 1 (unfamiliar, single food reward) and 2 (familiar, single food reward) examined group responses and cooperation from the perspective of familiarity, while Task 3 (familiar, multiple food rewards) enabled us to test whether increased food rewards promote social tolerance and food sharing among the group members. Regardless of significantly higher performance in Task 2 compared to Task 1, cooperation and food sharing were significantly lower in both. Task 3 revealed a strong positive correlation between food sharing and social tolerance, but not between success and social tolerance, suggesting a tendency for cooperation. We conclude that context-dependent cooperation and tolerance among group members facilitate group-living in free-ranging dogs.Significance statement Group living is a common phenomenon in the animal world where the members of a group show social tolerance and co-operative behaviours towards each other. This need for cooperative intents increases manifolds while groups face different problem-solving situations in their day to day lives. Here, we tested a large number of free-ranging dog groups to understand general cooperative intents such as social tolerance and food sharing in different problem-solving conditions. We found shreds of evidence of context-dependent cooperation and social tolerance among group members with minimal display of aggression. It is not adaptive for the dogs to fight or display aggression over resources. Alternatively, use of subtle cues such as display of dominance and subordination seem to be more plausible mechanisms for the development of efficient scavenging strategies and maintaining hierarchy.",674,126,211,25.0

Buitelaar, Jeffrey C. Glennon, Natalia Z. Bielczyk",735399;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/735399,"Quantification and parametrization of movement in animal models is widely used in behavioral paradigms. In particular, free movement of an animal in controlled conditions (e.g., the open field paradigm) is used as a proxy for indices of baseline and drug-induced behavioural changes. However, the analysis of this is often time- and labour-intensive and existing algorithms do not always classify the behaviour correctly.Here, we propose a new approach to quantify behaviour in an unconstrained environment: searching for frequent patterns (k-motifs) in the time series representing position of the subject over time. Validation of this method was performed using subchronic quinpirole-induced changes in open field experiment behaviors in rodents. Analysis of this data was performed using k-motifs as features to better classify subjects into experimental groups on the basis of behavior in the open field. Our classifier using k-motifs gives as high as 94% accuracy in classifying repetitive behaviour versus controls which is a substantial improvement compared to currently available methods including using standard feature definitions (depending on the choice of feature set and classification strategy, accuracy up to 88%). Furthermore, vizualization of the movement / time patterns is highly predictive of these behaviours. By using machine learning to create features in a data driven fashion, this can be applied to general behavioural analysis across experimental paradigms beyond the open field.",940,94,230,22.0

Distress sounds, for example, are typically uttered in distressful scenarios such as agonistic interactions. Here, we report on the occurrence of superfast temporal periodicities in distress calls emitted by bats (species Carollia perspicillata). Distress vocalizations uttered by this bat species are temporally modulated at frequencies close to 1.7 kHz, that is, ∼17 times faster than modulation rates observed in human screams. Fast temporal periodicities are represented in the bats’ brain by means of frequency following responses, and temporally periodic sounds are more effective in boosting the heart rate of awake bats than their demodulated versions. Altogether, our data suggest that bats, an animal group classically regarded as ultrasonic, can exploit the low frequency portion of the soundscape during distress calling to create spectro-temporally complex, arousing sounds.",1269,183,354,51.0

Zwiebel",614719;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/614719,"Background In eusocial ants, aggressive behaviors require a sophisticated ability to detect and discriminate between chemical signatures such as cuticular hydrocarbons that distinguish nestmate friends from non-nestmate foes. It has been suggested that a mismatch between a chemical signature (label) and the internal, neuronal representation of the colony odor (template) leads to the recognition of and subsequent aggression between non-nestmates. While several studies have demonstrated that ant chemosensory systems, most notably olfaction, are largely responsible for the decoding of these chemical signatures, a definitive demonstration that odorant receptors are responsible for the detection and processing of the pheromonal signals that regulate nestmate recognition has thus far been lacking. To address this, we have developed an aggression-based bioassay incorporating a suite of highly selective odorant receptor modulators to characterize the role of olfaction in nestmate recognition in the formicine ant Camponotus floridanus.Results Validation of our aggression-based behavioral assay was carried out by demonstrating an antennal requirement for nestmate recognition. In order to adapt this bioassay for the volatile delivery of Orco modulators, electroantennography was used to show that both a volatilized Orco antagonist (VUANT1) and an Orco agonist (VUAA4) eliminated or otherwise interfered with the electrophysiological responses to the hydrocarbon decane, respectively. Volatilize administration of these compounds to adult workers significantly reduced aggression between non-nestmates without altering aggression levels between nestmates but did not alter aggressive responses towards a mechanical stimulus.Conclusions Our studies provide direct evidence that the antennae (as olfactory appendages) and odorant receptors (at the molecular level) are necessary for mediating aggression towards non-nestmates. Furthermore, our observations support a hypothesis in which rejection of non-nestmates depends on the precise detection and decoding of chemical signatures present on non-nestmates as opposed to the absence of any information or the active acceptance of familiar signatures. In addition to describing a novel approach to assess olfactory signaling in genetically intractable insect systems, these studies contribute to a long-standing interest in odor coding and the molecular neuroethology of nestmate recognition.",1648,462,618,29.0

Behavioral responses to novel stimuli can differ strongly between closely related species; however, the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying these differences are not well understood, in part because most comparative investigations have focused on only two species. In this study, we investigate behavioral responses to novel environments, or exploratory behaviors, sampling from a total of 20 species in a previously untested vertebrate system, Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, which comprises hundreds of phenotypically diverse species that have diverged in the past one million years. We show generally conserved behavioral response patterns to different types of environmental stimuli in Lake Malawi cichlids, spanning multiple assays and paralleling other teleost and rodent lineages. Next, we demonstrate that more specific dimensions of exploratory behavior vary strongly among Lake Malawi cichlids, and that a large proportion of this variation is explained by species differences. We further show that species differences in open field behaviors are explained by microhabitat and by a major evolutionary split between the mbuna and benthic/utaka radiations in Lake Malawi. Lastly, we track some individuals across a subset of behavioral assays and show that patterns of behavioral covariation across contexts are characteristic of modular complex traits. Taken together, our results tie ecology and evolution to natural behavioral variation, and highlight Lake Malawi cichlids as a powerful system for understanding the biological basis of exploratory behaviors.",2117,372,853,54.0

However, we do not know whether the function of the avian homologue mesotocin is evolutionarily conserved across birds. While it does influence avian prosocial behavior, mesotocin’s role in avian social bonding remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether mesotocin regulates the formation and maintenance of same-sex social bonding in pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), a member of the crow family. We formed squads of four individually housed birds. In the first, ‘pair-formation’ phase of the experiment, we repeatedly placed pairs of birds from within the squad together in a cage for short periods of time. Prior to entering the cage, we intranasally administered one of three hormone solutions to both members of the pair: mesotocin, oxytocin antagonist, or saline. Pairs received repeated sessions with administration of the same hormone. In the second, ‘pair-maintenance’ phase of the experiment, all four members of the squad were placed together in a large cage, and no hormones were administered. For both phases, we measured the physical proximity between pairs as our proxy for social bonding. We found that, compared to saline, administering mesotocin or oxytocin antagonist did not result in different proximities in either the pair-formation or pair-maintenance phase of the experiment. Therefore, at the dosages and time frames used here, exogenously introduced mesotocin did not influence same-sex social bond formation or maintenance. Like oxytocin in mammals, mesotocin regulates avian prosocial behavior; however, unlike oxytocin, we do not have evidence that mesotocin regulates social bonds in birds.",1199,540,467,11.0

Under full agreement, an adjective fully agrees in number and gender with a preceding plural noun, but only when this noun is human, while it is systematically marked feminine singular when the noun is non-human under deflected agreement. We recorded grammaticality judgment and ERP responses from 32 speakers of Arabic to sentences violating full and deflected agreement and their well-formed counterparts. The participants were relatively fast and accurate in judging all the sentences, although violations, especially deflected agreement violations, were not always deemed ungrammatical. However, the ERP responses show a differential processing of human versus non-human violations. Violations of full agreement involving human nouns elicited larger N400 and P600 components than violations of deflected agreement involving non-human nouns, whose ERP signatures were hardly distinguishable from those of their acceptable counterparts. Our results present evidence for animacy (more specifically, humanness) and inter-dialect effects on language processing. We argue that violations of Standard Arabic deflected agreement are not treated as outright violations because non-human referents permit both full and deflected agreement in Spoken Arabic. We discuss these results in light of the ERP literature on agreement processing and the role of animacy/humanness in grammar, and highlight the potential effect of diglossia on the architecture of the mental grammar of Arabic speakers.",827,375,386,45.0

Raters were asked to report the time needed for any evaluation and a total score, in order to define a pain class. Pain classes (No pain, Discomfort, Moderate pain and Severe pain) matched presumptive pain classes and accordingly, the validity of the three scales was measured using Chi-square test.Patients (n=69) were evaluated by one V and one S, allowing to assess the impact that the experience has on the results. Inter-rater reliability was tested for each scale using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and for each parameter of the CANCRS using Cohen’s kappa. Validity results show that only CANCRS and RbtGS efficiently reveal pain, but both tend to underestimate it.Inter-rater reliability was very good for both CANCRS and CPS, suggesting that experience has little influence on the results; rater’s experience has a greater impact using RbtGS.Inter-rater agreement was at least good for each parameter.In conclusion, CPS alone is neither effective or reliable in quantifying pain.The RbtGS is a useful tool in clinical practice, when coping with many rabbit breeds; however, training is beneficial for a better use of the scale.The CANCRS is easy and fast to use and enrich RbtGS with some clinical parameters that should be monitored during any clinical examination, leading to a more exhaustive evaluation of the patient.",713,143,369,28.0

The main goals of this study were to 1) confirm the existence of PDMs and their unique behavioural phenotypes in the Dark Agouti (DA) and Wistar Han (WH), 2) to extend the behavioural profile of the PDMs to probability-based decision-making and social behaviours and 3) to discuss how the key traits of each strain could be relevant for biomedical research.Methods We compared cognitive abilities, natural behaviours and physiological responses in DA and WH rats using several tests. We analysed the results at the strain and the individual level.Results Previous findings in WH rats were reproduced and could be generalized to DA. Each PDM of either strain displayed a similar, naturally occurring, combination of behavioural traits, including possibly higher social rank, but no deficits in probability-based decision-making.

Sewall",504258;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/504258,"The effect of urban noise on animal communication systems is one of the best examples of how anthropogenic change affects animal social behaviour. Urban noise often drives shifts in acoustic properties of signals but the consequences of noise for the honesty of signals – that is, how well they predict signaler behaviour, is unclear. Here we examine whether honesty of aggressive signaling changes in urban living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Aggressive signaling in song sparrows consists of close-range signals in two modalities that predict a subsequent attack: the low amplitude soft songs (an acoustic signal) and wing waves (a visual signal). Male song sparrows living in urban habitats display more territorial aggression than males living in rural habitats, but whether the honesty of close-range signals is affected by urbanization has not been examined. If soft songs are less effective in urban noise, we predict that they would be less reliably associated with attack in these habitats compared to rural habitats. We found that while acoustic noise was higher in urban habitats, the urban birds still sang more soft songs than rural birds during a simulated territorial intrusion. Furthermore, high rates of soft songs and low rates of loud songs predicted attacks in both habitats. Finally, we found evidence for a potential multimodal shift: urban birds tended to give proportionally more wing waves than soft songs than rural birds. These results indicate that urbanization might have a limited effect on the overall honesty of aggressive signals in song sparrows.",1156,256,356,31.0

In the current study, we used the ANT-I (attentional network test – interactions) to examine two groups of women: naturally cycling (NC) – those with a regular menstrual cycle, and oral contraceptives (OC) – those using OC and characterized with low and steady ovarian hormone levels. We tested their performance at two time points that fit, in natural cycles, the early follicular phase and the early luteal phase. We found no differences in performance between NC and OC in low ovarian hormone states (Both phases for the OC group and early follicular phase for the NC group). However, the NC group in the early luteal phase exhibited the same pattern of responses for alerting and no-alerting conditions, resulting in a better conflict resolution (executive) when attention is oriented to the target. Results-driven exploratory regression analysis of E2 and P4 suggested that change in P4 from early follicular to early luteal phases was a mediator for the alerting effect found.

It has been shown that mosquitoes use the reactive near-field in antennae communication with negative phonotaxis in male Aedes diantaeus evoked by low frequency acoustic signals of a carrier frequency 140–200 Hz. Also, studies with the 35-60 kHz Odorrana tormota sound recorded a 46 % repellence in female Anopheles gambiae, the malaria vectors. Declining malaria morbidity and mortality is attributed to current vector and pathogen interventions. However, the rate of decline in malaria morbidity and mortality is impeded by buildup of resistance in pathogens and vectors to chemicals. This study therefore characterised animal sounds essential for further investigation in the control of malaria through mosquito startle. The research determined, analysed and compared the acoustic propagation parameters of the recorded natural sounds of the male Anopheles gambiae, female Anopheles gambiae and Odorrana tormota using Avisoft SASLAB Pro and Raven Pro 1.5. All sounds were observed to have frequency modulation with harmonics stretching to ultrasonic levels. Uniquesly, the sound of O. tormota showed constant frequency modulation. The pupae of A. gambiae were reared in vials quarter filled with water and covered with a net at 60-80 % humidity, 25±2 °C temperature and equal light-darkness hour cycle at Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) entomology laboratories.

The maximum frequency (mean) of the sounds of both sexes of A. gambiae correlated highly negative (r = −0.658). The bandwidth (end), bandwidth (maximum), bandwidth (maximum entire), peak amplitude (mean) and bandwidth (mean entire) of the sound of the male compared with female A. gambiae differed significantly. The signal power for the non-pulsate sounds of the male A. gambiae remained almost constant at 80 dB from 10 kHz to 65 kHz beyond which the acoustic energy declining to 45 dB.

In our experiments, we bound motor effort to such switching behavior during a two-alternative perceptual decision-making task and recorded the sampling patterns by computer mouse cursor tracking. We found that the time and motor cost to make the decision positively correlated with the number of switches between the stimuli and increased with the difficulty of the task. Specifically, the first and last sampled items were chosen in an attempt to minimize the overall motor effort during the task and were manipulable by biasing the relevant motor cost. Moreover, we observed the last-sampling bias that the last sampled item was more likely to be chosen by the subjects. We listed all possible Bayesian Network models for different hypotheses regarding the causal relationship behind the last-sampling bias, and only the model assuming bidirectional dependency between attention and decision successfully predicted the empirical results. Meanwhile, denying that the current decision variable can feedback into the attention switching patterns during sampling, the conventional attentional drift-diffusion model (aDDM) was inadequate to explain the size of the last-sampling bias in our experimental conditions.

To better understand variation in patterns of aggression between species, we presented males and females from five species of Lake Malawi cichlid with a non-predator intruder and recorded all movement and aggressive acts. Additionally, we measured excreted cortisol levels the day after the intruder assay to evaluate one physiological aspect of stress response. We identified species-specific patterns in both specific aggressive acts, and overall level of aggression. Additionally, we found that sexual dimorphism in aggressive acts varies by species and act, where the species with the most aggressive males also has aggressive females. Additionally, cortisol levels vary by taxa, and are associated with restless behavior in the intruder assay, but not levels of aggression.

The importance of peer social influences during adolescence on alcohol and substance use have recently received more attention. We have shown that social interaction with an alcohol-intoxicated peer influences adolescent alcohol drinking differently in male and female rats using the demonstrator-observer paradigm. The present set of experiments analyzed the social interaction session to determine behaviors that influence alcohol drinking in adolescent male and female rats.Methods Specifically, in experiment one we determined which behaviors were altered during social interaction with an alcohol-intoxicated demonstrator and assessed changes in ethanol intake in adolescent observers. Experiment two examined changes in voluntary saccharin consumption to determine if social interaction with an alcohol-intoxicated demonstrator altered consumption of a palatable solution. In experiment three, we administered a low (5 mg/kg) or high (20 mg/kg) dose of cocaine to the demonstrator and assessed changes in the adolescent observers to determine if social interaction with a ‘drugged’ peer altered social behaviors and voluntary ethanol intake.Results We showed that social interaction with an alcohol-intoxicated demonstrator (1) decreased social play and increased social investigation and social contact in adolescent male and female observers, (2) did not alter non-social behaviors, (3) did not alter saccharin consumption and (4) increased voluntary ethanol intake in adolescent female but not male observers. When the peer was injected with cocaine (1) social play was dose-dependently decreased, (2) there were no changes in other social or non-social behaviors, and (3) voluntary ethanol intake in adolescent male and female observers was unaffected.Conclusions The present results are consistent and extend our previous work showing that social interaction with an alcohol-intoxicated peer selectively alters social behaviors and alcohol-drinking in adolescent rats.

Gotanda,591651;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/591651,"1) Humans exert dramatic influences upon the environment, creating novel selective pressures to which organisms must adapt. On the Galapagos, humans have established a permanent presence and have altered selective pressures through influences such as invasive predators and urbanization, affecting iconic species such as Darwin’s finches.2) Here, I ask two key questions: (i) does antipredator behaviour (e.g. FID) change depending on whether invasive predators are historically absent, present, or eradicated? and (ii) to what degree does urbanization affect antipredator behaviour? This study is one of the first to quantify antipredator behaviour in endemic species after the eradication of invasive predators. This will help to understand the consequences of invasive predator eradication and inform conservation measures.3) I quantified flight initiation distance (FID), an antipredator behaviour, in Darwin’s finches, across multiple islands in the Galapagos that varied in the presence, absence, or successful eradication of invasive predators. On islands with human populations, I quantified FID in urban and non-urban populations of finches.4) FID was higher on islands with invasive predators compared to islands with no predators. On islands from which invasive predators were eradicated ∼11 years previously, FID was also higher than on islands with no invasive predators. Within islands that had both urban and non-urban populations of finches, FID was lower in urban finch populations, but only above a threshold human population size. FID in larger urban areas on islands with invasive predators was similar to or lower than FID on islands with no history of invasive predators.5) Overall, these results suggest that invasive predators can have a lasting effect on antipredator behaviour, even after eradication. Furthermore, the effect of urbanization can strongly oppose the effect of invasive predators, reducing antipredator behaviour to levels lower than found on pristine islands with no human influences. These results improve our understanding of human influences on antipredator behaviour which can help inform future conservation and management efforts on islands.",1505,408,574,34.0

We found stronger social bonds and more time spent grooming between maternal kin and paternal half-sisters compared to non-kin, with no preference of maternal over paternal kin. Paternally related and non-related dyads did not form stronger bonds when they had less close maternal kin available, however we would need a bigger sample size to confirm this. As expected given the low reproductive skew, bonds between paternal half-sisters closer in age were not stronger than between paternal half-sisters with larger age differences, suggesting that age similarity was not the mechanism by which paternally related individuals recognized each other. An alternative way through which paternal kin could get familiarized is mother- and/or father-mediated familiarity.",878,99,304,47.0

O’Leary, Phelan Harris, Richard E. Brown, Jason S. Snyder",715961;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/715961,"Spatial navigation is a universal behavior that varies depending on goals, experience and available sensory stimuli. Spatial navigational tasks are routinely used to study learning, memory and goal-directed behavior, in both animals and humans. One popular paradigm for testing spatial memory is the Morris water maze, where subjects learn the location of a hidden platform that offers escape from a pool of water. Researchers typically express learning as a function of the latency to escape, though this reveals little about the underlying navigational strategies. Recently, a number of studies have begun to classify water maze search strategies in order to clarify the precise spatial and mnemonic functions of different brain regions, and to identify which aspects of spatial memory are disrupted in disease models. However, despite their usefulness, strategy analyses have not been widely adopted due to the lack of software to automate analyses. To address this need we developed Pathfinder, an open source application for analyzing spatial navigation behaviors. In a representative dataset, we show that Pathfinder effectively characterizes the development of highly-specific spatial search strategies as male and female mice learn a standard spatial water maze. Pathfinder can read data files from commercially- and freely-available software packages, is optimized for classifying search strategies in water maze paradigms, but can also be used to analyze 2D navigation by other species, and in other tasks, as long as timestamped xy coordinates are available. Pathfinder is simple to use, can automatically determine pool and platform geometry, generates heat maps, analyzes navigation with respect to multiple goal locations, and can be updated to accommodate future developments in spatial behavioral analyses. Given these features, Pathfinder may be a useful tool for studying how navigational strategies are regulated by the environment, depend on specific neural circuits, and are altered by pathology.",1414,133,843,21.0

Galea",714840;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/714840,"From psychology to economics there has been substantial interest in how costs (e.g., delay, risk) are represented asymmetrically during decision-making when attempting to gain reward or to avoid punishment. For example, in decision-making under risk, individuals show a tendency to prefer to avoid punishment than to acquire the equivalent reward (loss aversion). Although the cost of physical effort has received significant recent attention due to the evaluation of motor costs being crucial in our daily decisions, it remains unclear whether loss aversion exists during effort-based decision-making. On the one hand, loss aversion may be hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains and therefore exists across decision-making contexts. On the other hand, distinct brain regions are involved with different decision costs, making it questionable whether similar asymmetries exist. Here, we demonstrate that young healthy participants exhibit loss aversion during effort-based decision-making by exerting more physical effort in order to avoid punishment than to gain a same-size reward. Next, we show that medicated Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients show a reduction in loss aversion compared to age-matched controls. Behavioural and computational analysis revealed that people with PD exerted similar physical effort in return for a reward, but were less willing to produce effort in order to avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present during effort-based decision-making and can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This finding could have important implications for our understanding of clinical disorders that show a reduced willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward.Significance Statement Loss aversion – preferring to avoid punishment than to acquire equivalent reward – is an important concept in decision-making under risk. However, little is known about whether loss aversion also exists during decisions where the cost is physical effort. This is surprising given that motor cost shapes human behaviour, and a reduced willingness to exert effort is a characteristic of many clinical disorders. Here, we show that healthy individuals exert more effort to minimise punishment than to maximise reward (loss aversion). We also demonstrate that loss aversion is modulated by altered dopaminergic state by showing that medicated Parkinson’s disease patients exert similar effort to gain reward but less effort to avoid punishment. Therefore, dopamine-dependent loss aversion is crucial for explaining effort-based decision-making.",1247,191,437,32.0

Many temperate forest species of bat appear loyal to their foraging sites however, conservation of these sites rather than just habitat types is rarely considered and is essential to protect bat populations. It is not clear whether site fidelity in bats is species-specific or a more general trait or why it is exhibited but behaviour patterns could be important for conservation and management objectives. Foraging variation may occur due to ‘individual specialisation’, such that individuals differ significantly in their prey or habitat utilisation, independent of class-effects. If bats do exhibit individuality in their habitat choice, then protection of a mosaic of habitats rather than single preferred habitat per species may be critical to their conservation.The goal here was to determine whether Natterer’s bats show fidelity in their foraging choices and whether they show individual specialisation in their foraging habits.Thirty-four individual bats were tracked for at least one full night, from two different sites.Site fidelity in Natterer’s was consistent across a range of intervals (months and years) despite contrasting seasonal contexts. Individuals repeatedly exploited specific foraging locations and showed individual specialisation in their habitat use which is consistent with the behaviour of a territorial species.Studies designed to inform conservation and management of temperate bats should attempt to maximize the number of individuals from which movement data is sought, whilst ensuring that data represent a coherent and meaningful measure of behaviour such as a single full night. Bat conservation may need to shift from general descriptions of habitat preferences to considering individual specialisation in habitat use. Designing conservation strategies resilient to environmental change might then advocate protecting a mosaic of habitats to preserve the habitat specialisms of many individuals and enhance their productivity rather than advocating the preservation of a single preferred habitat only suited to a few individuals.",785,161,283,36.0

Norman, Jonathan Cohen, Satinder Singh, Richard L. Lewis",580324;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/580324,"Humans often simultaneously pursue multiple plans at different time scales. The successful realization of non-immediate plans (e.g., post package after work) requires keeping track of a future plan while accomplishing other intermediate tasks (e.g., write a paper), a capacity known as prospective memory. This capacity requires the integration of noisy evidence from perceptual input with evidence from short-term working memory (WM) and longer-term or episodic memory (LTM/EM). Here we formulate a set of dual-task problems in empirical studies of prospective memory as problems of computational rationality, and ask how a rational model should exploit noisy perception and memory to maximize payoffs. The model combines reinforcement learning (optimal action selection) with evidence accumulation (optimal inference) in order to derive good decision parameters for optimal task performance (i.e., performing an ongoing task while monitoring for a cue that triggers executing a second prospective task). We compare model behavior to key accuracy and reaction time phenomena in human performance. Thus, we offer a normative approach to theorizing and modeling these phenomena without assumptions about mechanisms of attention or retrieval. This approach can be extended to study meta-parameters governing the boundedly rational use of memory in planned action in health, as well as compensatory mnemonic strategies that may be rational responses to disturbances of these mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders.",2439,268,928,16.0

Here we observe and analyze the microstructure of social and non-social behaviors as 21 pairs of outbred CD-1 male mice (Mus Musculus) establish dominant-subordinate relationships during daily 20-minute interaction for five consecutive days. Using Kleinberg burst detection algorithm, we demonstrate aggressive and subordinate interactions occur in bursting patterns followed by quiescence period rather than in uniformly distributed across social interactions. Further, we identify three phases of dominant-subordinate relationship development (pre-, middle-, and post-resolution) by combining phi-coefficient and difference methods used to determine at which bursting event mice resolve dominant-subordinate relationships. Using First Order Markov Chains within individuals we show dominant and subordinate animals establish significantly different behavioral repertoire once they resolve the relationships. In both dominant and subordinate mice, the transitions between investigative and agonistic behavior states are not common. Lastly, we introduce Forward Spike Time Tiling Coefficient, the strength of association between the given behavior of one individual with the target behavior of the other individual within a specified time window. With this method, we describe the likelihood of a mouse responding to a behavior with another behavior differ in pre- and post-resolution phases. The data suggest that subordinate mice learn to exhibit subordinate behavior in response to dominant partner’s behaviors while dominant mice become less likely to show subordinate behaviors in response to their partners’ action.

However, demonstrations of hierarchical organization in behavior have been scarce. Moreover, it remains unclear how such underlying organization allows for behavioral flexibility. Here we uncover the hierarchical and flexible nature of Caenorhabditis elegans behavior. By describing worm locomotion as a sequence of discrete postural templates, we identified chunks containing mutually substitutable postures along the dynamics. We then elucidated the rules governing their interactions. We found that stereotypical roaming can be described by a specific sequence of postural chunks, which exhibit flexibility at the lowest postural level. The same chunks get combined differently to produce dwelling, capturing non-stereotypical actions across timescales. We show that worm foraging is organized hierarchically —a feature not explainable via Markovian dynamics—, and derive a context-free grammar governing its behavior —which is different than a regular grammar, or a hidden Markov chain. In sum, in making the analogy with human language concrete (but not literal) our work demonstrates, in line with the foundational insights of classical ethologists, that spontaneous behavior is orderly flexible. Once more, investigating the humble nematode suggests that everything human has its roots in lower animal behavior.",2358,199,1210,49.0

It has been argued that the ability to track stimulus statistics and generate predictions supports the choice what to attend and what to ignore. However, the role of these predictions about future auditory events in drafting decisions remains elusive. While most psychophysical studies in humans indicate that expected stimuli serve as implicit cues attracting attention, most work studying physiological auditory processing in animals highlights the detection of unexpected, surprising stimuli. Here, we tested whether in the mouse, target probability is used as an implicit cue attracting attention or whether detection is biased towards low-probability deviants using an auditory detection task. We implemented a probabilistic choice model to investigate whether a possible dependence on stimulus statistics arises from short term serial correlations or from integration over longer periods. Our results demonstrate that target detectability in mice decreases with increasing probability, contrary to humans. We suggest that mice indeed track probability over a time scale of at least several minutes but do not use this information in the same way as humans do: instead of maximizing reward by focusing on high-probability targets, the saliency of a target is determined by surprise.",1660,442,422,28.0

All responses expressed a plateau stressing an adaptive limit with extreme values of SH and HBD. The minimum plateau of BR (46.9 ± 14.6 min-1) is around 40 min-1, while IR values (different for C and SR, respectively 69.1 ± 38.1 vs. 99.9 ± 45.7 g/min/kg BW) ranged between a minimum and maximum plateau around 50 and 100 g/min/kg BW. Two other pasture management factors affect IR, namely forage allowance (10.16 ± 6.0, DM % BW) and daily proportion of time spent grazing (0.30 ± 0.08). The results obtained confirm the specifically key role of BM (1.80 ± 127 mg DM/kg BW) on IR. The regressions are IR=145 (1-exp (-b BM), b being equal respectively for C and SR and C to 0.44 vs. 0.54. This literature review has also revealed fundamental differences in behaviour between C and SR although no study to date has attempted to compare them simultaneously. SR have to chew more (2.7 ± 1.2 vs. 1.6 ± 0.5 JM/bite) to ingest the same amount of DM per bite than C, expressed in relation to BW, which allow them to ingest slightly quickly.Implications This article, following the previous one of Boval and Sauvant (2019), proposes a quantitative appraisal of the ingestive behaviour of grazing ruminants, based on studies published over 40 years, as well as well robust average values and relationships, considering inter- and intra-study effects and animal species specificities.

IDUA codes for α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), a lysosomal hydrolase that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate. GAGs are structural and signalling molecules that have a crucial role in controlling a variety of cell functions and their interaction with extracellular matrix. Because of GAG’s widespread action in cellular metabolism, MPS I is a progressive and disabling multisystemic disorder. Nowadays, the therapies availability allowed patients to reach the adult life and the consequences of the disease in their reproductive system is still little known. We aimed to investigate whether IDUA disruption influences sexual behaviour and sexual steroid production in male and female MPS I mice. We used 3 and 6-month-old male and 3-month-old female Idua+/_ and Idua−/− mice to evaluate typical rodent copulatory behaviours. In males we observed the frequency and latency of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations. In females we evaluated the lordosis quotient. We also analysed the locomotor capacity of mice in the open field test, since copulatory behaviour requires mobility. We also quantified steroidal hormonal levels in plasmatic samples. We detected an increase in the latencies of intromissions in male copulatory behaviour of Idua−/− males when compared to Idua+/_. However, the number of intromissions was not statistically different between groups. No parameter of female sexual behaviour was statistically different between control and knockout females. In both sexes, we detected diminished mobility in Idua−/− mice. Plasma hormone levels did not differ between Idua+/_ and Idua−/− mice, both in males and females. We concluded that in the considered time point of MPS I progression, mice are able to perform sexual behaviour, but the male performance may be influenced due to the motor disability predicted to MPS I.",702,83,172,23.0

Bonnet",705921;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/705921,"Ticks are strict hematophagous arthropods and are the most important vectors of pathogens affecting both domestic and wild animals worldwide. Moreover, they are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of human pathogens. Hard tick feeding is a slow process—taking up to several days for repletion prior to detachment—and necessitates extended control over the host response. The success of the feeding process depends upon injection of saliva by tick, which not only controls host haemostasis and wound healing, but also subverts the host immune response to avoid tick rejection during this long-lasting process. In turn, the manipulation of the host immune response creates a favourable niche for the survival and propagation of diverse tick-borne pathogens transmitted during feeding. Here, we report on the molecular and biochemical features and functions of IrSPI, an Ixodes ricinus salivary serine protease inhibitor involved in blood meal acquisition. Our results show that IrSPI harbours the typical conformational fold of Kunitz type I serine protease inhibitors and that it functionally inhibits the elastase and, to a lesser extent, chymotrypsin. We also show that IrSPI is injected into the host during feeding. Crucially, we found that IrSPI has no impact on tissue factor pathway-induced coagulation, fibrinolysis, apoptosis, or angiogenesis, but a strong effect on immune cells. IrSPI affects antigen-presenting macrophages by hampering IL-5 production. In addition, IrSPI represses proliferation of mitogen-stimulated CD4+ cells. The inhibition of T cell proliferation was associated with marked reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Our study contributes valuable knowledge to tick-host interactions and provides insights that could be further exploited to design anti-tick vaccines targeting this immunomodulator implicated in successful I. ricinus tick feeding.Author summary Ticks are the most important vector influencing both human and animal health in Europe, where Ixodes ricinus is the most abundant tick species. Ticks feed on animal or human blood for an extended period, during which their saliva allows both feeding and pathogen transmission by interfering with native host responses. A better understanding of tick-host-pathogen interactions is central to the discovery of improved control methods. Within this context, we previously identified IrSPI as an I. ricinus salivary molecule implicated in both tick feeding and bacterial transmission. This serine protease inhibitor was almost characterised as an elastase inhibitor, and here, we show IrSPI overexpression in several tick organs—especially salivary glands—during blood feeding. We demonstrate that IrSPI is injected into the host through saliva, and despite having no impact on endothelial cell angiogenesis or apoptosis during blood feeding, we report an immunomodulatory role, whereby CD4+ T lymphocyte proliferation is repressed and where the cytokine secretion pattern of both splenocytes and macrophages is modified. Our study provides new insights into the complex armament developed by ticks to overcome the host response, and uncovers a potential vaccine target for disruption of feeding processes and pathogen transmission.",1051,238,615,53.0

There is also evidence that network structures can show temporal dynamics, suggesting that consistency in social network position across time does not preclude some form of plasticity in response to environmental variation. To better consider variation in network position and plasticity simultaneously we introduce the network reaction norm (NRN) approach. As an illustrative example, we used behavioural data on chacma baboons, collected over a period of seven years, to construct a time series of networks, using a moving window. Applying an NRN approach with these data, we found that most of the variation in network centrality could be explained by inter-individual differences in mean centrality. There was also evidence, however, for individual differences in network plasticity. These differences suggest that environmental conditions may influence which individuals are most central, i.e., they lead to an individual x environment interaction. We suggest that expanding from measures of repeatability in social networks to network reaction norms can provide a more temporally nuanced way to investigate social phenotypes within groups, and lead to a better understanding of the development and maintenance of individual variation in social behaviour.",1112,92,297,28.0

The sensory traps and sensory bias models have proven valuable for explaining how visual systems and environments shape the design of sexual signals, but their application to deceptive signals is largely untapped. Here we use the ‘jewelled’ orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata to experimentally test two longstanding hypotheses for the function of deceptive visual lures. Namely, that they: (1) exploit generalised preferences for conspicuous colouration (sensory bias), or (2) co-opt the otherwise-adaptive foraging response of prey toward flowers (sensory traps). In a field-based study we manipulated the conspicuous dorsal signal of female spiders along two axes —– colour pattern and symmetry — to generate a gradient of floral resemblance, and monitored the per-individual consequences for prey interception. As predicted by the traps model, the most attractive phenotypes were those with flower-like radial symmetry and solid colour patterns, and their attractiveness equaled that of wild-type models. These results demonstrate that deceptive orb-web spider lures function, in part, as inter-kingdom sensory traps via floral mimicry, and support the broader extension of sensory-based models to deceptive signalling contexts.",1261,304,427,21.0

Investigating how animals employ such metaheuristics while solving self-guided natural problems is a fertile area for biologically inspired algorithm development.

Using this system we precisely manipulated the strength of prior information available to animals as well as the complexity of the problem. We find that rats are capable of efficiently solving this problem, even under conditions in which prior information is unreliable and the space of possible solutions is large.

Surprisingly, in the field of biosonar this aspect of prey detection, which is probably very common, has received little to no attention. Here, we combine computer simulations and actual echo measurements to accurately estimate the echo intensity of insect swarms of different size and density. We show that swarm echo intensity increases with 3dB for every doubling of insect number, irrespective of swarm density. Thus swarms will be much easier to detect than single insects. Many of the insects bats eat are so small that they are only detectable by echolocation at very short distances. By focusing on detection of swarms of insects, a bat may increase its operating range and diversify its diet. Interestingly, interference between the sound waves reflected from a swarm of insects can sometimes result in echoes that are much weaker than echoes from single insects. We show that bats can reduce this problem by increasing the bandwidth of their echolocation calls. Specifically, a bandwidth of 3-8 kHz would guarantee receiving loud echoes from any angle relative to the swarm. Indeed, many bat species, and specifically bats hunting in open spaces, where swarms are abundant, use echolocation signals with a bandwidth of several kHz. Our results might also explain how the first echolocating bats that probably had limited echolocation abilities, could detect insects through swarm hunting.",1715,225,751,31.0

As part of an ongoing effort to develop tools for the integrated management of this fly, our objective was to determine its long and short-range responses to bacterial and yeast cues associated with adult P. downsi. We hypothesized that the bacterial and yeast communities will elicit attraction at distance through volatiles, and appetitive responses upon contact. Accordingly, we amplified bacteria from guts of adult field-caught individuals and bird feces, and yeasts from fermenting papaya juice (a known attractant of P. downsi), on selective growth media, and assayed the response of flies to these microbes or their exudates. In the field, we baited traps with bacteria or yeast and monitored adult fly attraction. In the laboratory, we used the Proboscis Extension Response (PER) to determine the sensitivity of males and females to tarsal contact with bacteria or yeast. Long range trapping efforts yielded two female flies over 112 trap nights (one in extracts from bird faeces and one in extracts from gut bacteria from adult flies).

Field releases of modified mosquitoes for population transformation rely on successful host-seeking by female mosquitoes, but host-seeking ability is rarely tested in a realistic context. We tested the host-seeking ability of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using a semi-field system. Females with different Wolbachia infection types (wMel-, wAlbB-infected and uninfected) or from different origins (laboratory and field) were released at one end of a semi-field cage and recaptured as they landed on human experimenters fifteen meters away. Mosquitoes from each population were then identified with molecular tools or through marking with a consistent weight of fluorescent powder. Wolbachia-infected and uninfected populations had similar average durations to landing and overall recapture proportions, as did laboratory and field-sourced A. aegypti. These results suggest that the host-seeking ability of mosquitoes is not negatively affected by Wolbachia infection or long-term laboratory maintenance. This method provides an approach to study the host-seeking ability of mosquitoes across a long distance which will be useful when evaluating strains of mosquitoes that are planned for releases into the field to suppress arbovirus transmission. An adjustment of this method may also be useful in sterile insect release programs because male host-seeking and swarming around female feeding sites can also be investigated.",934,115,334,28.0

Although free-ranging primates do show signs of reciprocity, experiments in more controlled environments have mainly failed to reproduce such social dynamics. Hence, the cognitive and neural processes allowing monkeys to reciprocate during social exchanges remains elusive. Here, pairs of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) took turns into a social decision task involving the delivery of positive (juice reward) or negative (airpuff) outcomes. By analyzing the contingencies of one partner’s past decisions on the other’s future decisions, we demonstrate the presence of reciprocity, but only for the exchange of negative outcomes. Importantly, to display this decisional bias, the monkey needs to witness its partner’s decisions, since non-social deliveries of the same outcome did not have such effect. Withholding of negative outcomes also predicted future social decisions, which suggest that the observed tit-for-tat strategy may not only be motivated by retaliation after receiving an airpuff but also by the gratefulness of not having received one. These results clarify the apparent dichotomy within the scientific literature of reciprocity in non-human primates and suggest that their social cognition comprise revenge and gratitude.",679,90,303,14.0

The aim of this study was to further describe the training conditions under which the stimuli acquire control over temporal performance. We manipulated the number of consecutive trials of each fixed interval (FI) per training block (Experiment I) and the number of FIs trained (Experiment II). The results suggest that when trained in blocks of several consecutive trials of the same FI, temporal performance is controlled by temporal regularities across trials and not by the visual stimuli that signal the FIs. One possible account for those data is that the temporal cues overshadow the visual stimuli for the control of temporal performance.

The neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) has been proposed to promote both bonding and cooperation although only a limited number of studies have investigated this under natural conditions. Our aim was to assess the role of OT in bonding and cooperation in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). First we tested for an effect of affiliation - grooming and triadic male-infant-male interactions - with bond and non-bond partners on urinary OT levels. Secondly we aimed to test whether grooming interactions (and thus increased OT levels) increase a male’s general propensity to cooperate in polyadic conflicts. We collected behavioral data via full-day focal animal protocols on 14 adult males and measured endogenous OT levels from 139 urine samples collected after affiliation and non-social control periods. Urinary OT levels were higher after grooming with any partner. By contrast, OT levels after male-infant-male interactions with any partner or with bond partners were not different from controls but were higher after interactions with non-bond partners. Previous grooming did not increase the likelihood of males to support others in conflicts. Collectively, our results support research indicating that OT is involved in the regulation of adult social bonds, including in non-reproductive contexts. However, our male-infant-male interaction results go against previous studies suggesting that it is affiliation with bond rather than non-bond partners that trigger the release of OT. Alternatively, OT levels may have been elevated prior to male-infant-male interactions thus facilitating interaction between non-bond partners. The lack of an association of grooming (and by extension increased OT levels) and subsequent support speaks against an OT linked increase in the general propensity to cooperate, yet further studies are needed for a more direct test including the possibility of partner-specific contingent cooperation.",879,176,421,30.0

This is especially true for species found in tropical dry forests, which are widely distributed and comprise diverse habitats that remain largely unprotected. Evidence suggests that some primate species endemic to tropical dry forests may be more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance than others, but our ability to predict primate abundance in the face of disturbance also depends on the specific variables for each site. Here, we consider the factors that explain the high density of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) found in the Taboga Forest, Costa Rica, a relatively small fragment of tropical dry forest surrounded by agricultural fields. Our analyses suggest that, for capuchins (and potentially for mantled howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata), the size and disturbance of a forest fragment may matter less than the composition and availability of key resources, like above-ground water. Group sightings for both species were higher near permanent water sources, but group sightings did not vary between edge and interior forest. These findings help explain why some primate species can flourish even alongside anthropogenic disturbance and thus carry important implications for conservation efforts. Smaller forest fragments, like Taboga, may be able to support high densities of some species because they provide a mosaic of habitats and key resources that buffer adverse ecological conditions. Future studies will assess the extent to which primates in the Taboga Forest rely on the canals versus the river and will consider how the high density of capuchins in Taboga influences ranging patterns, home range overlap, and the frequency and intensity of intergroup encounters.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSHere we introduce a new white-faced capuchin study site in the Taboga Forest, Costa Rica, a fragmented tropical dry forest.Forest fragments like Taboga may support high primate densities because they provide a mosaic of habitats and key resources.",674,144,371,35.0

Most animals can derive directional information from spatial or temporal changes in stimulus intensity (e.g. chemo- and thermo-taxis). However, some biologically relevant stimuli have constant intensity at most organismal scales. The gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth are examples of uniform stimuli that remain constant at most relevant scales. While devoid of information associated with intensity changes, the vectorial nature of these fields intrinsically encodes directional information. While much is known about behavioral strategies that exploit changes in stimulus intensity (gradients), less is understood about orientation to uniform stimuli. Nowhere is this truer than with magnetic orientation. While many organisms are known to orient to the magnetic field of the earth, how these animals extract information from the earth’s magnetic field remains unresolved.Here we use the nematode C. elegans to investigate behavioral strategies for orientation to magnetic fields, and compare our findings to the better characterized chemical and thermal orientation strategies. We used an unbiased cluster analysis to categorize, quantify, and compare behavioral components underlying different orientation strategies as a way to quantify and compare animal orientation to distinct stimuli. We find that in the presence of an earth-like magnetic field, worms perform acute angle turns (140-171°) that significantly improved their alignment with the direction of an imposed magnetic vector. In contrast, animals performed high amplitude turns (46-82°) that significantly increased alignment of their trajectory with the preferred migratory angle. We conclude that C. elegans orients to earth-strength magnetic fields using two independent behavioral strategies, in contrast to orientation strategies to graded stimuli. Understanding how C. elegans detects and orients to magnetic fields will provide useful insight into how many species across taxa accomplish this fascinating sensory feat.",930,718,428,27.0

It has been hypothesized that sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders are manifestations of differences in basic reward processing. However, preclinical models often present rewards in isolation, ignoring that ethologically, reward seeking requires the consideration of potential aversive outcomes.Methods We developed a Multidimensional Cue Outcome Action Task (MCOAT) to dissociate motivated action from cue learning and valence. Mice are trained in a series of operant tasks. In phase 1, mice acquire positive and negative reinforcement in the presence of discrete discriminative stimuli. In phase 2, both discriminative stimuli are presented concurrently allowing us to parse innate behavioral strategies based on reward seeking and shock avoidance. Phase 3 is punished responding where a discriminative stimulus predicts that nose-poking for sucrose occurs concurrently with footshock, allowing for the assessment of how positive and negative outcomes are relatively valued.Results Females prioritize avoidance of negative outcomes over seeking positive, while males have the opposite strategy. In cases where rules are uncertain, males and females employ different strategies, with females demonstrating bias for shock avoidance.Conclusions The MCOAT has broad utility for neuroscience research where pairing this task with recording and manipulation techniques will allow for the definition of the discrete information encoded within cellular populations.

Still, we know little about the factors underlying group performance, which may be reduced to three major dimensions: (a) the individual’s ability to perform a task, (b) the dependency on environmental conditions, and (c) the perception of, and the reaction to, other group members. In our research, we investigated how these dimensions interrelate in simulated evolution experiments using adaptive agents equipped with Markov brains (“animats”). We evolved the animats to perform a spatial-navigation task under various evolutionary setups. The last generation of each evolution simulation was tested across modified conditions to evaluate and compare the animats’ reliability when faced with change. Moreover, the complexity of the evolved Markov brains was assessed based on measures of information integration. We found that, under the right conditions, specialized animats were as reliable as animats already evolved for the modified tasks, that interaction between animats was dependent on the environment and on the design of the animats, and that the task difficulty influenced the correlation between the performance of the animat and its brain complexity. Generally, our results suggest that the interrelation between the aforementioned dimensions is complex and their contribution to the group’s task performance, reliability, and brain complexity varies, which points to further dependencies. Still, our study reveals that balancing the group size and individual cognitive abilities prevents over-specialization and can help to evolve better reliability under unknown environmental situations.Author Summary The ability to adapt to environmental changes is an essential attribute of organisms which have had evolutionary success. We designed a simulated evolution experiment to better understand the relevant features of such organisms and the conditions under which they evolve: First, we created diverse groups of cognitive systems by evolving simulated organisms (“animats”) acting in groups on a spatial-navigation task. Second, we post-evolutionary tested the final evolved animats in new environments–not encountered before– in order to test their reliability when faced with change. Our results imply that the ability to generalize to environments with changing task demands can have complex dependencies on the cognitive design and sensor configuration of the organism itself, as well as its social or environmental conditions.",529,81,172,52.0

McAdam, Ben Dantzer",465187;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/465187,"Individuals vary in their behavioral and physiological responses to environmental changes. These behavioral responses are often described as ‘coping styles’ along a proactive-reactive continuum. Studies in laboratory populations often, but not always, find that behavioral responses and physiological responses to stressors covary, where more proactive (more aggressive and active) individuals have a lower physiological stress response, specifically as measured by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. These studies support the possibility of hormonal pleiotropy underlying the presentation of behaviors that make up the proactive-reactive phenotype. However, recent research in wild populations is equivocal, with some studies reporting the same pattern as found in many controlled laboratory studies, whereas others do not. We tested the hypothesis that physiological and behavioral stress responses are correlated in wild adult North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We used fecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) as a non-invasive, integrated estimate of circulating glucocorticoids for our measurement of HPA axis activity. We found that FCM concentrations were not correlated with three measures of behavioral coping styles (activity, aggression, and docility) among individuals. This does not support the hypothesis that hormonal pleiotropy underlies a proactive-reactive continuum of coping styles. Instead, our results support the “two-tier” hypothesis that behavioral and physiological stress responses are independent and uncorrelated traits among individuals in wild populations that experience naturally varying environments rather than controlled environments. If also found in other studies, this may alter our predictions about the evolutionary consequences of behavioral and endocrine coping styles in free-living animals.Significance Statement Individuals vary in how they respond to stressors through behavior and physiology, but we find the two responses are independent in wild animals. Many laboratory studies find links between the behavioral and physiological stress responses, however studies conducted with wild populations are less conclusive. In wild North American red squirrels, independence between the physiological response and behavioral response may allow adaptive responses to a changing environment without pleiotropic constraint.",1273,299,474,38.0

However, given the vast array of potential scent contaminants, individually testing pollutants is an ineffective approach. The ability to quantitatively measure how much scent-pollution of a floral-odor bumblebees can tolerate would represent a paradigm shift in odor-pollution studies. Current statistical methods for analyzing complex odors have poor predictive power because statistically-derived odor-spaces are rewritten when new odors are added. This study presents an alternative method of analyzing complex odor blends based on the encoding properties of insect olfactory systems. This “Compounds Without Borders” (CWB) method vectorizes odors in a multidimensional space representing relevant functional group and carbon characteristics of their component odorants. A single vector can be built for any scent, which allows the angular distance between any two odors to be calculated – including a learned odor and its polluted counterpart. Data presented here indicate that CWB-angles are capable of both describing and predicting bumblebee odor-discrimination behavior: odor pairs with angular distances in the 20-29° range are generalized, while odor pairs over 30 degrees are differentiated. The neurophysiological properties underlying CWB-vectorization of odors are not unique to bumblebees; CWB-angle analysis of published data on a hawkmoth supports the idea that this method may have broader applications.",904,131,217,19.0

Our results revealed a significant positive correlation between boldness and activity in this species when tested in isolation. However, boldness was positively correlated with the time spent near the individual conspecific but not with the individual alien invasive heterospecific tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). Although juvenile Deccan mahseer exhibited significant variation in the preference towards conspecific over heterospecific, no divergence in the utilization of right or left eye was seen while observing these individuals suggesting the lack of lateralized utilization of the brain hemispheres. Furthermore, laterality in visual preference failed to show any significant correlation with any of the personality traits tested in this species. Results are discussed in the light of the existing literature on the impact of life in homogenous hatchery conditions on the behaviour, personality traits and cognitive abilities of fishes.Significance statement The present study is one of the first that focuses on personality and lateralization in Deccan Mahseers, an endangered freshwater megafish.

By mapping one’s own expectations, desires and intentions on the object of joint attention, humans develop a Theory of (the other’s) Mind (TOM), a functional sequence possibly disrupted in autism. Although old world monkeys probably do not possess a TOM, they follow the other’s gaze and they establish joint attention. Gaze following of both humans and old world monkeys fulfills Fodor’s criteria of a domain specific function and is orchestrated by very similar cortical architectures, strongly suggesting homology. Also new world monkeys, a primate suborder that split from the old world monkey line about 35 million years ago, have complex social structures. One member of this group, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), has received increasing interest as a potential model in studies of normal and disturbed human social cognition. Marmosets are known to follow human head-gaze. However, the question is if they use gaze following to establish joint attention with conspecifics. Here we show that this is indeed the case. In a free choice task, head-restrained marmosets prefer objects gazed at by a conspecific and, moreover, they exhibit considerably shorter choice reaction times for the same objects. These findings support the assumption of an evolutionary old domain specific faculty shared within the primate order and they underline the potential value of marmosets in studies of normal and disturbed joint attention.HIGHLIGHTSCommon marmosets follow the head gaze of conspecifics in order to establish joint attention.Brief exposures to head gaze are sufficient to reallocate an animal’s attention.The tendency to follow the other’s gaze competes with the attractional binding of the conspecific’s face",714,91,206,17.0

Hunt",497198;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/497198,"At a macroscopic level, part of the ant colony life-cycle is simple: a colony collects resources; these resources are converted into more ants, and these ants in turn collect more resources. Because more ants collect more resources, this is a multiplicative process, and the expected logarithm of the amount of resources determines how successful the colony will be in the long run. Over 60 years ago, Kelly showed, using information theoretic techniques, that the rate of growth of resources for such a situation is optimised by a strategy of betting in proportion to the probability of payoff. Thus, in the case of ants the fraction of the colony foraging at a given location should be proportional to the probability that resources will be found there, a result widely applied in the mathematics of gambling. This theoretical optimum generates predictions for which collective ant movement strategies might have evolved. Here, we show how colony level optimal foraging behaviour can be achieved by mapping movement to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, specifically Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMC). This can be done by the ants following a (noisy) local measurement of the (logarithm of) the resource probability gradient (possibly supplemented with momentum, i.e. a propensity to move in the same direction). This maps the problem of foraging (via the information theory of gambling, stochastic dynamics and techniques employed within Bayesian statistics to efficiently sample from probability distributions) to simple models of ant foraging behaviour. This identification has broad applicability, facilitates the application of information theory approaches to understanding movement ecology, and unifies insights from existing biomechanical, cognitive, random and optimality movement paradigms. At the cost of requiring ants to obtain (noisy) resource gradient information, we show that this model is both efficient, and matches a number of characteristics of real ant exploration.",1500,312,504,30.0

Czaczkes",680959;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/680959,"Humans usually assess things not in terms of absolute value, but relative to reference points. The framing of alternatives can strongly affect human decision-making, leading to different choices depending on the context within which options are presented. Similar reference-point effects have been recently reported in ants, in which foragers show a contrast effect: ants overvalue a medium-quality food source if they were expecting a poor one, and vice versa for expectations of good food. However, studies of human consumer psychology have demonstrated that expectations, for example from product labels, can drive value perception in the other direction via assimilation. For example, an expensive bottle of wine is perceived as more enjoyable compared to a cheaper bottle, even if the wine is the same. In this study, we demonstrate a similar labelling-association effect in an insect: ants showed assimilation effects by spending twice as long drinking at a medium quality food source if it was scented with an odour previously associated with high quality than if it was scented with a poor-quality label. The presence of odour cues in the food during consumption and evaluation is critical, as without them, odour-driven expectations of quality result in contrast, not assimilation effects. The addition of a quality label in the food thus reverses contrast effects and causes value to be aligned with expectations, rather than being contrasted against them. As value judgement is a key element in decision-making, relative value perception strongly influences which option is chosen, and ultimately how choices are made.",761,142,343,24.0

The rewards of gesturing can be measured through the rates of displacement behaviour made in response to these gestures by the recipient. We tested hypothesis that gestural communication affects social affiliation after controlling for kinship and demography in wild, adult chimpanzees living in Budongo Forest, Uganda. We found that affiliative but not antagonistic gestures positively predicted social affiliation. Contexts differed in their association with gestures according to complexity and association with displacement behaviour. More complex, less intense gestures predicted mutual grooming, travel, visual attention whereas less complex, more intense gestures predicted unidirectional grooming. Mirroring these patterns, reduced displacement activity occurred in response to gestures associated with unidirectional grooming but not other contexts. We highlight that these tactical decisions that wild chimpanzees make in their use of gestural communication may be driven by complexity of social environment that influences effectiveness with which signalers can influence the recipient.",804,206,277,170.0

Conversely, animal studies, typically utilizing forced/continuous alcohol (EtOH) access, tend to show that EtOH intake mitigates HFD-induced effects on insulin and glucose function, while HFD decreases voluntary EtOH intake in continuous access models. However, the impact of HFD on intermittent EtOH intake and resultant changes to metabolic function are not well characterized. The present studies sought to determine if HFD alters EtOH intake in male C57Bl/6J mice given differing two-bottle choice EtOH access schedules, and to assess resultant impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. In the first experiment, mice had Unlimited Access EtOH (UAE)+HFD (n=15; HFD=60% calories from fat, 10% EtOH v/v, ad libitum) or UAE+Chow (n=15; control diet=16% calories from fat, ad libitum) for 6 weeks. UAE+HFD mice had lower EtOH preference, consumed significantly less EtOH, and were insulin resistant and hyperglycemic compared with UAE+Chow mice. In the second experiment, mice had Limited Access EtOH (LAE, 4 hrs/d; 3 d/wk)+HFD (n=15) or LAE+Chow (n=15) with increasing EtOH concentrations (10%, 15%, 20%). LAE+HFD mice had no difference in total EtOH consumption compared to LAE+Chow mice, but exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. In the third experiment, mice had intermittent HFD access (single 24 hr session/week) with limited access to EtOH (iHFD-E, 4hrs/d; 4 d/wk) (n=10). iHFD-E mice displayed binge eating behaviors and consumed significantly more EtOH than mice given ad libitum chow or HFD, suggesting transfer of binge eating to binge drinking behaviors. Although iHFD-E mice did not have significantly altered body composition, they developed insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance.

We investigated whether various organizational levels of resting interactions (individual, sub-group, group), observed at different intervals leading up to a collective prey attack, impacted the predation speed of colonies of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. We found that in adult spiders overall group connectivity (average degree) increased group attack speed. However, this effect was detected only immediately before the predation event; connectivity two and four days before prey capture had little impact on the collective dynamics. Significantly, lower social proximity of the group’s boldest individual to other group members (closeness centrality) immediately prior and two days before prey capture was associated with faster attack speeds. These results suggest that for adult spiders, the long-lasting effects of the boldest individual on the group’s attack dynamics are mediated by its role in the social network, and not only by its boldness. This suggests that behavioural traits and social network relationships should be considered together when defining keystone individuals in some contexts. By contrast, for subadult spiders, while the group maximum boldness was negatively correlated with latency to attack, no significant resting network predictors of latency to attack were found. Thus, separate behavioural mechanisms might play distinctive roles in determining collective outcomes at different developmental stages, timescales, and levels of social organization.Significance statement Certain animals in a group, such as leaders, may have a more important role than other group members in determining their collective behavior. Often these individuals are defined by their behavioral attributes, for example, being bolder than others.

Here, we rule out these explanations, as well as effects on the nervous system more generally, and find instead that the effects of yellow on male mating success are mediated by its effects on pigmentation of male-specific leg structures called sex combs. Loss of yellow expression in these modified bristles reduces their melanization, which changes their structure and causes difficulty grasping females prior to copulation.

We characterized differences in neural induction, gene expression in active neurons, and activity of specific neuronal types in three species with distinct parental care patterns: male uniparental, female uniparental, and biparental. We identified the medial pallium and preoptic area as core brain regions associated with parental care, independent of sex and species.

We used automated telemetry to monitor &gt; 36,000 cooperative interactions among male manakins over three field seasons, and we examined how circulating testosterone affects cooperation using &gt; 500 hormone samples. Observational data show that in non-territorial floater males, high testosterone is associated with increased cooperative behaviors and subsequent ascension to territorial status. In territory-holding males, however, both observational and experimental evidence demonstrate that high testosterone antagonizes cooperation. Moreover, circulating testosterone explains significant variation (2-8%) in social behavior within each status class. Collectively, our findings show that the hormonal control of cooperation depends on a male’s social status. We propose that the status-dependent reorganization of hormone-regulatory pathways can facilitate stable cooperative partnerships, and thus provide direct fitness benefits for males.",1695,309,607,33.0

Zebrafish larvae swim in punctuated bouts separated by longer periods of rest called interbout intervals. We take advantage of this structure by categorizing bouts into discrete types and representing their behavior as labeled sequences of bout-types emitted over time. We then construct probabilistic models – specifically, marked renewal processes – to evaluate how bout-types and interbout intervals are selected by the fish as a function of its internal hunger state, behavioral history, and the locations and properties of nearby prey. Finally, we evaluate the models by their predictive likelihood and their ability to generate realistic trajectories of virtual fish swimming through simulated environments.

We evaluated adult mice with and without gonads, using a version of an operant reversal-learning task (RLT) that can be used to measure various facets of learning, impulsivity and attention.

Is this because they are physical boundaries (barriers to movement), or because they present certain visual features, such as visually extended 3D surfaces? Here, these two factors were dissociated by using immersive virtual reality and real boundaries. Eighty adults recalled target locations in one of four environments: plywood, where a virtual wall coincided with a large piece of real plywood; pass through, where the virtual wall coincided with empty space and participants could pass through it; pass over, where the virtual wall was projected downward to be visible underneath a transparent floor; and cones, where the walls were replaced with traffic cones. One condition had features that were boundaries and looked like boundaries (plywood); two had features that were not boundaries but looked like boundaries (pass over/through); and one had features that were not boundaries and did not look like boundaries (cones). The precision and bias of responses changed only as a function of looking like a boundary.

At the song level, we identified two trade-offs, but their limits were less well-defined than the note-level limits. Trade-offs at both levels suggest that song structure is constrained by limits to the speed of both frequency modulation (while vocalizing and between notes) and respiration.

However, most formulations neglect adaptations to threat that are not specific to those associations. In order to incorporate non-associative responses to threat, we propose a computational theory of PTSD based on adaptation to the frequency of traumatic events using a reinforcement learning momentum model. Recent threat prediction errors generate momentum that influences subsequent threat perception in novel contexts. This model fits data acquired from a mouse model of PTSD, in which unpredictable footshocks in one context accelerate threat learning in a novel context. The theory is also consistent with epidemiological data showing that PTSD incidence increases with the number of traumatic events, as well as the disproportionate impact of early life trauma. Since the theory proposes that PTSD relates to the average of recent threat prediction errors rather than the strength of a specific association, it makes novel predictions for the treatment of PTSD.",1097,270,623,27.0

Most likely, Japan would be invaded from Fujian and Zhejiang on 1 June – 15 July, and Kyushu, Shikoku and south-western Honshu could face the highest risk of S. frugiperda’s invasion. Korea would be most possibly reached by S. frugiperda from northern Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong on 1 June – 15 July and later. Our results indicated a very high risk that S. frugiperda would annually invade Japan and the Korean Peninsula and cause a possible significant decrease in agricultural productivity.",1513,232,688,30.0

The origins of such variability are not known but recent work highlights that variations in environmental harshness may play a key role. A growing body of experimental work in evolutionary psychology suggests that humans adapt to their specific environment by calibrating their life-history strategy. In this paper, we apply structural equation models to test the association between current and childhood environmental harshness, life-history strategy and adult cooperation in two large-scale datasets (the World Values Survey and the European Values Study). The present study replicates existing research linking a harsher environment (both in adulthood and in childhood) with a modulated reproduction-maintenance trade-off and extends these findings to the domain of collective actions. Specifically, we find that a harsher environment (both in adulthood and in childhood) is associated with decreased involvement in collective action and that this association is mediated by individuals’ life-history strategy.",966,135,436,38.0

Feary",654624;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/654624,"Despite increasing environmental variability within marine ecosystems, little is known about how coral reef fish species will cope with future climate scenarios. The Arabian/Persian Gulf is an extreme environment, providing an opportunity to study fish behaviour on reefs with seasonal temperature ranges which include both values above the mortality threshold of Indo-Pacific reef fish, and values below the optimum temperature for growth. Summer temperatures in the Gulf are comparable to those predicted for the tropical ocean by 2090-2099. Using field observations in winter, spring and summer, and laboratory experiments, we examined the foraging activity, distance from refugia and resting time of Pomacentrus trichrourus (pale-tail damselfish). Observations of fish behaviour in natural conditions showed that individuals substantially reduced distance from refugia and feeding rate and increased resting time at sub-optimal environmental temperatures in winter (average SST = 21°C) and summer (average SST = 34°C), while showing high movement and feeding activity in spring (average SST= 27°C). Diet was dominated by plankton in winter and spring, while fish used both plankton and benthic trophic resources in summer. These findings were corroborated under laboratory conditions: in a replicated aquarium experiment, time away from refugia and activity were significantly higher at 28°C (i.e., spring temperature conditions) compared to 21 °C (i.e., winter temperature conditions). Our findings suggest that P. trichrourus may have adapted to the Arabian/Persian Gulf environment by downregulating costly activity during winter and summer and upregulating activity and increasing energy stores in spring. Such adaptive behavioural plasticity may be an important factor in the persistence of populations within increasing environmentally variable coral reef ecosystems.",726,124,335,30.0

Stocker",658914;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/658914,"Humans have the tendency to commit to a single interpretation of what has caused some observed evidence rather than considering all possible alternatives. This tendency can explain various forms of confirmation and reference biases. However, committing to a single high-level interpretation seems short-sighted and irrational, and thus it is unclear why humans seem motivated to pursue such strategy.In a first step toward answering this question, we systematically quantified how this strategy affects estimation accuracy at the feature level in the context of two universal hierarchical inference tasks, categorical perception and causal cue combination. Using model simulations, we demonstrate that although estimation is generally impaired when conditioned on only a single high-level inter-pretation, the impairment is not uniform across the entire feature range. On the contrary, compared to a full inference strategy that considers all high-level interpretations, accuracy is actually better for feature values for which the probability of an incorrect categorical/structural commitment is relatively low. That is to say, if an observer is reasonably certain about the high-level interpretation of the feature, it is advantageous to condition subsequent feature inference only on that particular interpretation. We also show that this benefit of commitment is substantially amplified if late noise corrupts information processing (e.g., during retention in working memory). Our results suggest that top-down inference strategies that solely rely on the most likely high-level interpretation can be favorable and at least locally outperform a full inference strategy.",1494,139,659,27.0

Such metacognitive abilities allow us to adjust ongoing behavior and modify future decisions in the absence of external feedback. Although metacognition is critical in many daily life settings, it remains unclear what information is actually being monitored and what kind of information is being used for metacognitive decisions. In the present study, we investigated whether response information connected to perceptual events contribute to metacognitive decision-making. Therefore, we recorded EEG signals during a perceptual color discrimination task while participants were asked to provide an estimate about the quality of their decision on each trial. Critically, the moment participants provided second-order decisions varied across conditions, thereby changing the amount of action information (e.g., response competition or response fluency) available for metacognitive decisions.Results from three experiments demonstrate that metacognitive performance improved when first-order action information was available at the moment metacognitive decisions about the perceptual task had to be provided. This behavioral effect was accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity (beta phase synchrony) between motor areas and prefrontal regions, exclusively observed during metacognitive decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that action information contributes to metacognitive decision-making, thereby painting a picture of metacognition as a second-order process, integrating sensory evidence and the state of the decider during decision-making.Significance Monitoring and control of our decision process is a critical part of every day decision-making. When feedback is not available, metacognitive skills enable us to modify current behavior and adapt prospective decision-making. Here, we investigated what kind information is being used to compute an estimate about the quality of our decisions. Results demonstrate that during perceptual decision-making, information about one’s actions towards perceptual events is being used to evaluate the quality of one’s decisions. EEG results indicate that functional connectivity between motor regions and prefrontal cortex could serve as a mechanism to convey action information during metacognitive decision-making. Considered together, our results demonstrate that post-decisional information contributes to metacognition, thereby evaluating not only what one perceives (e.g., strength of perceptual evidence) but also how one responds towards perceptual events.",1549,270,491,33.0

Derman, Carrie R. Ferrario",657833;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/657833,"Global obesity rates continue to rise, presenting a major challenge to human health. Efforts to uncover the drivers of this epidemic have highlighted the contribution of Pavlovian motivational processes to overeating. In humans, brain and behavioral reactivity to food related stimuli positively correlates with subsequent weight gain. In concordance with this, selectively bred obesity-prone rats exhibit stronger cue-triggered food-seeking via single outcome Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (SO PIT) than obesity-resistant rats. These data show that Pavlovian motivation is stronger in selectively bred obesity-prone groups. However, whether obesity susceptibility in outbred populations is associated with enhanced PIT is unknown. Moreover, PIT can arise via two neurobehaviorally dissociable processes, a sensory specific versus a general affective process that cannot be distinguished by SO PIT. Thus, it is unclear which PIT process is enhanced in obesity-prone groups. Therefore, we determined whether obesity susceptibility in outbred populations is associated with enhanced Sensory Specific (SS) PIT or General PIT and whether expression of these forms of PIT differs between selectively bred obesity-prone versus obesity-resistant rats. We find that in outbred rats, the magnitude of General PIT is positively correlated with subsequently determined obesity susceptibility. In selectively bred rats, the magnitude of General PIT was stronger in obesity-prone versus obesity-resistant groups. Jointly, these data show that enhanced affective Pavlovian motivation is tightly linked to obesity vulnerability, supporting a role for phenotypic differences in incentive motivation for the development of obesity. This has important implications for obesity prevention and for understanding the neurocircuitry mediating enhanced food-seeking in vulnerable individuals.",841,245,340,15.0

We here described four-, five-, six-, and seven-armed locomotion with the aim to generalize a common rule which is flexible with arm numbers in brittle stars. We mechanically stimulated an arm in Ophiactis brachyaspis to analyze escape direction and arm movements. Gathering quantitative indices and employing Bayesian statistical modeling, we figured out an average locomotion: regardless of the total number of arms, a front position emerges at one of the second neighboring arms to a mechanically stimulated arm, while side arms adjacent to the front synchronously work as left and right rowers. We suggest a model where some afferent signal runs either clockwise or anticlockwise along the nerve ring while linearly counting how many arms it passes.

Pruitt",652677;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/652677,"Division of labor (DOL) is a pattern of work organization where individual group members specialize on different tasks. DOL is argued to have been instrumental for the success of eusocial insects, where it scales positively with group size both within and across species. Here we evaluate whether DOL scales positively with group size in a society of cooperative breeders (social spiders) and whether this pattern is impacted by the behavioral composition of the group. To do this we engineered experimental colonies of contrasting group sizes and behavioral compositions and tracked individuals participation in two colony maintenance tasks: prey capture and web construction. As with some eusocial insects, we found that larger groups exhibited DOL metrics up to 10-times greater than smaller groups, conveying that individuals specialize on particular tasks more in larger colonies. This scalar relationship did not differ by a groups behavioral composition, though groups composed of only bold spiders exhibited reduced DOL relative to all-shy or mixed groups. We also found that per capita participation in prey capture, but not web construction, decreased as a function of group size. This suggests that individuals in larger groups may save energy by reducing their involvement in some tasks. Together, our results convey that similar scalar relationships between DOL and group size can emerge both inside and outside the eusocial insects. Thus, theory developed for understanding DOL in eusocial societies may inform our understanding of group function in a larger swath of animal social diversity than is broadly appreciated.Significance Statement Division of labor (DOL) has been a major area of research in the eusocial insects for decades, and is argues to underlie their ecological success. Only recently have other social arthropods, such as social spiders, been considered for studies concerning DOL. Given their smaller colony sizes, and absence of morphological castes, DOL was not thought to be an important facet of spider societies. However, we found that spider societies do indeed exhibit high degrees of DOL that is positively correlated to colony size, as seen in many eusocial insects. These findings suggest that the scalar relationship between group size and social organization seen in social insects is likely generalizable to a larger diversity of social taxa, and that cooperative breeders can show levels of division of labor equaling or exceeding those of eusocial systems evaluated to date.",961,330,350,25.0

An online survey was performed to explore severity and progression of firework fears in dogs, and relationships with demographics, health, behaviour problems, and owners’ training efforts to prevent or alleviate firework fears. 1225 responses were analysed. Fifty-two percent of dogs were at least partially affected by firework fears, and the great majority developed a fear of fireworks in the first year of life, with a decreasing frequency of new occurrences up until seven years, and only few newly affected dogs beyond this age. While almost three quarters of fearful dogs had recovered by the next morning, recovery took up to one day in 10%, up to one week in 12%, and several weeks or even months in &gt;3%. Univariate analyses indicated a significant effect of breed group, age, sex, neuter status, origin and age at acquisition on severity of firework fears in dogs. However, binomial models including multiple predictors of presence/ absence of firework fears identified only age, breed group (mixed breeds being most affected), health problems, and an interaction between health problems and age as significant predictors. This discrepancy might be explained by collinearities of predictors and underlying differences between mixed-breed dogs and purebreds, such as mixed breeds being acquired from shelters more often, being adopted at higher ages, and being neutered more often. Firework fears are highly correlated with fears of gunshots and thunder, and to a low extent with fears of other noises, but not with any other behavioural problems. Both improvement and deterioration of firework fears were frequently reported. While an early age of onset and breed differences point to a strong genetic contribution to firework fears, training puppies or non-fearful adults to associate the noise with positive stimuli is highly effective in preventing later development of firework fears.",1303,334,320,40.0

However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these effects. Here we focused on changes induced by chronic maternal separation during the first two weeks of postnatal life. Unbiased mRNA expression profiling in the medial PFC (mPFC) of maternally separated (MS) pups identified an increased expression of myelin-related genes and a decreased expression of immediate early genes. Oligodendrocyte lineage markers and birthdating experiments indicated a precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation in the mPFC at P15, leading to a depletion of the oligodendrocyte progenitor pool in MS adults. We tested the role of neuronal activity in oligodendrogenesis, using designed receptors exclusively activated by designed drugs (DREADDs) techniques. hM4Di or hM3Dq constructs were transfected into mPFC neurons using fast-acting AAV8 viruses. Reduction of mPFC neuron excitability during the first two postnatal weeks caused a premature differentiation of oligodendrocytes similar to the MS pups, while chemogenetic activation normalized it in the MS animals. Bidirectional manipulation of neuron excitability in the mPFC during the P2-P14 period had long lasting effects on adult emotional behaviours and on temporal object recognition: hM4Di mimicked MS effects, while hM3Dq prevented the pro-depressive effects and short term memory impairment of MS.

The angular velocity estimation of the model is little affected by the spatial frequency and contrast in synthetic grating experiments. The model is also tested behaviourally in Unity with the tunnel centring and terrain following paradigms. Together with the proposed angular velocity based control algorithms, the virtual bee navigates well in a patterned tunnel and can keep a certain distance from undulating ground with gratings in a series of controlled trials.

We observed no significant sex differences in foraging or anxiety-related behaviors between intact adult male and female mice but found significant differences between adult male and female mice that had been gonadectomized (GDX) prior to puberty. GDX males failed to acquire the odor-guided foraging task, showed reduced locomotion, and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, while GDX females showed the opposite pattern of behavior.

Here, we survey for phenotypic and behavioral differences between a surface population and a cave population of A. mexicanus that has recently colonized Honey Creek Cave, Comal County, Texas, likely within the last century. We found that fish from Honey Creek Cave and fish from Honey Creek surface populations differ significantly in morphological traits including length, coloration, body condition, eye size, and dorsal fin placement. Cavefish also exhibit an increased number of superficial neuromasts relative to surface fish. Behaviorally, cavefish consume fewer worms when trials are performed in both lighted and darkened conditions. Cavefish are more aggressive than surface fish and exhibit fewer behaviors associated with stress. Further in contrast to surface fish, cavefish prefer the edges to the center of an arena and are qualitatively more likely to investigate a novel object placed in the tank. While cavefish and surface fish were wild-caught and developmental environment likely play a role in shaping these differences, our work demonstrates morphological and behavioral shifts for Texas cavefish and offers an exciting opportunity for future work to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to early cave colonization.",1875,204,486,52.0

Previous studies have revealed that stronger fear conditioning training protocols are associated with both increased post-training corticosterone (CORT) levels and fear responses at later retrieval tests. Here we used discriminative contextual fear conditioning (CFC) to investigate the relationship between post-training CORT levels and memory specificity in different retrieval timepoints. Wistar rats were exposed to CFC training with increasing footshock intensities (0.3, 0.6 or 1.0mA) and had their blood collected 30 min afterwards to measure post-training plasma CORT. After 2, 14 or 28 days, rats were tested for memory specificity either in the training or in the novel context. Regression analysis was used to verify linear and non-linear interactions between CORT levels and freezing. Higher footshock intensities increased post-training CORT levels and freezing times during tests in all timepoints. Moreover, stronger trainings elicited faster memory generalization, which was associated with higher CORT levels during memory consolidation. The 0.3mA training maintained memory specificity up to 28 days. Additionally, linear regressions suggest that the shift from specific to generalized memories is underway at 14 days after training. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that stronger training protocols elicit a faster generalization rate, and that this process is associated with increased post-training CORT release.HIGHLIGHTS Stronger contextual fear conditioning (CFC) elicits higher plasma corticosterone (CORT).Strong CFC and high CORT levels increase the rate of memory generalization.Weak CFC and low CORT levels retain memory specificity up to 28 days.Post-training plasma CORT is linearly associated with remote generalized fear.",1336,640,466,26.0

Moths that were enticed with visual cues to an artificial flower emitting an ozonated blend learned to associate this blend with a nectar reward after just one rewarded experience. More importantly, moths that were rewarded while experiencing the unozonated floral blend of their host subsequently found the ozonated floral blend of the same host attractive, most likely due to experience-based reinforcement of ozone-insensitive cues in the blend.The attraction of moths to both unaltered and ozonated plumes is critical for tolerating polluted landscapes. At the host plant, where moths feed, floral emissions are relatively pure. As floral odors travel away from the host, however, they become degraded by pollution. Therefore, targeting the flower requires recognizing both conditions of the odor. The ability to generalize between the pure and ozone-altered scents may enable pollinators like M. sexta to maintain communication with their flowers and reduce the impact anthropogenic oxidants may have on plant-pollinator systems.",856,179,382,18.0

The toxicity of Chinese herbal toothpaste and its crude extracts against red imported fire ant was evaluated in the laboratory bioassay. The results showed that the traditional Chinese medicine toothpaste with watermelon cream has significant toxicity to red imported fire ants. The mortality reached more than 80% after 48h treatment, and the mortality was 100% after 72h treatment. Among the fractions separated from watermelon cream after the extraction of toothpaste, the ethyl acetate fraction has higher activity, and the mortality was more than 80% when the concentration was 1% after 72h. Our results suggest that Chinese herbal toothpaste is toxic to insects and have the potential for bait application in pest control.",664,211,262,27.0

In order to study the anaesthetic drugs per se, and to eliminate the effect of clinical variables, several animal studies have been published. Isoflurane induced transient deficits on spatial memory at low concentrations, affecting the hippocampus. However, the influence of different concentrations of isoflurane on non-spatial memory still needs clarification. Thus, our aim was to study the effects of different depths of anaesthesia (1% and 2% isoflurane) on a non-spatial memory task, the object recognition test, in C57BL/6 adult mice.Twenty-eight 2-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were habituated to the test arena of the object recognition test for 10 min each day over 2 days before anaesthesia. Mice were then randomly allocated in different treatment groups: 1% or 2%, anaesthetized with 1% or 2% of isoflurane, respectively, for 1 h or the control group, which was not anaesthetised. Twenty-four hours after anaesthesia, the animals were placed in an arena with two identical objects and allowed to explore for 10 min-Sample Trial. One hour later, mice were allowed to explore the arena for 10 min in the presence of one of the objects presented in the previous trial (familiar object) and a novel object - Choice Trial. The time spent exploring each object was evaluated by a blinded analysis. The recognition of one object as familiar was detected based on a higher level of exploration of the novel object.Animals that were anaesthetized previously with 2% isoflurane performed at control levels, indicating the recognition of a familiar object in the object recognition task; this contrasted with the results of the group that was anaesthetized with 1% isoflurane.Lighter (1%) rather than deeper (2%) isoflurane anaesthesia may affect non-spatial memory in C57BL/6 male mice. Our results raise awareness of the need for careful consideration of the depth of anaesthesia used, especially the use of light isoflurane anaesthesia, which is often chosen to provide animal immobilization during non-invasive procedures.",734,112,213,15.0

In adults, aversive events can both enhance memory for associated stimuli as well as generalize to enhance memory for unreinforced but conceptually related stimuli. The present study tested whether learned aversive associations similarly lead to better memory and generalization across a category of stimuli in adolescents. Participants completed an olfactory Pavlovian category conditioning task in which trial-unique exemplars from one of two categories were partially reinforced with an aversive odor. Participants then returned 24-hours later to complete a recognition memory test. We found better corrected recognition memory for the reinforced versus the unreinforced category of stimuli in both adults and adolescents. Further analysis revealed that enhanced recognition memory was driven specifically by better memory for the reinforced exemplars. Autonomic arousal during learning was also related to subsequent memory. These findings build on previous work in adolescent and adult humans and rodents showing comparable acquisition of aversive Pavlovian conditioned responses across age groups and demonstrate that memory for stimuli with an acquired aversive association is enhanced in both adults and adolescents.",1840,407,626,32.0

While it is well established that serotonin (5-HT) is a crucial factor in mood, impaired cellular bioenergetics are also implicated. Creatine (Cr), through the Cr/Phospho-Cr (PCr) shuttle, maintains high ATP concentrations in the neuron. This system may be implicated in the etiology of affective disorders, as reduced Cr, PCr, and ATP are often seen in the brains of affected patients. To address this issue, Cr transporter (Crt) deficient male mice (Slc6a8−/y) and female mice heterozygous for Crt expression (Slc6a8+/−) were used to evaluate how a Cr deficient system would alter affective-like behaviors. Slc6a8−/y and Slc6a8+/− mice had more escapes and faster escape latencies in learned helplessness, indicating a potential resilience to behavioral despair. Elevated zero maze and tail-suspension test performance matched that of wildtype mice, however. Slc6a8−/y mice have increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content in the hippocampus and striatum and increased monoamine oxidase protein and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 protein content in the hippocampus, while serotonin levels are unchanged.

This study investigated responses to TT application in horses, at rest, using both behavioural (head-tossing, ear position, gaping and lip licking) and physiological (salivary cortisol concentrations, eye surface temperature and heart rate) indices. Twelve Standardbred horses (six of which were naïve to TT) were used in a randomised crossover design. The study comprised 3 phases; Phase 1 (Baseline), Phase 2 (Treatment), and Phase 3 (Recovery). At phase 2, tongue tie application (TTA) was performed using a rubber band that was looped around the tongue and secured to the mandible for 20 minutes. The control treatment (C) incorporated 30 secs of tongue manipulation, at the start of the 20 min, however no TT was applied. Behaviours (head-tossing, ear position, mouth gaping and lip-licking) and heart rate (HR) were recorded for the duration of the study and analysed in ten minute intervals. Salivary samples were taken at the end of each phase for subsequent cortisol assays and infrared thermography images were taken of each eye at 5-minute intervals. Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS using linear mixed effects models and repeated measures general linear models, to determine differences between treatments and within treatments, over time. Compared to control, there was more head-tossing/shaking (p&lt;0.001), gaping (p&lt;0.001) and backwards ear position (p&lt;0.001) and less forward ear position (p&lt;0.001) during TTA, in Phase 2. Horses with previous experience of TT showed more head-tossing (p=0.040) and gaping (p=0.030) than naïve horses. Lip-licking was more frequent after TTA treatment than control, during Phase 3 (p&lt;0.001). Salivary cortisol concentrations increased after TTA (1846.1pg/mL ± 478.3pg/mL vs 1253.6pg/mL ± 491.6pg/mL, p=0.047). Mean HR, and mean right and left eye temperature did not differ significantly between treatments in any phase (all p&gt; 0.05).

Here, via extensive behavioral testing and quantitative modeling, we show that rats exhibit similar time preferences in both contexts: they prefer immediate vs. delayed rewards and they are sensitive to opportunity costs — delays to future decisions. Further, a quasi-hyperbolic discounting model, a form of hyperbolic discounting with separate components for short-and long-term rewards, explains individual rats’ time preferences across both contexts, providing evidence for a common mechanism for myopic behavior in foraging and intertemporal choice.",1857,412,662,27.0

In animal experiments, this is typically achieved by using sparsely distributed (embedded) sensors that detect animal presence in select regions of interest. High-speed cameras provide high-density sampling across large arenas, capturing the richness of animal behavior, however, the image processing bottleneck prohibits real-time feedback in the context of rapidly evolving behaviors.Approach Here we developed an open-source software, named PolyTouch, to track animal behavior in large arenas and provide rapid close-loop feedback in ~5.7 ms, ie. average latency from the detection of an event to analog stimulus delivery, e.g. auditory tone, TTL pulse, when tracking a single body. This stand-alone software is written in JAVA. The included wrapper for MATLAB provides experimental flexibility for data acquisition, analysis and visualization.Main results As a proof-of-principle application we deployed the PolyTouch for place awareness training. A user-defined portion of the arena was used as a virtual target; visit (or approach) to the target triggered auditory feedback. We show that mice develop awareness to virtual spaces, tend to stay shorter and move faster when they reside in the virtual target zone if their visits are coupled to relatively high stimulus intensity (≥49dB). Thus, close-loop presentation of perceived aversive feedback is sufficient to condition mice to avoid virtual targets within the span of a single session (~20min).Significance Neuromodulation techniques now allow control of neural activity in a cell-type specific manner in spiking resolution. Using animal behavior to drive closed-loop control of neural activity would help to address the neural basis of behavioral state and environmental context-dependent information processing in the brain.",2017,489,719,34.0

We approach this problem using a collective search paradigm where interactions are dynamic and there is competition for rewards. Using evolutionary simulations, we find that the unconditional sharing of information can be an evolutionary advantageous strategy without the need for conditional strategies or explicit reciprocation. Shared information acts as a recruitment signal and facilitates the formation of a self-organized group. Thus, the improved search efficiency of the collective bestows byproduct benefits onto the original sharer. A key mechanism is a visibility radius, where individuals have unconditional access to information about neighbors within a limited distance. Our results show that for a variety of initial conditions—including populations initially devoid of prosocial individuals—and across both static and dynamic fitness landscapes, we find strong selection pressure to evolve unconditional sharing.",1599,876,519,7.0

In this study, we analyzed whether individual locomotor behavior is stable over development and whether behavioral parameters correlate with physiological and morphological features of the larvae, with the aim to better understand variability and predictability of larval locomotor behavior. We found that locomotor activity of individuals is consistent within the same day and becomes predictable during development especially during dark phases, when larvae are performing exploratory light-searching behavior and display increased activity. Stimulus induced startle responses were less predictable for an individual, and response strength did not correlate with inherent locomotor activity. Moreover, locomotor activity was not associated with physiological and morphological features of the larva (resting heart rate, body length, size of the swim bladder).

A questionnaire study was launched to investigate the external validity of owner-derived estimates of dominance in dog dyads sharing the same household (N = 1151). According to the owners, dogs rated as dominant (87%) have priority access to resources (resting place, food, and rewards), undertake certain tasks (defend and lead the group, bark more), display dominance (win fights, lick the other’s mouth less, and mark over the other’s urine), share certain personality traits (smarter, more aggressive and impulsive), and are older than their partner dog (all p &lt; 0.0001).

Results suggest that owner-derived reports of dominance ranks of dogs living in multi-dog households correspond to ethologically valid behavioural markers of dominance. Size and physical condition were unrelated to the perceived dominance. Surprisingly, in mixed-sex dyads, females were more frequently rated as dominant than males, which might correspond to a higher proportion of neutered females in this subgroup.

Nevertheless, there is no experimental evidence that relate pristane-induced lupus with cognitive dysfunction associated with autoantibodies production.Objective To evaluate cognitive impairment related to memory deficits in a pristane-induced lupus BALB/c female mice related to mRNA expression levels of NR2A/2B hippocampal subunits in short and long-term memory task at 7 and 12 weeks after LPS exposition (7wLPS and 12wLPS) in a behavioral test with the employment of Barnes maze.Methods Fifty-four female BALB/c mice of 8-12 weeks old were included in 2 experimental groups: 7 and 12 weeks after lypopolissacharide (LPS) exposure and classified in subgroups (control, pristane and pristane+LPS). To determine cognitive dysfunction, mice were tested in a Barnes maze.

Langergraber",631887;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/631887,"Although paternal investment explains the evolution of fatherhood from a functional perspective, its evolutionary origins are unclear. Here we investigate whether a building block for paternal investment, father-offspring discrimination, is present in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. Adolescent and young adult males (12 - 21 years old) maintained proximity and groomed with their fathers more frequently than with other males given how often they associated. This discrimination did not likely increase the short-term inclusive fitness of fathers or sons because the absolute time they spent in proximity or grooming did not exceed the time spent in these activities by other dyads. Almost all grooming was done by sons rather than fathers, suggesting that sons are responsible for observed biases in father-son behavior. Father-offspring discrimination could partly be explained by young males socializing with males who were more likely to be their father based on their age at the time of the young male’s conception. Two other cues of paternity, the other male’s rank at the time of the young male’s infancy and the other male’s association frequency with the young male’s mother during the young male’s infancy/juvenility, failed to predict association-controlled proximity or grooming. Father-son biases persisted even after controlling for characteristics of males that predicted paternity probability, implicating other cues that we did not examine. These results suggest that an important factor for the evolution of highly investing fathers in humans, father-offspring discrimination, may have been present in simpler form in the last common ancestor they shared with chimpanzees.",968,333,406,28.0

Thus, we aimed to investigate the existence and incidence of natural left-right bias of adult zebrafish in the Y-maze test and explore any relationship of biasedness on the performance of different behavioral domains. This included learning about threat-cues in the fear conditioning test and locomotion and anxiety-related behavior in the novel tank diving test. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that zebrafish exhibit a natural manifestation of motor behavioral lateralization which can influence aversive learning responses. Although laterality did not change locomotion or anxiety-related behaviors, we found that biased animals had an altered exploration pattern in the Y-maze, making them easily discernable from their unbiased counterparts, and increased learning associated to fear cues.",1141,807,683,25.0

Chronic stress-based animal models have provided critical insight into the understanding of these responses. Currently available assays measuring chronic stress-induced behavioral states in mice are limited in their design (short, not repeatable, sensitive to experimenter-bias) and often inconsistent. Using the Noldus PhenoTyper apparatus, we identified a new readout that repeatedly assesses behavioral changes induced by chronic stress in two mouse models i.e. chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (UCMS). The PhenoTyper test consists of overnight monitoring of animals’ behavior in home-cage setting before, during and after a 1hr light challenge applied over a designated food zone. We tested the reproducibility and reliability of the PhenoTyper test in assessing the effects of chronic stress exposure, and compared outcomes with commonly-used tests. While chronic stress induced heterogeneous profiles in classical tests, CRS- and UCMS-exposed mice showed a very consistent response in the PhenoTyper test. Indeed, CRS and UCMS mice continue avoiding the lit zone in favor of the shelter zone. This “residual avoidance” after the light challenge, lasted for hours beyond termination of the challenge, was not observed after acute stress and was consistently found throughout stress exposure in both models. Chronic stress-induced residual avoidance was alleviated by chronic imipramine treatment but not acute diazepam administration. This behavioral index should be instrumental for studies aiming to better understand the trajectory of chronic stress-induced deficits and potentially screen novel anxiolytics and antidepressants.",2317,464,2272,46.0

Morphological changes in periodontal tissue and root of the experimental dentine were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the osteoclast number and expression changes in IL-17, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the periodontal tissues, respectively, on the pressure side of the experimental tooth.Results IL-17 was detected in GCF and serum. The pressure area exhibited alveolar bone resorption only at a force of 20g. Additionally, a force of 60g led to root resorption. IL-17, RANKL/OPG and osteoclast number showed similar trend that all expressed increasing high level at early stage, then significantly decreased from days 5 to 14, and revealed 60g group the highest expression level while 0g group the lowest.The change in the IL-17 level in the GCF was strongly correlated with IL-17 and RANKL/OPG expression levels and osteoclast numbers in the periodontal ligament.Conclusions The results indicated that measuring IL-17 level in GCF can predict the risk of alveolar bone and root resorption induced by orthodontic treatment.",690,205,235,25.0

An important aspect of this relates to the timing of activities. For example, many studies on migratory birds have shown that relatively late spring arrival in the breeding area reduces both the likelihood of getting a mate or territory and reproductive success.In contrast, relatively little is known about movements of individuals in non-migratory populations during the non-breeding season. Few studies have investigated the timing of arrival at the breeding area in such species, possibly due to the assumption that most individuals remain in the area during the non-breeding season.In this study, we used four years of data from a transponder-based automated recording system set up in a non-migratory population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) to describe individual variation in arrival at the breeding site. We investigated whether this variation can be explained by individual characteristics (sex, body size, or status), and we assessed its effect on aspects of reproductive success in the subsequent breeding season.We found substantial variation in arrival date and demonstrate that this trait is individual-specific (repeatable). Females arrived later than males, but the arrival dates of social pair members were more similar than expected by chance. Arrival predicted both whether an individual would end up breeding that season, and several aspects of its breeding success.Our study suggests that non-migratory species show a form of incipient migration behaviour in that they leave the breeding area during the non-breeding season. We conclude that the timing of pre-breeding events, in particular arrival date, may be an overlooked, but important, fitness-relevant trait in non-migratory species.",842,411,287,36.0

In the Americas, FAW migrates from winter-breeding areas in the south into summer-breeding areas throughout North America where it is a major pest of corn. Asian populations are also likely to evolve migrations into the corn-producing regions of eastern China, where they will pose a serious threat to food security.RESULTS To evaluate the invasion risk in eastern China, the rate of expansion and future migratory range was modelled by a trajectory simulation approach, combined with flight behaviour and meteorological data. Our results predict that FAW will migrate from its new year-round breeding regions into the two main corn-producing regions of eastern China (the North China and Northeast China Plains), via two pathways. The western pathway originates in Myanmar and Yunnan, and FAW will take four migration steps to reach the North China Plain by July. Migration along the eastern pathway from Indochina and southern China progresses faster, with FAW reaching the North China Plain in three steps by June and reaching the Northeast China Plain in July.CONCLUSION Our results indicate that there is a high risk that FAW will invade the major corn-producing areas of eastern China via two migration pathways, and cause significant impacts to agricultural productivity. Information on migration pathways and timings can be used to inform integrated pest management strategies for this emerging pest.",2138,998,1565,39.0

Coil",625079;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/625079,"Anal sacs are an important odor producing organ found across the mammalian Order Carnivora. Secretions from the anal sac may be used as chemical signals by animals for behaviors ranging from defense to species recognition to signaling reproductive status. In addition, a recent study suggests that domestic cats utilize short-chain free fatty acids in anal sac secretions for individual recognition. The fermentation hypothesis is the idea that symbiotic microorganisms living in association with animals contribute to odor profiles used in chemical communication and that variation in these chemical signals reflects variation in the microbial community. Here we examine the fermentation hypothesis by characterizing volatile organic compounds (VOC) and bacteria isolated from anal sac secretions collected from a male bengal cat, a cross between a domestic cat and wild leopard cat (Felis catus × Prionailurus bengalensis).Both left and right anal sacs of a male bengal cat were manually expressed (emptied) and collected. Half of the material was used to culture bacteria or to extract bacterial DNA and other half was used for VOC analysis. DNA was extracted from the anal sac secretions and used for a 16S rRNA gene sequence based characterization of the microbial community. Additionally, some of the material was plated out in order to isolate bacterial colonies. The same three taxa, Bacteroides fragilis, Tessaracoccus, and Finegoldia magna were abundant in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data and also isolated by culturing. Using Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we tentatively identified 52 compounds from bengal cat anal sac secretions and 67 compounds from cultures of the three bacterial isolates chosen for further analysis.. Among 67 compounds tentatively identified from bacteria isolates, 52 were also found in the anal sac secretion.We show that the bacterial community in the anal sac consists primarily of only a few abundant taxa and that isolates of these taxa produce numerous volatiles that are found in the combined anal sac volatile profile. Many of these volatiles are found in anal sac secretions from other carnivorans, and are also associated with known bacterial biosynthesis pathways. This supports the fermentation hypothesis and the idea that the anal sac is maintained at least in part to house bacteria that produce volatiles for the host.",1499,168,509,28.0

Although early predispositions are connected to physiological development, little is known on the temporal course of early predispositions (whether they are stable or change in time) and on their genetic basis. To address these issues, we tested the preference for objects that change in speed vs. linear motion in three chicken breeds (Padovana, Polverara and Robusta maculata) within one day after hatching and three days after hatching. We found that the predisposition to preferentially attend to changes in speed is fixed at the species level on the first day of life and that it disappears by day three.

While a number of studies have independently investigated motivational or performance aspects of social behaviours, few have examined how these aspects relate to each other. By comparing behavioural variation in response to live or video presentations of conspecific females, we analysed how variation in the motivation to produce courtship song covaries with variation in performance aspects of courtship song in male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Consistent with previous reports, we observed that male zebra finches were less motivated to produce courtship songs to videos of females than to live presentations of females. However, we found that acoustic features that reflect song performance were indistinguishable between songs produced to videos of females and songs produced to live presentations of females. For example, songs directed at video presentations of females were just as fast and stereotyped as songs directed at live females. These experimental manipulations and correlational analyses reveal a dissociation between motivational and performance aspects of birdsong and suggest a refinement of neural models of song production and control. In addition, they support the efficacy of videos to study both motivational and performance aspects of social behaviours.",679,107,304,34.0

Czaczkes",620054;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/620054,"Animals must often decide between exploiting safe options or risky options with a chance for large gains. While traditional optimal foraging theories assume rational energy maximisation, they fail to fully describe animal behaviour. A logarithmic rather than linear perception of stimuli may shape preference, causing animals to make suboptimal choices. Budget-based rules have also been used to explain risk-preference, and the relative importance of these theories is debated. Eusocial insects represent a special case of risk sensitivity, as they must often make collective decisions based on resource evaluations from many individuals. Previously, colonies of the ant Lasius niger were found to be risk-neutral, but the risk preference of individual foragers was unknown. Here, we tested individual L. niger in a risk sensitivity paradigm. Ants were trained to associate a scent with 0.55M sucrose solution and another scent with an equal chance of either 0.1 and 1.0M sucrose. Preference was tested in a Y-maze. Ants were extremely risk averse, with 91% choosing the safe option. Even when the risky option offered on average more sucrose (0.8M) than the fixed option, 75% preferred the latter. Based on the psychophysical Weber-Fechner law, we predicted that logarithmically balanced alternatives (0.3M vs 0.1M/0.9M) would be perceived as having equal value. Our prediction was supported, with ants having no preference for either feeder (53% chose the fixed option). Our results thus strongly support perceptual mechanisms driving risk-aversion in ants, and demonstrate that the behaviour of individual foragers can be a very poor predictor of colony-level behaviour.",1012,155,339,28.0

Here, we studied the chemical perception of aversive compounds of different gustatory modalities (salty and bitter) in the haematophagous kissing bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Over a walking arena, insects preferred a substrate embedded with 0.3 M NaCl or KCl rather than with distilled water. Same salts were avoided when prepared at 1 M. When NaCl and KCl were confronted, no preferences were evinced by insects. A pre-exposure to amiloride interfered with the repellency of NaCl and KCl equally, suggesting that amiloride-sensitive receptors are involved in the detection of both salts. Discriminative experiments were then performed to determine if R. prolixus can distinguish between these salts. An aversive operant conditioning involving either NaCl or KCl modulated the repellency of the conditioned salt, but also of the novel salt. A chemical pre-exposure to the salts did not to modify their repellency levels. When we crossed gustatory modalities by confronting NaCl to caffeine (i.e. a bitter stimulus) no innate preferences were evinced. Aversive operant conditionings with either NaCl or Caf rendered unspecific changes in the repellency of both compounds. A chemical pre-exposure to Caf modulated the response to Caf but not to NaCl, suggesting the existence of two independent neural pathways for the detection of salts and bitter compounds. Overall results suggest that R. prolixus cannot distinguish between NaCl and KCl but can distinguish between NaCl and Caf and generalizes the response between these two aversive stimuli of different gustatory modality.Summary statement Kissing-bugs use contact chemo-perception to avoid aversive substrates.

Learning, behaviour, and memory formation, what used to only be associated with animals with neural systems, have been observed in many unicellular aneural species, namely Physarum, Paramecium, and Stentor (Tang &amp; Marshall 2018). As these are fully functioning organisms, yet being unicellular, there is a much better chance to elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying these learning processes in these organisms without the complications of highly interconnected neural circuits. An intriguing learning behaviour observed in Stentor roeselii (Jennings 1902) when stimulated with carmine has left scientists puzzled for more than a century. So far, none of the existing learning paradigm can fully encapsulate this particular series of five characteristic avoidant reactions. Although we were able to observe all responses described in literature and in a previous study (Dexter et al. 2019, manuscript in preparation), they do not conform to any particular learning model. We then investigated whether models based on machine learning approaches, including decision tree, random forest, and feed-forward neural networks could infer and predict the behavior of S. roeselii. Our results showed that an artificial neural network with multiple ‘computational’ neurons is inefficient at modelling the single-celled ciliate’s avoidant reactions.

Yet, the mechanisms that allow these insects to maintain their stability when carrying heavy loads have been poorly investigated. Here we present a study of the kinematics of loaded locomotion in the polymorphic seed-harvesting ant Messor barbarus. In this species big ants have larger heads relative to their size than small ants. Hence, their center of mass is shifted forward, and the more so when they are carrying a load in their mandibles. We tested the hypothesis that this could lead to big ants being less statically stable than small ants, thus explaining their lower load carriage performances. When walking unloaded we found that big ants were indeed less statically stable than small ants but that they were nonetheless able to adjust their stepping pattern to partly compensate for this instability. When ants were walking loaded on the other hand, there was no evidence of different locomotor behaviors in individuals of different sizes. Loaded ants, whatever their size, move too slowly to maintain their balance through dynamic stability. Rather, they seem to do so by clinging to the ground with their hind legs during part of a stride. We show through a straightforward model that allometric relationships have a minor role in explaining the differences in load carriage performances between big ants and small ants and that a simple scale effect is sufficient to explain these differences.",1000,192,296,30.0

Specifically, there is a general assumption that domesticated species express reduced fear and reactivity towards novel stimuli compared to their ancestral species. However, very few studies have explicitly tested this proposed link between domestication and reduced fear responses. Of the limited number of studies experimentally addressing the alterations of fear during domestication, the majority have been done on canids. Previous work in foxes, wolves and dogs has led to the suggestion that decreased expression of fear in domesticated animals is linked to a domestication driven delay in the first onset of fearful behaviour during early ontogeny. Thus, wolves are expected to express exaggerated fearfulness earlier during ontogeny compared to dogs. However, while adult dogs are less fearful towards novelty than adult wolves and wolf-dog hybrids, consensus is lacking on when differences in fear expression arise in wolves and dogs. Here we present the first extended examination of fear development in hand-raised dogs and European grey wolves, using repeated novel object tests from six to 26 weeks of age. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence in support of an increase in fearfulness in wolves with age or a delayed onset of fear response in dogs compared to wolves. Instead, we found that dogs strongly reduced their fear response in the period between six and 26 weeks of age, resulting in a significant species difference in fear expression towards novelty at 26 weeks. Critically, as wolves did not differ in their fear response towards novelty over time, the detected species difference was caused solely by a progressive reduced fear response in dogs. Our results thereby suggest that species differences in fear of novelty between wolves and dogs are not caused by a domestication driven shift in the first onset of fear response. Instead, we suggest that a loss of sensitivity towards novelty with age in dogs causes the difference in fear expression towards novelty in wolves and dogs.",2719,679,827,21.0

Fundamental to the reliability of this process is the use of a neural compass based on external celestial cues. Here we examine how such compass information could be reliably computed by the insect brain, given realistic constraints on the sky polarisation pattern and the insect eye sensor array. By processing the degree of polarisation in different directions for different parts of the sky, our model can directly estimate the solar azimuth and also infer the confidence of the estimate. We introduce a method to correct for tilting of the sensor array, as might be caused by travel over uneven terrain. We also show that the confidence can be used to approximate the change in sun position over time, allowing the compass to remain fixed with respect to ‘true north’ during long excursions. We demonstrate that the compass is robust to disturbances and can be effectively used as input to an existing neural model of insect path integration. We discuss the plausibility of our model to be mapped to known neural circuits, and to be implemented for robot navigation.Author summary We propose a new hypothesis for how insects process polarised skylight to extract global orientation information that can be used for accurate path integration. Our model solves the problem of solar-antisolar meridian ambiguity by using a biologically constrained sensor array, and includes methods to deal with tilt and time, providing a complete insect celestial compass output.

Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using data from 19 published research articles that use this approach from which 440 effect sizes were extracted. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that pharmacological manipulations overall altered judgement bias as predicted. However, there were several moderating factors including the neurobiological target of the drug, whether the drug was hypothesised to induce a relatively positive or negative affective state, dosage, and the presented cue. This may partially reflect interference from adverse effects of the drug, such as sedation. Thus, while judgement bias can be used to measure pharmacologically-induced affective states, potential adverse effects of the drug should be considered when interpreting results.",1495,132,412,45.0

DeWind,609347;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/609347,"SummaryHumans and many non-human animals have the “number sense,” an ability to estimate the number of items in a set without counting. This innate sense of number is hypothesized to provide a foundation for more complex numerical and mathematical concepts. Here I investigated whether we also share the number sense with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) trained for object recognition. These in silico networks have revolutionized machine learning over the last seven years, allowing computers to reach human-level performance on object recognition tasks for the first time. Their architecture is based on the structure of mammalian visual cortex, and after they are trained, they provide a highly predictive model of responses in primate visual cortex, suggesting deep homologies. I found that the DCNN demonstrates three key hallmarks of the number sense: numerosity-selective units (analogous to biological neurons), the behavioral ratio effect, and ordinality over representational space. Because the DCNN was not trained to enumerate, I conclude that the number sense is an emergent property of the network, the result of some combination of the network architecture and the constraint to develop the complex representational structure necessary for object recognition. By analogy I conclude that the number sense in animals was not necessarily the result of direct selective pressure to enumerate but might have “come for free” with the evolution of a complex visual system that evolved to identify objects and scenes in the real world.",2341,646,1054,31.0

Here we report two experiments which examined: 1) how different components of empathy (cognitive &amp; affective) relate to the habitual use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions (N=220), and 2) how these components of empathy relate to implicit reappraisal in a context-framing task (N=92). In study 1, a positive correlation between cognitive empathy and reappraisal use was observed. Affective empathy showed no relationship with reappraisal use. In study 2, participants completed an implicit reappraisal task in which previously viewed negative images were paired with either a neutralising (intended to reduce negative emotionality) or descriptive (which simply described the image) framing sentence. Participants then reported how unpleasant/pleasant each image made them feel. In contrast to study 1, a positive correlation between affective empathy and the implicit reappraisal task metric (rating of neutralising–descriptive framing conditions) was observed. There was no relationship between cognitive empathy and implicit reappraisal. These findings suggest that both components of empathy are related to reappraisal, but in different ways: Cognitive empathy is related to more deliberate use of reappraisal, while affective empathy is associated with more implicit reappraisal processes.",1147,215,721,33.0

The Indian grey wolf, among the less studied subspecies, is a social carnivore that lives in groups called packs and has many types of vocal communication. In this study, we characterise harmonic vocalisation types in the Indian wolf using howl survey responses and opportunistic recordings from captive and nine packs (each pack contains 2-9 individuals) of free-ranging Indian wolves. Using principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and discriminant function analysis, we found four vocal types using 270 recorded vocalisations (Average Silhouette width Si = 0.598) which include howls and howl-bark (N=238), whimper (N=2), social squeak (N=28), and whine (N=2). Although having a smaller body size, Indian wolf howls have an average mean fundamental frequency of 0.422KHz (±0.126), which is similar to other Holarctic clade subspecies. The whimper showed the highest frequency modulation (37.296±4.601 KHz) and the highest mean fundamental frequency (1.708±0.524 KHz) compared to other call types. Less information is available on the third vocalisation type, i.e. ‘Social squeak’ or ‘talking’ (Mean fundamental frequency =0.461±0.083 KHz), which is highly variable (coefficient of frequency variation = 18.778±3.587 KHz).

Anhedonia is a major symptom of numerous psychiatric disorders and is a diagnostic criterion for depression. It has recently been appreciated that reinforcement may be separated into consummatory (hedonic), motivational and decisional components, all of which may be affected differently in disease. Although anhedonia is typically assessed using positive reinforcement, the importance of stress in psychopathology suggests the study of negative reinforcement (removal or avoidance of aversive events) may be equally important. The present study investigated positive and negative reinforcement following a rat model of mild TBI (mTBI) using lateral fluid percussion. Hedonic value and motivation for reinforcement was determined by behavioral economic analyses. Following mTBI, the hedonic value of avoiding foot shock was reduced. In contrast, the hedonic value of escaping foot shock or obtaining a sucrose pellet was not altered by mTBI. Moreover, motivation to avoid or escape foot shock or to acquire sucrose was not altered by mTBI. Our results suggest that individuals experiencing mTBI find avoidance of aversive events less reinforcing, and therefore are less apt to utilize proactive control of stress.",1014,363,526,45.0

We carried out a causal test of this hypothesis in two experiments (between-subject N=88; within-subject N=50) that used the inhalation of hypercapnic gas (7.5% CO2) to induce an acute state of anxiety in healthy volunteers.

The type of sound people set as their alarm for waking has been shown to reduce the effects of sleep inertia, however, the elemental musical factors that underpin these waking sounds and their relationship remain unclear. The goal of this research is to understand how a particular sound or music chosen to assist waking may counteract sleep inertia, and more specifically, what elements of these sounds may contribute to its reduction using a mix methods analysis. Through an anonymous, self-report online questionnaire, fifty participants (N = 50) reported attributes of their preferred waking sound, their feeling towards the waking sound, and symptoms of sleep inertia after waking. This data enabled the analysis and comparison between these responses to define statistically significant interactions. Our results show that there is no significant relationship between sleep inertia and the reported waking sound, nor the subject’s feeling towards this sound. However, we found that the melodicity of a chosen waking sound does effect sleep inertia. A sound that is perceived as melodic, produces less sleep inertia in comparison to a sound considered to be neutral (neither unmelodic nor melodic). Furthermore, a secondary analysis reveals that this is an important factor for waking stimulus design as it suggests that the amount of perceived rhythm will affect the perception of melody, and in turn, may influence the severity of sleep inertia on a secondary level. Our results reveal that the inclusion of detailed descriptive terms (musical elements) in addition to macro classifications (e.g. “pop music”) for stimulus testing would benefit future research and our understanding of waking audio’s effects on sleep inertia.",1359,183,1227,28.0

However, the mechanisms accounting for this susceptibility remain unclear. Animal models have proved to be useful tools for understanding the role of emotional functioning in the development and maintenance of metabolic alterations implicated in obesity. Here we sought to determine the predictive value of behavioral indices of anxiety for hormonal and metabolic imbalances in rats. Adult Lewis rats were screened on the elevated plus maze (EPM). K-means clustering was used to divide the rats into two groups based on their anxiety index in the EPM: low (LA) and high anxiety (HA) rats. This proxy of anxiety combines individual EPM parameters and accepted ratios into a single score. Four weeks later, we measured markers of endocrine and metabolic function. We found that relative LA rats, the HA rats exhibited reduced latencies to exit a modified light-dark conflict test. Our results show that the HA rats displayed increased corticosterone levels when compared to LA rats. Furthermore, the HA rats weighted more and exhibited an enhanced glycemic response to exogenously administered glucose during the glucose tolerance test, indicating glucose intolerance. Notably, when compared to LA rats, the HA rats showed higher circulating levels of the endogenous cannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG).

Previous comparative studies of mammalian social organisation produced inconsistent results, possibly because they ignored intra-specific variation in social organisation (IVSO). The Artiodactyla have been the focus of many comparative studies as they occupy a wide diversity of habitats and exhibit large variation in life history patterns as well as other potential correlates of social organisation. Here we present the first systematic data on IVSO among Artiodactyla, infer their ancestral social organisation, and test whether habitat, sexual dimorphism, seasonal breeding, and body size predict inter- and intraspecific variation in social organisation. We found data on social organisation for 110 of 226 artiodactyl species, of which 74.5% showed IVSO. Using Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models, the ancestral artiodactyl population was predicted to have a variable social organisation with significantly higher probability (0.77, 95% CI 0.29-1.00) than any non-variable form (i.e. solitary, pair-living, group-living). Greater sexual dimorphism and smaller body size both predicted more IVSO; smaller body size also predicted a higher likelihood of pair-living.

Experimental studies show that different subsets of place cells are controlled by vision, self-motion or a combination of both.

The computational nature of such a bidirectional interaction remains unclear. In this work we present a neural network model of a dynamic loop between place cells and grid cells. The model is tested in two recent experimental paradigms involving double-room environments that provide conflicting evidence about visual cue control over self-motion-based spatial codes. Analysis of the model behavior in the two experiments suggests that the strength of hippocampal-entorhinal dynamical loop is the key parameter governing differential cue control in multi-compartment environments. Construction of spatial representations in visually identical environments requires weak visual cue control, while synaptic plasticity is regulated by the mismatch between visual- and self-motion representations.

Moreover, we cloned and analyzed the expression of genes encoding enzymes, 11β-hydroxylase (11β-h) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-hsd), involved in the production of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT). The results showed that, compared with other fish species, M. albus dmrt1 5′ upstream region contained unique androgen response elements (AREs) with one on the sense strand and the other one on the antisense strand, indicating a crucial role for androgens in the transcriptional regulation of dmrt1. The expression of dmrt1a was induced but the expression of foxl2 was inhibited by T manipulation in vitro, suggesting that blood androgen could activate the transcription of dmrt1 in the ovotestis. Moreover, the expression levels of 11β-h and 11β-hsd2 were predominantly expressed in testis, much less in ovotestis, and barely in ovary, suggesting the production of 11-KT during sex reversal. Androgens are synthesized in large amounts during sex reversal, leading to the promotion of dmrt1 transcription, and thus, gonadal somatic cells transdifferetiation.

Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (PPI) is a behavioral paradigm used extensively for this purpose, but the results of PPI studies are often inconsistent. As a result, the utility of this metric remains uncertain. Here we deconstruct the phenomenon of PPI. We first confirm several limitations of the traditional PPI metric, including that the underlying startle response has a non-Gaussian distribution and that the traditional PPI metric changes with different stimulus condition. We then develop a novel model that reveals PPI to be a combination of the previously appreciated scaling of the startle response, as well as a scaling of sound perception. Using our model, we find no evidence for differences in PPI in a rat model of Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) compared to wild-type controls. These results in the rat provide a reliable methodology that could be used to clarify inconsistent PPI results in mice and humans. In addition, we find robust differences between wild-type male and female rats. Our model allows us to understand the nature of these differences, and we find that both the startle-scaling and sound-scaling components of PPI are a function of the baseline startle response. Males and females differ specifically in the startle-scaling, but not the sound-scaling, component of PPI.

We define a measure of colour vividness, such that points on the surface are maximally vivid and the ‘grey’ centre is minimally vivid. We show that a vivid colour for one animal is likely to vivid for others, and highly vivid colours are less easily mimicked than less vivid colours. Further, vivid colours such as black, white, red, blue and light, unsaturated shades are produced pure or orderly materials. This kind of material needs to created and maintained against entropic processes that would otherwise degrade or destroy them.

1348,Ensemble modeling of auditory streaming reveals potential sources of bistability across the perceptual hierarchy,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/598631v1,"David F. Little, Joel S. Snyder, Mounya Elhilali",598631;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/598631,"Perceptual bistability—the spontaneous fluctuation of perception between two interpretations of a stimulus—occurs when observing a large variety of ambiguous stimulus configurations. This phenomenon has the potential to serve as a tool for, among other things, understanding how function varies across individuals due to the large individual differences that manifest during perceptual bistability. Yet it remains difficult to interpret the functional processes at work, without knowing where bistability arises during perception. In this study we explore the hypothesis that bistability originates from multiple sources distributed across the perceptual hierarchy. We develop a hierarchical model of auditory processing comprised of three distinct levels: a Peripheral, tonotopic analysis, a Central analysis computing features found more centrally in the auditory system, and an Object analysis, where sounds are segmented into different streams. We model bistable perception within this system by injecting adaptation, inhibition and noise into one or all of the three levels of the hierarchy. We evaluate a large ensemble of variations of this hierarchical model, where each model has a different configuration of adaptation, inhibition and noise. This approach avoids the assumption that a single configuration must be invoked to explain the data. Each model is evaluated based on its ability to replicate two hallmarks of bistability during auditory streaming: the selectivity of bistability to specific stimulus configurations, and the characteristic log-normal pattern of perceptual switches. Consistent with a distributed origin, a broad range of model parameters across this hierarchy lead to a plausible form of perceptual bistability. The ensemble also appears to predict that greater individual variation in adaptation and inhibition occurs in later stages of perceptual processing.Author summary Our ability to experience the everyday world through our senses requires that we resolve numerous ambiguities present in the physical evidence available. This is accomplished, in part, through a series of hierarchical computations, in which stimulus interpretations grow increasingly . Our ability to resolve ambiguity does not always succeed, such as during optical illusions. In this study, we examine a form of perceptual ambiguity called bistability—cases in which a single individual’s perception spontaneously switches back and forth between two interpretations of a single stimulus. A challenge in understanding bistability is that we don’t know where along the perceptual hierarchy it is generated. Here we test the idea that there are multiple origins by building a simulation of the auditory system. Consistent with a multi-source account of bistability, this simulation accurately predicts perception of a simple auditory stimulus when bistability originates from a number of different sources within the model. The data also indicate that individual differences during ambiguous perception may primarily originate from higher levels of the perceptual hierarchy. This result provides a clue for future work aiming to determine how auditory function differs across individual brains.",898,118,314,28.0

We consider that Local Field Potential (LFP) oscillation cycles specify a sequence of states, represented as neuronal ensembles. Repeated presentation of time intervals during training reinforces the connections of specific ensembles to downstream networks. Later, during the peak-interval procedure, these downstream networks are reactivated by previously experienced neuronal ensembles, triggering actions at the learned time intervals.

In this study, we investigated how reliable this welfare indicator is at detecting acute stress by testing the reaction of macaques to the stressful event of being exposed to an agonistic interaction between conspecifics housed in the same room but in a different cage. Pacing, agitated locomotion, and stress-related displacement behaviours were quantified before, during and after agonistic interaction exposure, based on video recordings of 13 socially-housed macaques in their home cage. Displacement behaviours increased after agonistic interaction exposure, confirming that the events were experienced as stressful by the focal individuals. The occurrence of pacing did not increase during or after the agonistic interactions. Instead, agitated locomotion increased during the agonistic interactions. These results suggest either, that pacing as an indicator of acute stress is prone to false negative results, increasing in some stressful situations but not others, or that agitated locomotion has been mistaken for pacing in previous studies and that pacing is in fact unrelated to current acute stress. Both interpretations lead to the conclusion that pacing is unreliable as an indicator of acute stress in laboratory rhesus macaques.",927,228,332,19.0

This requires us to gather and parse complex, sometimes conflicting, information. Yet, the brain is capable of translating sensory stimuli from disparate modalities into a cohesive and accurate percept with little conscious effort. Previous studies of multisensory integration have suggested that the brain’s integration of cues is well-approximated by an ideal observer implementing Bayesian causal inference. However, behavioral data from tasks that include only one stimulus in each modality fail to capture what is in nature a complex process. Here we employed an auditory spatial discrimination task in which listeners were asked to determine on which side they heard one of two concurrently presented sounds. We compared two visual conditions in which task-uninformative shapes were presented in the center of the screen, or spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli. We found that performance on the auditory task improved when the visual stimuli were spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli—even though the shapes provided no information about which side the auditory target was on. We also demonstrate that a model of a Bayesian ideal observer performing causal inference cannot explain this improvement, demonstrating that humans deviate systematically from the ideal observer model.",765,138,346,17.0

However, some dogs experience their veterinary visits negatively, which poses a risk of injury to the veterinary staff, their guardian (owner) and themselves during veterinary examinations. It may also influence the regularity of non-urgent veterinary appointments. To date there has been conflicting data on the proportion of dogs that are fearful during their veterinary visits. In this study, we explored the risk factors associated with fear during veterinary examination and in novel situations (including first time at the veterinary clinic) from 26,555 responses in the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire database. According to their guardians, over half (55%) of companion dogs displayed some form of fearful behaviour (mild-extreme) when examined by a veterinarian, while 14% of dogs exhibited severe or extreme fear. A similar trend was observed with dogs responding fearfully in unfamiliar situations, including the dog’s first time at the veterinary clinic. Chi-squared tests showed every bivariate relationship was significant (p &lt; 0.05). The most important predictors of fear in a veterinary examination were, in order: the dog’s breed group (27.1%), their history of roles or activities (16.7%), where they were sourced (15.2%), their weight (12%), the age of other dogs in the household (9.5%) and dog owner experience (6.3%). However, these risk factors accumulate to explain a total of 7% of variance of fear observed during veterinary examination. Results demonstrate that fear of veterinary visits is common in dogs, but that other factors (including the environment or human-animal interactions) are likely to contribute more to prevalence and severity of this problem than the demographic factors measured here. Finally, we highlight opportunities for future research aimed at facilitating less stressful veterinary visits for dogs and their guardians.",837,293,562,26.0

However, we know little about how individual microbial species contribute to communication along the gut-brain axis. Vertebrate microbiomes are comprised of hundreds of species, making it difficult to systematically target individual microbes and their interactions. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a simple model organism to tease apart individual and combined effects of gut microbes on cognition. We used an aversive phototactic suppression assay to show that two dominant gut commensals in our lab stock, Lactobacillus and Acetobacter, are necessary and sufficient for normal learning and short-term memory relative to flies with a conventional microbiome. We also demonstrate that microbes did not affect their hosts’ ability to detect the aversive learning stimulus (quinine), suggesting that our results were due to decreased cognition and not sensory deficits. We thus establish Drosophila as a model for elucidating mechanisms of gut-brain communication at the level of individual bacterial species.",2371,226,916,18.0

Over the years, workers have postulated as to what the exact signal-producing mechanisms of psyllids might be but the exact mechanism has remained elusive. The aim of this study is to determine the specific signal-producing structures and mechanisms of the psyllids. Here we examine six hypotheses of signal-producing mechanisms from both previous and current studies that include: wing vibration, wing-wing friction, wing-thorax friction, wing-leg friction, leg-abdomen friction, and axillary sclerite-thorax friction. Through selective removal of possible signal producing structures and observing wing-beat frequency with a high-speed video recorder, six hypotheses were tested. Extensive experiments were implemented on the species Macrohomotoma gladiata Kuwayama, while other species belonging to different families, i.e., Trioza sozanica (Boselli), Mesohomotoma camphorae Kuwayama, Cacopsylla oluanpiensis (Yang), and Cacopsylla tobirae (Miyatake) were also examined to determine the potential prevalence of each signal-producing mechanism within the Psylloidea. Further, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine possible rubbing structures. The result of high speed photography showed that wing-beating frequency did not match the dominant frequency of vibrational signals, resulting in the rejection of wing vibration hypothesis. As for the selective removal experiments, the axillary sclerite-thorax friction hypothesis is accepted and wing-thorax friction hypothesis is supported partially, while others are rejected. The SEM showed that the secondary axillary sclerite of forewing bears many protuberances that would be suitable for stridulation. In conclusion, the signal-producing mechanism of psyllids involves two sets of morphological structures. The first is stridulation between the axillary cord and anal area of the forewing. The second is stridulation between the axillary sclerite of the forewing and the mesothorax.",929,288,305,34.0

Due to the quantitative limitations of existing methods, colour and pattern are rarely analysed in conjunction with one another, despite a large body of literature and decades of research on the importance of spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses. Furthermore, key physiological limitations of animal visual systems such as spatial acuity, spectral sensitivities, photoreceptor abundances and receptor noise levels are rarely considered together in colour pattern analyses.Here, we present a novel analytical framework, called the ‘Quantitative Colour Pattern Analysis’ (QCPA). We have overcome many quantitative and qualitative limitations of existing colour pattern analyses by combining calibrated digital photography and visual modelling. We have integrated and updated existing spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses, including adjacency, visual contrast and boundary strength analysis, to be implemented using calibrated digital photography through the ‘Multispectral Image Analysis and Calibration’ (MICA) Toolbox.This combination of calibrated photography and spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses is enabled by the inclusion of psychophysical colour and luminance discrimination thresholds for image segmentation, which we call ‘Receptor Noise Limited Clustering’, used here for the first time. Furthermore, QCPA provides a novel psycho-physiological approach to the modelling of spatial acuity using convolution in the spatial or frequency domains, followed by ‘Receptor Noise Limited Ranked Filtering’ to eliminate intermediate edge artefacts and recover sharp boundaries following smoothing. We also present a new type of colour pattern analysis, the ‘Local Edge Intensity Analysis’ (LEIA) as well as a range of novel psycho-physiological approaches to the visualisation of spatiochromatic data.QCPA combines novel and existing pattern analysis frameworks into what we hope is a unified, user-friendly, free and open source toolbox and introduce a range of novel analytical and data-visualisation approaches. These analyses and tools have been seamlessly integrated into the MICA toolbox providing a dynamic and user-friendly workflow.QCPA is a framework for the empirical investigation of key theories underlying the design, function and evolution of colour patterns in nature.

In particular, vision has appeared to be a central feature to gather external information and influence the collective organization of the group. Here we show that a vision based model of collective behavior is sufficient to generate organized collective behavior in the absence of spatial representation and collision. Our work suggests a novel approach for development of purely vision-based autonomous swarm robotic systems, and formulates a mathematical framework for exploration of perception-based interactions and how they differ from physical ones.

Despite this, the mechanisms that underpin it are still unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether the PSE arises from higher-order social and cognitive processes that are unique to humans or, instead, reflects more fundamental processes that drive feeding, such as conditioned food-seeking. Importantly, studies in rodents and other animals have yet to show convincing evidence of a PSE. In this series of studies, we used several methods to test for a PSE in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Our approaches included using visually identifiable portions of a palatable food; training on a plate cleaning procedure; providing portion sizes of food pellets that were signaled by auditory and visual food-predictive cues; providing food with amorphous shape properties; and providing standard chow diet portions in home cages. In none of these manipulations did larger portions increase food intake. In summary, our data provide no evidence that a PSE is present in male Sprague Dawley rats, and if it is, it is more nuanced, dependent on experimental procedure, and/or smaller in size than it is in humans. In turn, these findings suggest that the widely-replicated PSE in humans may be more likely to reflect higher-order cognitive and social processes than fundamental conditioned behaviors.HighlightsPortion size effect (PSE) refers to increased food intake induced by large portions.Although widely replicated in human feeding studies, it may not exist animals.Presence of a PSE in animals would shed light on mechanisms, which are not known.Here, we find no evidence of PSE in male Sprague Dawley rats under a number of experimental conditions.This suggests that the human PSE is more likely due to socio-cognitive processes.",1484,360,710,22.0

One such imprinted gene is Grb10, of which the paternal allele is currently recognized as mediating social dominance behavior. However, there has been no detailed study of social dominance in Grb10+/p mice. Moreover, the original study examined tube-test behavior in isolated mice 10 months of age. Isolation testing favors more territorial and aggressive behaviors, and does not address social dominance strategies employed in group housing contexts. Furthermore, isolation stress impacts midbrain function and dominance related behavior, often through alterations in monoaminergic signaling. Thus, we undertook a systematic study of Grb10+/p social rank and dominance behavior within the cage group, using a number of convergent behavioral tests. We examined both male and female mice to account for sex differences, and tested cohorts aged 2, 6, and 10 months to examine any developments related to age. We found group-housed Grb10+/p mice do not show evidence of enhanced social dominance, but cages containing Grb10+/p and wildtype mice lacked the normal correlation between three different measures of social rank. Moreover, a separate study indicated isolation stress induced inconsistent changes in tube test behavior. Taken together, these data suggest future research on Grb10+/p mice should focus on on the stability of social behaviors, rather than dominance per se.",983,257,381,33.0

Results of recent large-scale studies suggest that many of these hormone-linked behavioral changes are less robust than was previously thought. One specific hypothesis that has not yet been subject to a large-scale test is the proposal that women’s preference for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle. Consequently, we used a longitudinal design to investigate the relationship between changes in women’s steroid hormone levels and their perceptions of faces experimentally manipulated to possess kinship cues (Study 1). Analyses suggested that women viewed men’s faces displaying kinship cues more positively (i.e., more attractive and trustworthy) when estradiol-to-progesterone ratio was high. Since estradiol-to-progesterone ratio is positively associated with conception risk during the menstrual cycle, these results directly contradict the hypothesis that women’s preference for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle. Study 2 employed a daily diary approach and found no evidence that women reported spending less time in the company of male kin or thought about male kin less often during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new database of pictures of facial expressions reflecting the richness of mental states. 93 expressions of mental states were interpreted by two professional actors and high-quality pictures were taken under controlled conditions in front and side view. The database was validated with two different experiments (N=65). First, a four-alternative forced choice paradigm was employed to test the ability of participants to correctly select a term associated with each expression. In a second experiment, we employed a paradigm that did not rely on any semantic information. The task was to locate each face within a two-dimensional space of valence and arousal (mental state – space) employing a “point-and-click” paradigm. Results from both experiments demonstrate that subjects can reliably recognize a great diversity of emotional states from facial expressions. Interestingly, while subjects’ performance was better for front view images, the advantage over the side view was not dramatic. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the high degree of accuracy human viewers exhibit when identifying complex mental states from only partially visible facial features. The McGill Face Database provides a wide range of facial expressions that can be linked to mental state terms and can be accurately characterized in terms of arousal and valence.",1271,167,452,14.0

In a single nest, host and intruder are likely to engage in intense conflict, due to their nestmate discrimination system. An intriguing question is how individuals cope with such a burden in the long term. Evasive behaviour has been previously suggested as a mechanism that reduces the frequency of encounters between non-nestmates. However, due to confinement imposed by the nests’ physical boundaries, it is likely that hosts and inquilines would eventually come across each other. Under these circumstances, it is plausible that inquilines would be required to behave accordingly to secure their housing. Here, we tested this hypothesis predicting that, once inevitably exposed to hosts, inquiline individuals would modulate their behaviour to circumvent conflict. While exploring the behavioural dynamics of the encounter between both cohabitants, we find evidence for an unusual lack of aggressiveness by inquilines towards hosts. Such a non-aggressive behaviour is characterised by evasive manoeuvres that include reversing direction, bypassing and a defensive mechanism using defecation to repel hosts. The behavioural adaptations we describe may play an intrinsic role in the stability of cohabitations between termite species: by reducing the costs of conflicts to both cohabitants, it may improve the chances for stable nest-sharing considerably.",1294,183,392,24.0

Grewal, Jeffrey A. Riffell",585075;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/585075,"Mosquitoes are prolific disease vectors that affect public health around the world. Although many studies have investigated search strategies used by host-seeking adult mosquitoes, little is known about larval search behavior. Larval behavior affects adult body size and fecundity, and thus the capacity of individual mosquitoes to find hosts and transmit disease. Understanding vector survival at all life stages is crucial for improving disease control. In this study we use experimental and computational methods to investigate the chemical ecology and search behavior of Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae. We show that larvae do not respond to several olfactory cues used by adult Ae. aegypti to assess larval habitat quality, but perceive microbial RNA as a potent foraging attractant. Second, we demonstrate that Ae. aegypti larvae use a strategy consistent with chemokinesis, rather than chemotaxis, to navigate chemical gradients. Using computational modeling, we further show that chemokinesis is more efficient than chemotaxis for avoiding repellents in ecologically relevant larval habitat sizes. Finally, we use experimental observations and computational analyses to demonstrate that larvae respond to starvation pressure by optimizing exploration behavior. Our results identify key characteristics of foraging behavior in a disease vector mosquito, including the identification of a surprising foraging attractant and an unusual behavioral mechanism for chemosensory preference. In addition to implications for better understanding and control of disease vectors, this work establishes mosquito larvae as a tractable model for chemosensory behavior and navigation.",1158,187,470,15.0

In the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus, females mate preferentially with males that were exposed to volatiles released by guava fruit or treated with methoprene (a JH analogue). Here, we tested the hypothesis that female choice confers direct fitness benefits in terms of fecundity and fertility. We first carried out mate choice experiments presenting females with males treated and non-treated with guava volatiles or, alternatively, treated and non-treated with methoprene. After we confirm female preference for treated males, we compared the fecundity and fertility between females mated with treated males and non-treated ones. We found that A. fraterculus females that mated with males exposed to guava volatiles showed higher fecundity than females mated to non-exposed males. On the other hand, females that mated methoprene-treated males showed no evidence of direct benefits.

The influence of peers and other social cues on drug-seeking has garnered more attention recently, but few studies have investigated the ability of social cues to gain incentive-motivational value. In the present study, a Pavlovian conditioned approach procedure was used to identify rats that are more (sign-trackers) or less (goal-trackers) prone to attribute incentive salience to food reward cues. A novel procedure then employed social ‘peers’ to compare the tendency of sign-trackers and goal-trackers to attribute incentive salience to social reward cues. Social behavior of sign-trackers and goal-trackers was also compared using social interaction and choice tests. Finally, basal levels of plasma oxytocin were measured in sign-trackers and goal-trackers, because oxytocin is known to modulate the mesolimbic reward system and social behavior. Compared to goal-trackers, sign-trackers attributed more incentive salience to social cues and exhibited more prosocial behaviors. No group differences were observed in baseline plasma oxytocin levels. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate a concordance of individual variation in social behavior, the attribution of incentive salience to social cues following peer interaction, and attribution of incentive salience to food cues. This general tendency to attribute motivational value to reward cues has important implications for the pathophysiology of addiction and other disorders of reward learning.AbbreviationsCSconditioned stimulus;DAdopamine;ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay;GTgoal-tracker;KORkappa opioid receptor;NAcnucleus accumbens;OXToxytocin;PCAPavlovian conditioned approach;STsign-tracker;USunconditioned stimulus;VIvariable interval",951,134,318,29.0

Instead of direct communication, a variety of behavioral, biochemical, physiological, and physical parameters are employed to evaluate the well-being of an animal. Especially in the field of biomedical research, scientifically sound tools to assess pain, suffering, and distress for experimental animals are highly demanded due to ethical and legal reasons. For mice, the most commonly used laboratory animals, a valuable tool is the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), a coding system for facial expressions of pain in mice which has been shown to be accurate and reliable. Currently, MGS scoring is very time and effort consuming as it is manually performed by humans being thoroughly trained in using this method. Therefore, we aim to develop a fully automated system for the surveillance of well-being in mice. Our work introduces a semi-automated pipeline as a first step towards this goal. We use and provide a new data set of images of black-furred laboratory mice that were moving freely, thus the images contain natural variation with regard to perspective and background. The analysis of this data set is therefore more challenging but reflects realistic conditions as it would be obtainable without human intervention. Images were obtained after anesthesia (with isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine combination) and surgery (castration). We deploy two pre-trained state of the art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (ResNet50 and InceptionV3) and compare to a third CNN architecture without pre-training. Depending on the particular treatment, we achieve an accuracy of up to 99% for binary “pain”/”no-pain” classification.Author summary In the field of animal research, it is crucial to assess the well-being of an animal. For mice, the most commonly used laboratory animals, there is a variety of indicators for well-being. Especially the facial expression of a mouse can give us important information on its well-being state. However, currently the surveillance of well-being can only be ensured if a human is present. Therefore, we developed a first approach towards a fully automated surveillance of the well-being status of a mouse. We trained neural networks on face images of black-furred mice, which were either untreated or underwent anesthesia or surgery, to distinguish between an impaired and unimpaired well-being state. Our systems successfully learnt to assess whether the well-being of a mouse was impaired and, depending on the particular treatment, its decision was correct in up to 99%. A tool that visualizes the features used for the decision making process indicated that the decision was mainly based on the facial expressions of a mouse.",1805,286,731,30.0

Scott-Samuel",428193;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/428193,"Avoiding detection can provide significant survival advantages for prey, predators, or the military; conversely, maximising visibility would be useful for signalling. One simple determinant of detectability is an animal’s colour relative to its environment. But identifying the optimal colour to minimise (or maximise) detectability in a given natural environment is complex, partly because of the nature of the perceptual space. Here for the first time, using image processing techniques to embed targets into realistic environments together with psychophysics to estimate detectability and deep neural networks to interpolate between sampled colours, we propose a method to identify the optimal colour that either minimises or maximises visibility. We apply our approach in two natural environments (temperate forest and semi-arid desert) and show how a comparatively small number of samples can be used to predict robustly the most and least effective colours for camouflage. To illustrate how our approach can be generalised to other non-human visual systems, we also identify the optimum colours for concealment and visibility when viewed by simulated red-green colour-blind dichromats, typical for non-human mammals. Contrasting the results from these visual systems sheds light on why some predators seem, at least to humans, to have colouring that would appear detrimental to ambush hunting. We found that for simulated dichromatic observers, colour strongly affected detection time for both environments. In contrast, trichromatic observers were more effective at breaking camouflage.Author Summary Being the right colour is important in a natural and built environment, both for hiding (and staying alive) or being seen (and keeping safe). However, empirically establishing what these colours might be for a given environment is non-trivial, depending on factors such as size, viewing distance, lighting and occlusion. Indeed, even with a small number of factors, such as colour and occlusion, this is impractical. Using artificial intelligence techniques, we propose a method that uses a modest number of samples to predict robustly the most and least effective colours for camouflage. Our method generalises for classes of observer other than humans with normal (trichromatic) vision, which we show by identifying the optimum colours for simulated red-green colour-blind observers, typical for non-human mammals, as well as for different environments, using temperate forest and semi-arid desert. Our results reveal that colour strongly affects detection time for simulated red-green colour-blind observers in both environments, but normal trichromatic observers were far more effective at breaking camouflage and detecting targets, with effects of colour being much smaller.

Moreover, many studies showed that blue light enhances alertness and performance in cognitive tasks. However, most of scientific reports in this topic is based on studies using short exposure to blue or blue-enriched light and only few focused on the effects of its reduced transmittance, especially in longer period. The latter could potentially give insight into understanding if age-related sleep problems and cognitive decline are related to less amount of blue light reaching the retina, as our lenses become more yellow with age. In this study, we investigated the effects of prolonged blocking of blue light on cognitive functioning, in particular - sustained attention and visuospatial working memory, and sleep. We used amber contact lenses reducing transmittance of blue light by approximately 90% for the period of four weeks on a group of young, healthy participants. No changes were observed for measurements related to sleep and sleep-wake rhythm. The significant effect was shown both for sustained attention and visuospatial memory, i.e. the longer blocking the blue light lasted, the greater decrease in performance was observed. Additionally, the follow-up session was conducted (approximately one week after taking off the blue-blocking lenses) and revealed that in case of sustained attention this detrimental effect of blocking BL is fully reversible. Our findings provide evidence that prolonged reduction of BL exposure directly affects human cognitive functioning regardless of sleep-related conditions.",1098,174,417,25.0

Here we explored sex differences along these dimensions using multiple and distinct behavioral paradigms. We found no sex difference in reward-guided associative learning but a faster punishment-avoidance learning in females. After learning, females were more sensitive than males to probabilistic punishment but less sensitive when punishment could be avoided with certainty. No sex differences were found in reward-guided cognitive flexibility. Thus, sex differences in goal-directed behaviors emerged selectively when there was an aversive context. These differences were critically sensitive to whether the punishment was certain or unpredictable. Our findings with these new paradigms provide conceptual and practical tools for investigating brain mechanisms that account for sex differences in susceptibility to anxiety and impulsivity. They may also provide insight for understanding the evolution of sex-specific optimal behavioral strategies in dynamic environments.",1711,540,537,35.0

One method of addiction treatment, cue-exposure therapy, utilizes repeated presentations of drug-related cues in the absence of drug (i.e., extinction learning); however, its efficacy has been limited due to an incomplete understanding of extinction and relapse processes after cues have been imbued with incentive-motivational value. To investigate this, we used a Pavlovian conditioned approach procedure to screen for rats that attribute incentive-motivational value to reward-related cues (sign-trackers; STs) or those that do not (goal-trackers; GTs). In Experiment 1, rats underwent Pavlovian extinction followed by reinstatement and spontaneous recovery tests. For comparison, a separate group of rats underwent PCA training followed by operant conditioning, extinction, and tests of reinstatement and spontaneous recovery. In Experiment 2, three cognitive enhancers (sodium butyrate, D-cycloserine, and fibroblast growth factor 2) were administered following extinction training to facilitate extinction learning. STs but not GTs displayed enduring resistance to Pavlovian, but not operant, extinction and were more susceptible to spontaneous recovery. In addition, none of the cognitive enhancers tested affected extinction learning. These results expand our understanding of extinction learning by demonstrating that there is individual variation in extinction and relapse processes and highlight potential difficulties in applying extinction-based therapies to drug addiction treatment in the clinic.",855,147,309,33.0

The Morris water maze task probes spatial learning and memory in rodents and glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone in rats) have been suggested to elicit a facilitating action on memory formation. Moreover, the early aging period (around 16-18 months of age) is susceptible to stress- and glucocorticoid-mediated acceleration of cognitive decline. In this study, we tested three lines of rats selectively bred according to their individual differences in corticosterone responsiveness to repeated stress exposure during juvenility. We investigated whether endogenous differences in glucocorticoid responses influenced spatial learning, long-term memory and reversal learning abilities in a Morris water maze task at early aging. Additionally, we assessed the quality of the different swimming strategies of the rats. Our results indicate that rats with differential corticosterone responsiveness exhibit similar spatial learning abilities but different long-term memory retention and reversal learning. Specifically, the high corticosterone responding line had a better long-term spatial memory, while the low corticosterone responding line was impaired for both long-term retention and reversal learning. Our modeling analysis of performance strategies revealed further important line-related differences. Therefore, our findings support the view that individuals with high corticosterone responsiveness would form stronger long-term memories to navigate in stressful environments. Conversely, individuals with low corticosterone responsiveness would be impaired at different phases of spatial learning and memory.",715,425,293,13.0

Jordan",571232;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/571232,"Although methods for tracking animals underwater exist, they frequently involve costly infrastructure investment, or capture and manipulation of animals to affix or implant tags. These practical concerns limit the taxonomic coverage of aquatic movement ecology studies and implementation in areas where high infrastructure investment is impossible. Here we present a method based on deep-learning and structure-from-motion, with which we can accurately determine the 3D location of animals, the structure of the environment in which they are moving. Further behavioural decomposition of the body position and contour of animals subsequently allow quantifying the behavioural states of each interacting animal. This approach can be used with minimal infrastructure and without confining animals to to a fixed area, or capturing and interfering with them in any way. With this approach, we are able to track single individuals (Conger Eel, Conger oceanus), small heterospecific groups (Mullus surmuletus, Diplodus sp.), and schools of animals (Tanganyikan cichlids Lamprologus callipterus) in freshwater and marine systems, and in habitats ranging in environmental complexity. Positional information was highly accurate, with errors as low as 1.67% of body length. Tracking data was embedded in 3D environmental models that could be used to examine collective decision making, obstacle avoidance, and visual connectivity of groups. By analyzing body contour and position, we were also able to use unsupervised classification to quantify the kinematic behavioural states of each animal. The proposed framework allows us to understand animal behaviour in aquatic systems at an unprecedented resolution and a fraction of the cost of established methodologies, with minimal domain expertise at the data acquisition or analysis phase required. Implementing this method, research can be conducted in a wide range of field contexts to collect laboratory standard data, vastly expanding both the taxonomic and environmental coverage of quantitative animal movement analysis with a low-cost, open-source solution.",2041,249,1133,15.0

Both the process by which goods are to be distributed, and the resulting allocation to the members of the society may affect the success of the population as a whole. One of the most striking natural examples of a highly successful cooperative society is the ant colony which often acts as a single superorganism. In particular, each individual within the ant colony has a “communal stomach” which is used to store and share food with the other colony members by mouth to mouth feeding. Sharing food between communal stomachs allows the colony as a whole to get its food requirements and, more so, allows each individual within the colony to reach its nutritional intake target. The vast majority of colony members do not forage independently but obtain their food through secondary interactions in which food is exchanged between individuals. The global effect of this exchange is not well understood. To gain better understanding into this process we used fluorescence imaging to measure how the collected food is distributed and homogenized within a Camponotus sanctus ant colony. Using entropic measures to quantify food-blending, we show that while collected food flows into all parts of the colony it homogenizes only partly. We show that mixing is controlled by the ants’ interaction rule in which only a fraction of the maximal potential is actually transferred. This rule leads to a robust blending process: i.e., neither the exact food volume that is transferred, nor the interaction schedule are essential to generate the global outcome. Finally, we show how the ants’ interaction rules may optimize a trade-off between fast dissemination and efficient mixing.Author summary We study how food is distributed in colonies of ants. Food collected by a small fraction of ants is distributed throughout the colony through a series of mouth-to-mouth interactions.An interesting interplay exists between food dissemination and food mixing within the colony. High levels of dissemination are important as they ensure that any food type is available to any ant. On the other hand, high dissemination induces mixing and this reduces the required variety of nutritional choices within the colony.Tracking fluorescent-labelled food and interpreting the results within concepts of information theory, we show that food collected by each forager reaches almost every ant in the colony. Nonetheless, it is not homogenized across workers, resulting in a limited level of mixing.We suggest that the difference in food mixture held by each individuals can provide ants the potential to control their nutritional intake by interacting with different partners.",860,125,360,30.0

Quinlan, Darragh Hare",473942;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/473942,"Matriliny is a system of kinship in which descent and inheritance are conferred along the female line. The theoretically influential concept of the matrilineal puzzle posits that matriliny poses special problems for understanding men’s roles in matrilineal societies. Ethnographic work describes the puzzle as the tension experienced by men between the desire to exert control over their natal kin (i.e., the lineage to which they belong) and over their affinal kin (i.e., their spouses and their biological children). Evolutionary work frames the paradox as one resulting from a man investing in his nieces and nephews at the expense of his own biological offspring. In both cases, the rationale for the puzzle rests on two fundamental assumptions: (i) that men are always in positions of authority over women and over resources; and (ii) that men are interested in the outcomes of parenting. In this paper, we posit a novel hypothesis that suggests that certain ecological conditions render men expendable within local kinship configurations, nullifying the above assumptions. This arises when (i) women, without significant assistance from men, are capable of meeting the subsistence needs of their families; and (ii) men have little to gain from parental investment in children. We conclude that the expendable male hypothesis may explain the evolution of matriliny in numerous cases, and by noting that female-centered approaches that call into doubt assumptions inherent to male-centered models of kinship are justified in evolutionary perspective.",2494,1180,954,29.0

In horses, eye wrinkles caused by the contraction of the inner eyebrow raiser have been shown to be affected by pain and other emotional states. Whether individual characteristics of a horse systematically affect eye wrinkle expression has not yet been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess how age, sex, breed type, body condition and coat colour affect the expression and/or the assessment of eye wrinkles in horses. To this end, we adapted the eye wrinkle assessment scale from Hintze et al.

All measures could be assessed highly reliable with respect to intra- and inter-observer agreement. Breed type affected the width of the angle (F2, 114 = 8.20, p &lt; 0.001), with thoroughbreds having the narrowest angle (M = 23.80, SD = 1.60), followed by warmbloods (M = 28.00, SD = 0.60), and coldbloods (M = 31.00, SD = 0.90).

Pigot",566406;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/566406,"SummaryInsights into animal behaviour play an increasingly central role in species-focused conservation practice. However, progress towards incorporating behaviour into regional or global conservation strategies has been far more limited, not least because standardised datasets of behavioural traits are generally lacking at wider taxonomic or spatial scales. Here we make use of the recent expansion of global datasets for birds to assess the prospects for including behavioural traits in systematic conservation priority-setting and monitoring programmes. Using IUCN Red List classification for &gt;9500 bird species, we show that the incidence of threat can vary substantially across different behavioural syndromes, and that some types of behaviour—including particular foraging, mating and migration strategies—are significantly more threatened than others. When all factors are included in a combined model, behavioural traits have a weaker effect than well-established geographical and ecological factors, including range size, body mass and human population pressures. We also show that the association between behavior and extinction risk is partly driven by correlations with these underlying factors. Overall, these results suggest that a multi-species approach at the scale of communities, continents and ecosystems can be used to identify and monitor threatened behaviours, and to flag up cases of latent extinction risk, where threatened status may currently be underestimated. Our findings also highlight the importance of comprehensive standardized descriptive data for ecological and behavioural traits, and point the way forward to a deeper integration of behaviour into quantitative conservation assessments.",993,450,752,20.0

These animals often employ a “conditional approach” strategy, in which an individual approaches the predator in the first move and subsequently approaches it only if a second individual swims even with it during inspection. This strategy is analogous to the “tit-for-tat” strategy of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, suggesting that it could be used to study cooperation. Serotonin is thought to mediate cooperative behavior in other fish species. Exposure to the animated image of a predator in a tank that contained a parallel mirror – mimicking an equally cooperating conspecific – promoted inspection and decreased refuge use, but increased freezing, suggesting that conditional approach is also associated with fear. To understand whether serotonin participates in conditional approach in guppies, we treated animals with either vehicle (Cortland’s salt solution), fluoxetine (2.5 mg/kg) or metergoline (1 mg/kg), and tested then in a predator inspection paradigm. Fluoxetine increased the time the animal spent inspecting the predator image, while metergoline decreased it. Fluoxetine also decreased time spent avoiding the predator and increased freezing, while metergoline decreased freezing. These results suggest that phasic increases in serotonin levels promote conditional approach, suggesting a role for this neurotransmitter in cooperation.Preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/436345; Data and scripts: https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/TFT",1775,145,751,21.0

Background Phenotyping mouse model systems of human disease has proven to be a difficult task, with frequent poor inter- and intra-laboratory replicability and translatability, particularly in behavioral domains such as social and verbal function. However, establishing robust animal model systems with strong construct validity is of fundamental importance as they are central tools for understanding disease pathophysiology and developing therapeutics. To complete our studies of mouse model systems relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we present a replication of the main findings from our two published studies comprising five genetic mouse model systems of ASD.Methods To assess the robustness of our previous results, we chose the two model systems that showed the greatest phenotypic differences, the Shank3/F and Cntnap2, and repeated assessments of general health, activity, and social behavior. We additionally explored all five model systems in the same framework, comparing all results obtained in this three-yearlong effort using informatics techniques to look for commonalities and differences.Results Results in the current study were very similar to our previously published results. The informatics signatures of the two model systems chosen for the replication showed that they were most distinguished by activity levels. Although the two model systems were opposite in this regard, those aspects of their social behavior not confounded by activity (vocalizations) were similar.Conclusions Our results showed high intra-laboratory replicability of results, even for those with effect sizes that were not particularly large, suggesting that discrepancies in the literature may be dependent on subtle differences in testing conditions, housing enrichment, or background strains and not so much on the variability of the behavioral phenotypes. The overall informatics analysis suggests two main classes of model systems that in some aspects lie on opposite ends of the behavioral spectrum, supporting the view that autism is not a unitary concept.",1057,67,361,34.0

Vilette",562231;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/562231,"Networks are often used to describe adaptive social systems, where individual (node) behaviour generates network-level structures that influence subsequent individual-level behaviour. To address questions about the dynamics of network structure in these systems, there is a need to analyze networks through time. Various statistical methods exist for estimating the behaviour of networks in time, in terms of both time-ordered and time-aggregated networks. In this paper, we discuss three main analytical steps for the analysis of time-aggregated network data: 1) aggregation choices, 2) null-model comparisons, and 3) constructing, parameterizing, and making inferences from time series models. We then present a custom R package, netTS, which facilitates these steps. Observed grooming data from a group of vervet monkeys, a highly social primate species, is used as an example to highlight three potential analyses: 1) quantifying the stability of network-level social structures through time, 2) identifying keystone nodes driving/maintaining network structures, and 3) quantifying the interdependence between node behaviour through time. In particular, we highlight the role of bootstrapping, permutation, and simulation as critical components in the analysis of time-aggregated networks.",1321,48,361,24.0

Locomotor activity, food intake and body temperature of group (n=7) of male migratory redheaded buntings held under short days (8L:16D, SD) were monitored besides blood sampling at midday (ZT4: 4 hours zeitgeber time starting ZT0 as lights ‘on’) and midnight (ZT16). The birds exhibited higher activity and increased feeding during daytime with negligible activity and feeding at night. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry and chemo-metric analyses of bird serum revealed higher levels of lipid (palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids) and protein (uric acid and proline) catabolites in daytime serum samples as compared to night samples. Higher night-time levels of short chain fatty acids indicated utilization of glucose and lipolysis in night fasted birds. High night-time levels of taurine, a sulphur amino acid has adaptive advantage to night migratory song birds. The diurnal differences in metabolite patterns suggests differential energy expenditure during day and renders survival benefit to buntings as night migrants. We propose a GCMS method that could be useful to unravel different annual life-history stages including migration.",975,64,297,20.0

Nicholas, Eric A Yttri",560961;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/560961,"SUMMARYFor decades, advanced behavioral tasks have only been used in human and non-human primates. However, with improved analytical and genetic techniques, there has been a growing drive to implement complex reaching, decision-making, and reaction time tasks – not in primates – but in rodents. Here, we assess the hypothesis that a mouse can learn a cued reaction time task. Moreover, we tested multiple training regimens and found that introducing elements of the reaction time task serially hindered, rather than helped task acquisition. Additionally, we include a step-by-step manual for inexpensive implementation and use of a rodent joystick for behavioral analysis. Task and analysis code for the evaluated behaviors are included such that they may be replicated and tested further. With these, we also include code for a probabilistic reward ‘two-arm bandit’ task. These various tasks, and the method to construct and implement them, will enable greatly improved study of the neural correlates of behavior in the powerful mouse model organism. In summary, we have tested and demonstrated that mice can learn sophisticated tasks with A joystick, and that targeted task design provides a significant advantage. These results of this study stand to inform the implementation of other sophisticated tasks using the mouse model.",1698,107,651,21.0

Hence, some form of kin recognition is useful for individuals to optimize their behaviour. In species displaying bi-parental care and subject to extra-pair matings, kin recognition theoretically allows cuckolded fathers to reduce their parental investment, and thus optimize their fitness, but whether this is possible remains unclear in birds. This study investigates the ability of male sparrows to recognize their own chicks, using a large cross-foster experiment, parental care as an indicator and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) as a model organism. We cross-fostered chicks after hatching, and then expected that fathers would show a decrease in their parental efforts when tending to a clutch of unrelated offspring. However, there was no significant effect of relatedness on provisioning rates. This suggests that sparrows may not be capable of kin recognition, or at least do not display kin discrimination despite its apparent evolutionary advantage.",1164,50,277,18.0

Phenotypes of Williams syndrome include cardiovascular problems, craniofacial dysmorphology, deficits in visual spatial cognition, and a characteristic hypersocial personality. There are still no genes in the region that have been consistently linked to the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, although human studies and mouse models have led to the current hypothesis that the general transcription factor 2 I family of genes, GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, are responsible. Here we test the hypothesis that these two transcription factors are sufficient to reproduce the phenotypes that are caused by deletion of the Williams syndrome critical region (WSCR). We compare a new mouse model with loss of function mutations in both Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1 to an established mouse model lacking the complete WSCR. We show that the complete deletion model has deficits across several behavioral domains including social communication, motor functioning, and conditioned fear that are not explained by loss of function mutations in Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling of the hippocampus shows changes in synaptic genes in the complete deletion model that are not seen in the double mutants.

Therefore, management of blood oxygen transportation to peripheral tissues by cardiovascular adjustments while diving is crucial to maximize benefits from dives. However, heart rate, particularly cardiac response to exercise in free-ranging dives, has rarely been examined for sea turtles. In this study, heart rate and its relationship with the amount of activity were determined in six free-ranging green turtles using bio-logging techniques. Our results demonstrated that resting heart rate took 7–11 h to reduce to steady levels after turtles were released in the tank, indicating that turtles may not present normal physiological rates right after release. After heart rate reduction, resting heart rate of green turtles in free-ranging dives was generally low (10.9 ± 2.5 bpm), but they often presented arrhythmia (4–54 bpm) even in resting states. The amount of activity during a dive linearly increased heart rate, but maximum heart rates (39.0–69.8 bpm) were recorded during ventilation at surface. These results indicate that turtles have the capability of cardiac response to increased metabolic demands in their muscles while submerged, and also of cardiovascular adjustment for a rapid renewal of oxygen stores and removal of CO2 during ventilation. Such well-organized cardiac adjustments may be because of characteristics of Cheloniidae sea turtles such as ectothermy and oxygen storage in lungs while submerged.Summary statement Green sea turtles in free-ranging dive had generally lower heart rate compared to other air-breathing divers and it varied with the amount of exercise.

We have automated the detection of these bouts and their discrete properties including bout sizes, rates, durations, and intensities. We have developed a hierarchically organized model of behavioral organization enabling analysis of relationships among Active/Inactive State properties and those of feeding, drinking and locomotor bouts. Robust and analogous patterns of interrelationships among these endophenotypes were found for feeding, drinking behaviors, and these differed markedly from those for locomotor behaviors. For feeding and drinking, patterns of reciprocal relationships were observed for pairs of endophenotypes at multiple hierarchical levels. Moreover, endophenotype variability was highest at lowest hierarchical levels progressively diminished at higher levels, so that variability of gross levels of food and water intake were much less than those of their lower level determinants. By contrast, interrelationships among locomotor endophenotypes differed markedly from those of ingestive behavior. Altogether, these findings raise the possibility that behavioral regulation of food and water intake may make an important contribution to the homeostatic maintenance of energy and volume balance.",1220,114,291,24.0

Such a system offers universal challenges for multiobject tracking, while being conveniently accessible for image recording. We first apply an accurate, segmentation-based object detection method to build initial short trajectory segments by matching object configurations based on class, position and orientation. We then join these tracks into full single object trajectories by creating an object recognition model which is adaptively trained to recognize honeybee individuals through their visual appearance across multiple frames, an attribute we denote as pixel personality. Overall, we reconstruct ∼ 46% of the trajectories in 5 min recordings from two different hives and over 71% of the tracks for at least 2 min. We provide validated trajectories spanning 3, 000 video frames of 876 unmarked moving bees in two distinct colonies in different locations and filmed with different pixel resolutions, which we expect to be useful in the further development of general-purpose tracking solutions.",725,63,304,13.0

Data were collected from 8 multi- and 4 primiparous cows (DIM = 199 ± 44 (mean ± SD); days pregnant = 77 ± 30). Using a crossover design, each cow experienced: 1) sleep deprivation implemented by noise or physical contact when their posture suggested sleep, and 2) lying deprivation imposed by a grid placed on the pen floor. One day before treatment (baseline), and treatment day (treatment) were followed by a 12-d washout period. Study days were organized from 2100 to 2059. During habituation (d −3 and −2 before treatment), baseline (d −1), and trt (d 0), housing was individual boxstalls (mattress with no bedding). After treatment, cows returned to sand-bedded freestalls for a 7-d recovery period (d 1 to 7) where data on lying behaviors were collected. Daily lying time, number lying bouts, bout duration, and number of steps were recorded by dataloggers attached to the hind leg of cows throughout the study period. Data were analyzed using a mixed model in SAS including fixed effects of treatment (sleep deprivation vs. sleep and lying deprivation), day, and their interaction with significant main effects separated using a PDIFF statement (P ≤ 0.05). Interactions between treatment and day were detected for daily lying time and the number of bouts. Lying time was lower for both treatments during the treatment period compared to baseline. Lying time increased during the recovery period for both lying and sleep deprived cows. However, it took 4 d for the lying deprived cows to fully recover their lying time after treatment, whereas it took the sleep deprived cows 2 d for their lying time to return to baseline levels. Results suggest that both sleep and lying deprivation can have impact cow behavior. Management factors that limit freestall access likely reduce lying time and sleep, causing negative welfare implications for dairy cows.",817,94,285,35.0

We investigated if young rats can learn to associate the presence of an odour with the experience of being tickled (i.e. using an experimenter’s hand to mimic rough-and-tumble play), shown to elicit 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), which are indicative of positive affect. Male, pair-housed Wistar rats (N=24) were all exposed to two neutral odours (A and B) presented in a perforated container on alternate days in a test arena. Following 60s of exposure, the rats were either tickled on days when odour A (n=8) or odour B (n=8) was present, or never tickled (n=8). When tickled, rats produced significantly more 50 kHz USVs compared to the days when not being tickled, and compared to control rats. The level of anticipatory 50 kHz USVs in the 60s prior to tickling did not differ significantly between the tickled and control rats. Following the odour conditioning, rats were exposed successively in the same arena to three odours: an unknown neutral odour, extract of fox faeces, and either odours A or B. Compared to controls, 50 kHz USVs of tickled rats increased when exposed to the odour they had previously experienced when tickled, indicating that these rats had learned to associate the odour with the positive experience of being tickled. In a test with free access for 5 min to both arms of a T-maze, each containing one of the odours, rats tickled with odour A spent more time in the arm with this odour. This work is the first to test in a fully balanced design whether odours can be conditioned to tickling, and indicates that positive odour conditioning has potential to be used as an alternative to negative conditioning tests.",941,55,287,27.0

To address this challenge, we developed an integrated platform for automated animal training and analysis of behavioral data. A low-cost and space-efficient apparatus serves to train entire cohorts of mice on a decision-making task under identical conditions. A generalized linear model (GLM) analyzes each animal’s performance at single-trial resolution.

Such feedback-based changes in behavior rely on long term plasticity within cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic networks, driven by dopaminergic modulation of cortical inputs to the direct and indirect pathway neurons of the striatum. While the firing rates of corticostriatal neurons have been shown to adapt across a range of feedback conditions, it remains difficult to directly assess the corticostriatal synaptic weight changes that contribute to these adaptive firing rates. In this work, we simulate a computational model for the evolution of corticostriatal synaptic weights based on a spike timing-dependent plasticity rule driven by dopamine signaling that is induced by outcomes of actions in the context of a two-alternative forced choice task. Results show that plasticity predominantly impacts direct pathway weights, which evolve to drive action selection toward a more-rewarded action in settings with deterministic reward outcomes. After the model is tuned based on such fixed reward scenarios, its performance agrees with the results of behavioral experiments carried out with probabilistic reward paradigms.",808,72,351,25.0

The relevant feature of representation is its ability to designate (stand in for) spatially or temporally distant properties, When we organize our behavior with respect to mental or neural representations, we are (in principle) organizing our behavior with respect to the property it designates. While representational theories are a potentially a powerful foundation for a good cognitive theory, problems such as grounding and system-detectable error remain unsolved. For these and other reasons, ecological explanations reject the need for representations and do not treat the nervous system as doing any mediating work. However, this has left us without a straight-forward vocabulary to engage with so-called ‘representation-hungry’ problems or the role of the nervous system in cognition.In an effort to develop such a vocabulary, here we show that James J Gibson’s ecological information functions to designate the ecologically-scaled dynamical world to an organism. We then show that this designation analysis of information leads to an ecological conceptualization of the neural activity caused by information, which in turn we argue can together support intentional behavior with respect to spatially and temporally distal properties. Problems such as grounding and error detection are solved via law-based specification. This analysis extends the ecological framework into the realm of ‘representation-hungry’ problems, making it as powerful a potential basis for theories of behavior as traditional cognitive approaches. The resulting analysis does, according to some definitions, allow information and the neural activity to be conceptualized as representations; however, the key work is done by information and the analysis remains true to Gibson’s ecological ontology.",6245,267,2535,32.0

Traps were subjected to two food access difficulties three-night consecutive treatments: open plastic bottles and closed bottles, both using corn as bait. To generate predation risk, we set fox faeces in half of the traps in each plot. Also, we considered indirect predator cues as the moon phase. We analyse whether mice had bitten the bottles and the area gnawed of each bottle was measured. We discovered that mice feeding decisions and efforts were driven by food access difficulty, experience and predation risk. The ability of mice to properly balance their energy budget was probed since they bit and performed bigger orifices in the closed bottles, hence, individuals can adapt the feeding effort when a new food source is available. Moreover, experience was determinant in the use of this new resource since recaptured mice gnawed the bottles more successfully and the skill was improved each time an individual was recaptured. Additionally, direct predation risk cues prompt mice to bite the bottles whereas the effect of different moon phases varied among the treatments. This is the first study that provides direct evidence of wild mice formidable efficacy to exploit a new nutrient resource while deepening in crucial environmental factors that shape decision-making procedure.",1213,64,371,29.0

A less commonly known function of mucus secretion in this group involves its use as a defence against predation. Among the terrestrial slugs, mucus that serves this particular purpose has been studied for only a handful of species under laboratory conditions, where it is thought to be produced for self-fouling or to make individuals difficult to consume. However, the mechanisms of how these defensive secretions operate and their effectiveness in deterring predation in the natural world have not be described in much detail. In this study, we provide evidence of adhesive mucus secretions in the red triangle slug (Triboniophorus graeffei) as an adaptation against predation. Field observations of a large red-eyed green tree frog (Litoria chloris) trapped in the mucus secretions of a nearby T. graeffei revealed that this mucus serves to incapacitate predators rather than just simply as an overall deterrence. Mechanical stimulation of T. graeffei under laboratory conditions revealed that adhesive secretions were produced from discrete sections of the dorsal surface when disturbed, leading to the production of a highly sticky and elastic mucus that was unlike the thin and slippery mucus used during locomotion. The adhesiveness of the defensive secretions was strengthened and reactivated when in contact with water. This appears to not only be the first description of defensive mucus production in this slug species but one of the first natural observations of the use of adhesive defence secretions to incapacitate a predator. The biomechanical properties of this mucus and its ability to maintain and strengthen its hold under wet conditions make it potentially useful in the development of new adhesive materials.",2608,360,1350,17.0

We probed the behavior of male and female fruit flies in a circular arena as individuals and within all possible pairings. By combining measurements of the animals’ position in the arena with an unsupervised analysis of their behaviors, we fully define the effects of position in the environment and the presence of a partner on locomotion, grooming, singing, and other behaviors that make up an animal’s repertoire.

Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) is an integrative ‘whole animal’ measure that captures the expressive quality of an animal’s demeanour, using descriptors such as ‘relaxed’, ‘anxious’, and ‘playful’. In this study, for the first time, we developed and tested a fixed-list of qualitative QBA descriptors for application to dogs living in kennels. A list of 20 QBA descriptors was developed based on literature search and an expert opinion survey. Inter-observer reliability was investigated by asking 11 observers to use these descriptors to score 13 video clips of kennelled dogs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract four main dimensions together explaining 70.9% of the total variation between clips. PC1 characterised curious/playful/excitable, sociable demeanour, PC2 ranged from comfortable/relaxed to anxious/nervous/stressed expression, PC3 described fearful demeanour, and PC4 characterized bored/depressed demeanour. Observers’ agreement on the ranking of video clips on these four expressive dimensions was good (Kendall’s W: 0.60-0.80). ANOVA showed a significant effect of observer on mean clip score on all PCs (p&lt;0.05) due to a few observers scoring differently from the rest of the group. These results indicate the potential of the proposed list of QBA terms for sheltered dogs to serve as a non-invasive, easy-to-use assessment tool. However, the observers’ effect on mean scores points towards the need for adequate observer training. The QBA scoring tool can be integrated with existing welfare assessment protocols for shelter dogs and strengthen the power of those protocols to assess and evaluate the animals’ experience in shelters.",1317,90,577,28.0

Genetic deletion of Sap47 leads to deficiencies in short-term plasticity and associative memory processing in flies. In mice, Syap1 is prominently expressed in the nervous system, but its function is still unclear. We have generated Syap1 knockout mice and tested motor behaviour and memory. These mice are viable and fertile but display distinct deficiencies in motor behaviour. Locomotor activity specifically appears to be reduced in early phases when voluntary movement is initiated. On the rotarod, a more demanding motor test involving control by sensory feedback, Syap1-deficient mice dramatically fail to adapt to accelerated speed or to a change in rotation direction. Syap1 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei. Thus, this distinct motor phenotype could be due to a so far unknown function of Syap1 in cerebellar sensorimotor control. The observed motor defects are highly specific since other tests in the modified SHIRPA test, as well as cognitive tasks like novel object recognition, Pavlovian fear conditioning, and anxiety-like behaviour in open field, dark-light transition, and elevated plus maze, do not appear to be strongly affected in Syap1 knockout mice.",792,334,383,

Brosi",538702;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/538702,"Given ongoing pollinator declines, it is important to understand the dynamics of linked extinctions of plants driven by pollinator extinctions. Topological robustness models focused on this question suggest relatively high robustness of plant species to pollinator species extinctions. Still, existing robustness models typically assume that all interactions in plant-pollinator networks are positive, which is clearly not always the case. For example, many pollinators remove floral resources with-out transferring pollen, or even damage floral structures in the case of nectar robbing. Here we introduce antagonistic interactions into plant-pollinator networks and assess the resilience of plant communities to pollinator species losses. Incorporating antagonistic interactions leads to lower network robustness, i.e. an increased rate of plant species loss (as compared to networks with only mutualistic interactions) in empirical plant-pollinator networks. In conjunction with extinction order, the addition of increasingly antagonistic interactions was idiosyncratic in that it did not always magnify the effects of extinction order across the three networks. These results underscore the importance of considering the full spectrum of interaction outcomes when assessing robustness to coextinctions in plant-pollinator networks, as well as other ecological systems.",1061,67,433,25.0

Patiño, Kenneth E. Glander, Nathaniel J. Dominy",539023;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/539023,"The eponymous vocalizations of howling monkeys (genus Alouatta) are associated with territorial defense and male-male competition, yet the extreme loudness of howls, which are among the loudest vocalizations of any terrestrial mammal, have yet to be fully explained. Loudness facilitates long-distance sound propagation but the effectiveness of any vocal signal depends in part on the auditory capabilities of the intended receiver, and the auditory sensitivities of howling monkeys are unknown. To better understand the evolution of loud calls, we used the auditory brainstem response (ABR) method to estimate the auditory sensitivities of Alouatta palliata. The mean estimated audiogram of four wild-caught adults displayed a w-shaped pattern with two regions of enhanced sensitivity centered at 0.7-1.0 and 11.3 kHz. The lower-frequency region of auditory sensitivity is pitched moderately higher than the fundamental frequencies of howling, whereas the higher-frequency region corresponds well with harmonics in an infant distress call, the wrah-ha. Fitness advantages from detecting infants amid low-frequency background noise, including howling, could explain the incongruity between our ABR thresholds and the fundamental frequencies of howling. Attending to infant calls is expected to enhance reproductive success within an infanticidal genus, and we suggest that the extraordinary loudness of male howling is an indirect (runaway) result of positive feedback between the selective pressures of hearing infant distress calls and deterring infanticide.",1394,103,1077,17.0

In a previous study such bingeing was found when rats were given 4% sucrose solution; it also found that, following 1-in-4-days access for many weeks, intakes remained persistently higher than that of controls even when the conditions were changed to 1-in-2-days access for both groups. One aim of the three experiments reported here was to test whether such persistent bingeing could be found for other solutions. This was confirmed in rats for a saccharin solution and a highly palatable saccharin-plus-glucose solution. However, when a maltodextrin solution was used, initial increased intakes produced by the 1-in-4-days schedule were not maintained when this was changed to a 1-in-2-days schedule. These results suggested that the hedonic value of a solution is more important than its caloric content in determining whether it will support persistent bingeing. A second aim was to test for evidence that the 1-in-4-days procedure induced an addiction to the target solution. No such evidence was found using multiple measures including instrumental responding and anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze for craving and withdrawal respectively.",806,121,354,45.0

The most important GIT partners are the p21-activated protein kinase-interacting exchange factor (PIX) proteins, since through homomeric and heteromeric interactions, GIT and PIX proteins form oligomeric GIT/PIX complexes. Oligomeric GIT/PIX complexes function both as regulators of small GTP-binding proteins and as scaffolds for signalling molecules, including p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs). Deficits in learning and memory have been demonstrated in GIT1 knockout mice, and it has been assumed that GIT2 also would affect learning and memory. Unexpectedly, we find that GIT2-deficient mice respond normally in multiple tests of learning and memory, and have normal hippocampal long-term potentiation. Further, we find no evidence that GIT2 regulates ADHD-like phenotypes. To investigate why GIT2 and GIT1 differ so markedly in the brain, we identified the major isoform of GIT2 in the brain as a previously uncharacterized splice variant, GIT2(ΔBCE). This variant cannot dimerize or form oligomeric complexes with PIX proteins, and is thus incapable of regulating PAK in synapses, compared to oligomeric GIT1/PIX complexes. Because localized activation of PAK in synapses is required for structural plasticity underlying cognitive performance, loss of monomeric GIT2(ΔBCE) in the brain does not influence these responses.",781,135,293,45.0

Orexin-1 receptor (OxR1) antagonism reduces demand for cocaine and remifentanil indicating that orexin-based therapies may reduce demand for many classes of abused drugs. However, pharmacokinetics vary greatly among opioids and it is unclear if OxR1 antagonism would reduce demand for all opioids, particularly ones with particularly high abuse liability. Here, we establish a behavioral economics (BE) procedure to assess the effects of OxR1 antagonism on demand for the highly abused opioid fentanyl. We also investigate the utility of our novel procedure in predicting OxR1 antagonism efficacy and relapse propensity. The OxR1 antagonist SB-334867 (SB) increased demand elasticity (α; decreased motivation) for fentanyl without affecting preferred consumption of fentanyl at null cost (Qo). Baseline α values predicted SB efficacy, such that SB was most effective at increasing demand elasticity in highly motivated rats. SB also attenuated cue-induced fentanyl seeking and baseline α values predicted the amount of reinstatement behavior. These results highlight the promise of the orexin system as a treatment target for opioid addiction and emphasize the usefulness of BE procedures in the study of opioid abuse.",1426,99,511,24.0

Here we investigate learning and memory differences in zebrafish (Danio rerio) displaying proactive and reactive stress coping styles. We assessed learning rate and memory duration using an associative fear conditioning paradigm that trained zebrafish to associate a context with exposure to a natural olfactory alarm cue. Our results show that both proactive and reactive zebrafish learn and remember this fearful association. However, we note significant interaction effects between stress coping style and cognition. Zebrafish with the reactive stress coping style acquired the fear memory at a significantly faster rate than proactive fish. While both stress coping styles showed equal memory recall one day post-training, reactive zebrafish showed significantly stronger recall of the conditioned context relative to proactive fish four days post-training. Through understanding how stress coping strategies promote biases in processing salient information, we gain insight into mechanisms that can constrain adaptive behavioral responses.",1341,67,376,29.0

However, the contextual, genetic and neural underpinnings of the emission of, and response to dSO, have received little attention. Using a binary choice assay, we determined that neither age and sex of emitters, nor the time of the day, affected the emission or avoidance of dSO. However, both sex and mating status affected the response to dSO.

Spiking responses of excitatory and inhibitory L2/3 neurons in mouse A1 revealed learning-induced overrepresentation of the learned frequencies, in accordance with previous literature. Using a novel computational model to study auditory tuning curves we show that overrepresentation does not necessarily improve discrimination performance of the network to the learned tones. In contrast, perceptual learning of natural sounds induced ‘sparsening’ and decorrelation of the neural response, and consequently improving discrimination of these complex sounds. The signature of plasticity in A1 highlights its central role in coding natural sounds as compared to pure tones.",3843,465,1829,53.0

Octopus are often viewed as solitary animals but O. laqueus live in close proximity in the wild, and will potentially encounter one another on a regular basis, raising the possibility of sociality in the species. To test for social tolerance and social repulsion in O. laqueus, animals were kept in communal tanks, and the number of dens and sex composition was varied per tank, with a set mixture of sizes and with den occupancy tracked per individual. We found that O. laqueus will socially tolerate other individuals by sharing tanks and dens, including several animals in contact and sharing a den under den-limited conditions, and with typically no loss to cannibalism or escape. However, animals also exhibit significant levels of social repulsion, and individuals often chose a solitary den when given the option. The patterns of den occupancy are observed to be consistent with a maximum entropy model. Overall, the preference to have a den is stronger than the preference to be solitary in O. laqueus, and the animals are socially tolerant of others in the tank and in a den or shelter, a first for octopuses outside mating. The relaxed disposition and social tolerance of O. laqueus make it a promising species to work with in lab, and for development into a genetic model for social behavior in octopuses.",1432,133,579,37.0

It is widely believed that AP is only for the selected few with rare genetic makeup and early musical training during the critical period. Accordingly, acquiring AP in adulthood is impossible. Previous studies have not offered a strong test of the effect of training because of issues like small sample size and insufficient training. In three experiments, adults learned to name pitches in a computerized and personalized protocol for 12 to 40 hours. They improved considerably, with a continuous distribution of learning progress among them. 14% of the participants (6 out of 43) were able to name twelve pitches at accuracy of 90% or above, comparable to that of ‘AP possessors’ as defined in the literature. In general, AP learning showed classic characteristics of perceptual learning, including generalization of learning dependent on the training stimuli, and sustained improvement for at least one to three months. Overall, the finding that AP continues to be learnable in adulthood calls for reconsidering the role of learning in the occurrence of AP. The finding also pushes the field to pinpoint and explain, if any, the differences between the aspects of AP more trainable in adulthood and the aspects of AP that are potentially exclusive for the few exceptional AP possessors.",26658,974,4324,66.0

Dougherty",530279;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/530279,"The Social Approach Task is commonly used to identify sociability deficits when modeling liability factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mice. It was developed to expand upon assays available to examine distinct aspects of social behavior in rodents and has become a standard component of mouse ASD-relevant phenotyping pipelines. However, there is variability in the statistical analysis and interpretation of results from this task. A common analytical approach is to conduct within-group comparisons only, and then interpret a difference in significance levels as if it were a group difference, without any direct comparison. As an efficient shorthand, we named this approach EWOCs: Erroneous Within-group Only Comparisons. Here we examined the prevalence of EWOCs and used simulations to test whether it could produce misleading inferences. Our review of Social Approach studies of high-confidence ASD genes revealed 45% of papers sampled used only this analytical approach. Through simulations, we then demonstrate how a lack of significant difference within one group often doesn’t correspond to a significant difference between groups, and show this erroneous interpretation increases the rate of false positives up to 25%. Finally, we define a simple solution: use an index, like a social preference score, with direct statistical comparisons between groups to identify significant differences. We also provide power calculations to guide sample size in future studies. Overall, elimination of EWOCs and adoption of direct comparisons should result in more accurate, reliable, and reproducible data interpretations from the Social Approach Task across ASD liability models.Lay Summary The Social Approach Task is widely used to assess social behavior in mice and is frequently used in studies modeling autism. However, reviewing published studies showed nearly half do not use correct comparisons to interpret the data. Using simulated and original data, we argue the correct statistical approach is a direct comparison of scores between groups.

Eco-evolutionary models integrate arms race or Red-Queen like dynamics. The roles of the predator and prey species are always assumed to be static. Nevertheless, sometimes predators can bite off more than they can chew. For example, predators that encounter multiple or dangerous prey types may need to develop new predatory tactics to capture prey. We explore the dynamics of predator-prey dynamics when the prey can injure or kill the predator. This common ecological scenario places pressure on the predator to develop novel predatory tactics to both capture prey and avoid counter-attack from prey. Taking a bottom-up approach, we develop the Holling function mechanistically and then implement it in a model of innovationselection dynamics inspired by economic theory. We show how an interdisciplinary approach can be used to explain the emergence of complex predatory behaviours. Notably, our study shows why predators may hunt dangerous prey even when safe prey are available. In a broader context, we demonstrate how a multidisciplinary approach combining ecology, evolution and economics improves our understanding of a complex behavioural trait.",1146,96,397,28.0

A computer-based experiment was developed where subjects were required to predict the future location of a spaceship that orbited around planet Earth. Its position was sampled from a Gaussian distribution with the mean changing at a variable velocity and four different values of variance that defined our signal-to-noise conditions. Three error-driven algorithms using a Bayesian approach were proposed as candidates to describe our data. The first is the standard delta-rule. The second and third models are delta rules incorporating a velocity component which is updated using prediction errors. The third model additionally assumes a hierarchical structure where individual learning rates for velocity and decision noise come from Gaussian distributions with means following a hyperbolic function. We used leave-one-out cross-validation and the Widely Applicable Information Criterion to compare the predictive accuracy of these models. In general, our results provided evidence in favor of the hierarchical model and highlight two main conclusions. First, when facing an environment that fluctuates from trial to trial, people can learn to estimate its velocity to make predictions. Second, learning rates for velocity and decision noise are influenced by uncertainty constraints represented by the signal-to-noise ratio. This higher order control was modeled using a hierarchical structure, which qualitatively accounts for individual variability and is able to generalize and make predictions about new subjects on each experimental condition.",2050,188,499,19.0

A number of biases have been identified in these estimates, which seem primarily rooted in the spatial organization of objects (grouping, symmetry, etc). Most previous studies on the number sense used static stimuli with extremely brief exposure times. However, outside the laboratory, visual scenes are often dynamic and freely viewed for prolonged durations (e.g., a flock of moving sheep). The purpose of the present study is to examine grouping-induced numerosity biases in stimuli that more closely mimic these conditions. To this end, we designed two experiments with limited-dot-lifetime displays (LDDs), in which each dot is visible for a brief period of time and replaced by a new dot elsewhere after its disappearance. The dynamic nature of LDDs prevents subjects from counting even when they are free-viewing a stimulus under prolonged presentation. Subjects estimated the number of dots in arrays that were presented either as a single group or were segregated into two groups by spatial clustering, dot size, dot color, or dot motion. Grouping by color and motion reduced perceived numerosity compared to viewing them as a single group. Moreover, the grouping effect sizes between these two features were correlated, which suggests that the effects may share a common, feature-invariant mechanism. Finally, we find that dot size and total stimulus area directly affect perceived numerosity, which makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about grouping effects induced by spatial clustering and dot size. Our results provide new insights into biases in numerosity estimation and they demonstrate that the use of LDDs is an effective method to study the human number sense under prolonged viewing.",929,179,257,31.0

Cooperative breeding primates (marmosets and tamarins; family: Callitrichidae) live in groups with moderate to high reproductive skew, particularly in females, whereby sexually mature individuals are frequently prevented from breeding. Remarkably, dispersal from natal groups is not stereotyped upon reaching reproductive maturity. Individuals are often observed remaining in their natal groups until the same-sex breeder in their group or a neighboring group dies, experiencing hormonal reproductive suppression, aggression, and limited access to potential mates. Here we examined whether emperor tamarins (Saguinus imperator) might use vocal signals to reduce dispersal risks and maximize the likelihood of attaining a breeding position. Using six consecutive years of mark-recapture data, we showed that sexually mature non-breeders (herein ""secondary breeders"") are more likely to leave their groups from one year to the next than sexually mature breeders (""primary breeders""). This confirmed that, unlike primary breeders who do not need to disperse in order to reproduce, secondary breeders are choosing to accept the risks associated with dispersal and emigrating from their natal groups. We used neural networks to classify vocalizations according to individual breeding status, and conducted a series of playback experiments which demonstrated that tamarins discriminated between the calls of primary and secondary breeders. Our data support the hypotheses that secondary breeders disperse to increase mating opportunities and use vocalizations to signal their availability to potential mates. This species of cooperative breeder appears to use vocalization to navigate its social and reproductive systems, minimizing risks of dispersal and in turn increasing the likelihood of reproductive success. This research has important implications for our understanding of sexual signaling, partner choice, and reproductive success in cooperative breeders.",963,140,393,

However, it is unclear which process is prioritized when both are required. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine this question using one of the world’s most destructive agricultural pests, the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. Transcripts from the ovaries and fat bodies of newly emerged locusts were analyzed, using RNA-seq based transcriptome and qualitative real-time PCR, at 4 h and 6 d after being infected with the gram-positive bacteria Microcroccus luteus, and changes in the main biological pathways involved in reproduction and immunization were analyzed using bioinformatics. At 4 h after infection, 348 and 133 transcripts were up- and down-regulated, respectively, whereas 5699 and 44 transcripts were up- and down-regulated, respectively, at 6 d after infection. Meanwhile, KEGG analysis indicated that vital pathways related with immunity and reproduction, such as Insulin resistance, FoxO signaling, Lysosome, mTOR signaling, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways were up-regulated. Among the differentially expressed genes, 22 and 17 were related to immunity and reproduction, respectively, and the expression levels of PPO1 and antimicrobial peptide defensin 3 were increased (log2FC = 5.93 and 6.75, respectively), whereas those of VgA and VgB were reduced (log2FC = −17.82 and −18.13, respectively). These results indicated that that locusts allocate energy and resources to maintain their own survival by increasing immune response when dealing with both immune and reproductive processes. The present study provides the first report of expression levels for genes related with reproduction and immunity in locusts, thereby providing a reference for future studies, as well as theoretical guidance for investigations of locust control.",898,124,278,36.0

In two large general population samples, we examined how symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD) predict choices in a socially framed reinforcement learning task, the Patent Race game. Using a computational learning model to assess learning strategy, we found that self-reported social anxiety was indeed associated with an increase in deliberative evaluation. The effect was specific to learning from a particular (“upward counterfactual”) subset of feedback, broadly matching the biased content of rumination in SAD. It was also robust to controlling for other psychiatric symptoms.

The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed. They also have implications for experimental design because fish housed in separate tanks cannot be assumed to be statistically independent if they can eavesdrop on their neighbours.",1145,445,997,26.0

James, Gary Aston-Jones",521633;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/521633,"The orexin (hypocretin) system is important for reward-seeking behavior. The orexin-1 receptor (Ox1R) antagonist SB334867 (SB) reduces seeking of food and drug reward under conditions of high motivation. There is some evidence that the effects of systemic SB on reward seeking persist beyond the pharmacological availability of the drug, however the time course of these effects is not well characterized, nor is it known whether similar persistent effects are observed following intraparenchymal injections. Here, we used a behavioral economics paradigm, which allows for repeated testing of drug motivation across consecutive days, to examine the persistent effects of acute systemic and local treatment with SB on motivation for the short-acting opioid remifentanil. Systemic injections of SB immediately prior to behavioral testing reduced motivation for remifentanil; this effect was sustained on a subsequent test at 24h, but not on a third test at 48h. When injected locally into caudal ventral pallidum (cVP) the effects of SB were more persistent, with reduced motivation observed for up to 48h. We next made SB injections into cVP 24h prior to behavioral testing; this produced persistent effects that persisted for at least 72h post-treatment. Cued reinstatement of extinguished remifentanil seeking was also attenuated by pretreatment with SB 24h prior. These data indicate that the effects of SB on opioid seeking behavior persist beyond the bioavailability of the compound. These observations might have important ramifications for the future clinical use of orexin receptor antagonists for the treatment of addiction.",956,125,479,28.0

Just as human friendships, social bonds are thought to function as alliances that generate adaptive benefits via support in critical situations. In humans, similarity in many sociodemographic, behavioural and intrapersonal characteristics leads to trust and is predictive of friendships. Specifically, personality homophily, that is the tendency of individuals to form social bonds with others who have a similar personality, may increase predictability and facilitate trust and reciprocity among partners with compatible behavioural tendencies. While evidence for social bonding in nonhumans is accumulating, far less is known about its predictors. Here, personality homophily effects on the formation and maintenance of social bonds are shown in twenty-four wild male Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis), at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Dyadic bond strength increased with increased similarity in the trait Connectedness (i.e. frequent and diverse neighbours in 5m proximity and pronounced social tolerance, as high rates of friendly approaches to and by others). To differentiate whether homophily indeed predicted bond formation or whether bonded males’ personalities became more similar over time, we tested the stability of the connectedness traits in a subset of immigrating males that had to form new bonds. Connectedness in these males remained stable suggesting that males do not adapt their personality to their partner. Our results support the idea of a shared evolutionary origin of homophily as a partner choice strategy in human and non-human animals. The main selective advantage of personality similarity in animal social bonds may result from a more reliable cooperation among individuals with similar cooperative behavioural tendencies.",1061,188,506,50.0

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences effect foraging performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of foraging performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of foraging performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging performance depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavior syndromes.",1330,201,535,19.0

In this study, we assessed whether zebrafish modified their spacing behavior and interaction time in an additive or multiplicative way relative to multiple sources of visual social information using video playbacks. We simultaneously manipulated: (a) the magnitude of the social cues (by varying the size of the virtual fish), (b) the level of social risk (low, high based on the position of the virtual fish in the water column), and (c) the perceived depth of the social cues (visual horizon absent or present). Each of these factors independently affected spacing behavior (zebrafish increased the separation distance with larger virtual fish, under lower visual social risk, and when depth perception was enhanced), but they did not affect interaction time. However, some of these factors interacted significantly, such that their effects on social behavior depended on each other. For instance, zebrafish decreased their separation distance under high vs. low risk conditions when the virtual fish was the same or smaller size, but this risk effect disappeared with larger virtual fish likely to avoid aggression. Also, zebrafish increased their separation distance when perceived depth was enhanced under low risk, but the perceived depth effect became less pronounced under high risk probably due to dilution effects. Overall, the effects of certain visual social parameters depend on the intensity of other visual social parameters, ultimately tuning up or down different social behavioral responses. We discuss the implications for the spatial organization of fish schools.Significance Statement Many fish form schools and visually track the position of their neighbors in a 3D environment. We found that zebrafish consider multiple visual social sources of information simultaneously to modify their neighbor distance. Thus, their spacing behavior appears to follow multiplicative rules, whereby the spacing response to a visual social parameter depend on the intensity of a different visual social parameter.",871,123,375,35.0

Recently, our laboratory showed that systemic blockade of Ox1Rs decreased motivation for the potent and short-acting opioid remifentanil, as well as remifentanil consumption at null cost (Porter-Stransky et al., 2017). However, the central site(s) through which orexin acts to regulate opioid-seeking behaviors are not known. We investigated ventral pallidum (VP) as a potential site of orexin action, as VP is a known mediator of opioid reward and is densely innervated by orexin-immunoreactive fibers. We used a within-session behavioral economics (BE) paradigm in which remifentanil price (responses/	μg iv remifentanil) was sequentially increased throughout the session. Rats were implanted with bilateral cannulae into caudal VP (cVP), through which microinjections of SB334867 (SB), an Ox1R antagonist, were given prior to BE and reinstatement testing. Contrary to systemic SB treatment, intra-cVP SB preferentially reduced motivation (increased demand elasticity and reinstatement) for reminfentanil, without affecting remifentanil consumption at null cost. These effects were specific to cVP, as control microinjections of SB immediately dorsal to cVP did not affect remifentanil-seeking. Baseline demand for remifentanil predicted cued reinstatement of remifentanil seeking and the efficacy with which intra-cVP SB administration reduced motivation for remifentanil.  These findings indicate a specific role for cVP Ox1R signaling in mediating the motivational properties of the opioid remifentanil, distinct from its consumption at null cost. Our findings also highlight the BE paradigm as an effective biomarker for predicting opioid addiction behaviors and treatment efficacy.",1577,202,478,

Similarly, general sexual selection theory predicts that mate competition should benefit individuals carrying “good genes” with beneficial pleiotropic effects on general cognitive ability. However, few experimental studies have evaluated these related hypotheses due to difficulties of performing direct tests in most taxa. Here we harnessed the empirical potential of the seed beetle study system to investigate the role of sexual selection and mating system in the evolution of cognition. We evolved replicate lines of beetle under enforced monogamy (eliminating sexual selection) or polygamy for 35 generations and then challenged them to locate and discriminate among mating partners (male assays) or host seeds (female assays). To assess learning, the same beetles performed the task in three consecutive rounds. All lines learned the task, improving both within and between trails. Moreover, polygamous males outperformed monogamous males. However, there were no differences in the rate of learning between males of the two regimes, and polygamous females showed no improvement in host search, and even signs of reduced learning. Hence, while sexual selection was a potent factor that increased cognitive performance in mate search, it did not lead to the general increase in cognitive abilities expected under the “mating mind” hypothesis or general “good genes” theory. Our results highlight sexually antagonistic (balancing) selection as a potential force maintaining genetic variation in cognitive traits.",1343,326,587,34.0

The mechanisms that link mental and physical health, and the degree to which these are shared across species, remain largely unknown. Here we show that the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has the capability to perceive dead conspecifics in its environment and that this perceptive experience induces both short- and long-term effects on health and longevity. Death perception is mediated by visual and olfactory cues, and remarkably, its effects on aging are eliminated by targeted attenuation of serotonin signaling.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether helpers increased the daily survival rate of nests during the incubation stage in the Southern Lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), a crested plover with a cooperative breeding system. Southern Lapwings have a variable mating system, with some breeding groups composed of unassisted pairs, and others that breed in the presence of helpers. Our best supported model indicated a positive effect of the presence of helpers on the daily survival rate of nests, leading to a probability of nest success (i.e., survival until hatching) of 83%, compared to 51% for nests of unassisted pairs.

Colour trapping is an established method for monitoring and controlling of Bradysia species. In order to clarify the effect of colour preference of B. odoriphaga for the egg-laying substrate, multiple-choice tests were employed to assess the spontaneous response of the chive gnat to different colour hues and brightness levels under different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations. Given the choice among four colours differing in hue under different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations, chive gnat adults visited preferably the black substrate, a lesser extent to brown and green substrates, and the least extent to orange substrate irrespective of illumination. Given the choice among four levels of brightness under the same illumination conditions as those in the previous experiment (different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations), chive gnats preferred black substrate over dark grey, and these over light grey and white substrates. Meanwhile, both virgin and copulated adults significantly preferred black over other colour hues and brightness. Based on our results, we conclude that the chive gnat adults significantly prefer black substrates irrespective of colour hues and brightness.

Communication consists of trains of 5 - 7 Hz taps in groups or trains separated by 2-3 sec intervals. Male beetles spontaneously produce groups of tap-trains with 8 - 18 taps per train. If other beetles reply, an alternating duet commences. Solitary female beetles do not tap spontaneously but respond to male tapping with short, distinctive tap-trains containing 4 – 6 taps; they ignore female signals. In contrast, extensive communication occurs between male beetles, the nature of which changes significantly if the stimulus call is typical of male or of female beetles. Inter-male communication consists of long tap-trains, but males interacting with females produce shorter tap-trains and engage in phonotactic behavior that is absent in inter-male communication. Females respond highly preferentially to inter-male communication, rather than to the signals produced spontaneously by single males. Finally, I propose a simple model of the selective advantages of this unusual communication system, and calculate its approximate energetic leverage over random locomotion (∼13x).",958,257,301,25.0

A common anti-predator behaviour are evasive manoeuvres to escape an attacking predator. The escape-tactic diversity hypothesis postulates that species-specific differences in evasive behaviour will increase the overall unpredictability experienced by predators within a predator-prey community. Evolutionary, escape-tactic diversity would be driven by the enhanced predator protection for each prey individual in the community. However, escape-tactic diversity could also be a functional consequence of morphological differences that correlate with evasive capabilities.Echolocating bats and eared moths are a textbook example of predator-prey interactions. Moths exhibit evasive flight with diverse tactics; however, the variability of their evasive flight within and between species has never been quantified systematically. In addition, moth species show variation in size, which correlates with their flight capability.We recorded flight strength during tethered flight of eight sympatric moth species in response to the same level of simulated bat predation. Our method allowed us to record kinematic parameters that are correlated with evasive flight in a controlled way to investigate species-specific differences in escape tactics.We show species-specific and size-independent differences in both overall flight strength and change of flight strength over time, confirming the escape-tactic diversity hypothesis for eared moths. Additionally, we show strong inter-individual differences in evasive flight within some species.

Many studies showed the existence of innate anti-predator responses mostly in early stages of juvenile’s vertebrate. Learning is also possible but risky since it can cause death. There is now growing evidence that embryonic learning exists in animals but few studies have tested explicitly for learning in embryos. Here, Sepia pharaonis cuttlefish embryos respond to the presence or odour of a predator fish but not to a non-predator fish. Interestingly, embryos can learn to associate a non-threatening stimulus with an alarm signal: cuttlefish ink. After several paired exposures, they respond to the harmless fish as if it were dangerous. Our results demonstrate both innate and acquired predator recognition in a cephalopod. Embryos response is a decrease of ventilation rate. Such response is adaptive, especially in a translucent egg, since it reduces movement and hence the risk of being detected; this freezing-like behaviour may also reduce bioelectric field, which lessens shark predation risk. Last, our result is the first report of associative learning in an invertebrate embryo. This shows that a cuttlefish embryo can have both genetic predator avoidance skills and possesses enough cognitive abilities plasticity to learn and retain new threats before hatching. The combination of these mechanisms is an impressive example of the early adaptability of cephalopod molluscs. This amount of behavioural plasticity gives the newly-hatched sepia a huge selective advantage when dealing with known or new threats.",1566,260,955,23.0

However, studies across diverse taxa have found that the relationship between glucocorticoid levels and fitness is not consistent: some studies show a positive relationship, others negative, and some show no correlation. Hence, support for the hypothesis is not consistent and thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between glucocorticoid levels, environmental pressures, and fitness is needed.

The succession of strophe types in song sessions betrayed a mixture of relatively predictable cycles and chaotic connections. The former should facilitate repeated retrieval of a considerable part of the repertoire, while the chaotic component keeps the whole repertoire readily accessible from any point in a singing session. The same mixture may be considered optimal for binding the attention of conspecific listeners.

Anthony",505263;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/505263,"SUMMARYAnimals exhibit distinct patterns of defensive behavior according to their perceived imminence of potential threats. Ethoexperimental [1, 2] and aversive conditioning [3-5] studies indicate that as the probability of directly encountering a threat increases, animals shift from behaviors aimed at avoiding detection (e.g. freezing) to escape (e.g. undirected flight). What are the neural mechanisms responsible for assessing threat imminence and controlling appropriate behavioral responses? Fundamental to addressing these questions has been the development of behavioral paradigms in mice in which well-defined threat-associated sensory stimuli reliably and robustly elicit passive or active defensive responses [6, 7]. In serial compound stimulus (SCS) fear conditioning, repeated pairing of sequentially presented tone (CS1) and white noise (CS2) auditory stimuli with footshock (US) yields learned freezing and flight responses to CS1 and CS2, respectively [6]. Although this white noise-induced transition from freezing to flight would appear to reflect increased perceived imminence due to the US being more temporally proximal to CS2 than CS1, this model has not been directly tested. Surprisingly, we find that audio frequency properties and sound pressure levels, not temporal relationship to the US, determine the defensive behaviors elicited by SCS conditioned auditory stimuli. Notably, auditory threat stimuli that most potently elicit high imminence behaviors include frequencies to which mouse hearing is most sensitive. These results argue that, as with visual threats [8], perceived imminence and resulting intensity of defensive responses scale with the salience of auditory threat stimuli.",1313,152,628,25.0

Here we report that deep attention networks can obtain in a data-driven way a model of collective behavior that is simultaneously predictive and insightful thanks to an organization in modules. The model obtains that interactions between two zebrafish, Danio rerio, in a large groups of 60-100, can be approximately be described as repulsive, attractive or as alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond only to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. The model also shows that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbours. Weights are higher for neighbours that are close, in a collision path or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. These weights effectively select 5 relevant neighbours on average, but this number is dynamical, changing between a single neighbour to up to 12, often in less than a second. Our results suggest that each animal in a group decides by dynamically selecting information from the group.HighlightsAt 30 days postfertilization, zebrafish, Danio rerio, can move in very cohesive and predictable large groupsDeep attention networks obtain a predictive and understadable model of collective motionWhen moving slowly, interations between pairs of zebrafish have clear components of repulsion, attraction and alignmentWhen moving fast, interactions correspond to alignment and a mixture of alignment and repulsion at close distancesZebrafish turn left or right depending on a weighted average of interaction information with other fish, with weights higher for close fish, those in a collision path or those moving fast in front or to the sidesAggregation is dynamical, oscillating between 1 and 12 neighbouring fish, with 5 on average",2635,318,1158,29.0

This can be achieved using several cues, including binocular stereoscopic cues such as changing disparity and interocular velocity differences and monocular cues such as looming. While these have been studied in detail in humans, only looming responses have been well characterized in insects and we know nothing about the role that stereo cues play and how they might interact with looming cues. We used our 3D insect cinema in a series of experiments to investigate the role of the stereo cues mentioned above, as well as looming, in the perception of motion-in-depth during predatory strikes by the praying mantis. Our results show that motion-in-depth does increase the probability of mantis strikes but only for the classic looming stimulus, an expanding luminance edge. Approach indicated by radial motion of a texture or expansion of a motion-defined edge, or by stereoscopic cues, all failed to elicit increased striking. We conclude that mantises use stereopsis to detect depth but not motion-in-depth, which is detected via looming.Summary Statement Both stereoscopic visual cues and changing luminance cues can enable detection of approaching objects. We show that mantises use looming rather than stereo cues to detect motion-in-depth.",829,183,321,37.0

Bornstein, Catherine A. Hartley",499707;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/499707,"Humans and animals consistently forego, or “discount” future rewards in favor of more proximal, but less valuable, options. This behavior is often thought of in terms of a failure of “self-control”, a lack of inhibition when considering the possibility of immediate gratification. However, rather than overweighting the near-term reward, the same behavior can result from failing to properly consider the far-off reward. The capacity to plan for future gains is a core construct in Reinforcement Learning (RL), known as “model-based” planning. Both discounting and model-based planning have been shown to track everyday behaviors from diet to exercise habits to drug abuse. Here, we show that these two capacities are related via a common mechanism – people who are more likely to deliberate about future reward in an intertemporal choice task, as indicated by the time they spend considering the choice, are also more likely to make multi-step plans for reward in a sequential reinforcement learning task. In contrast, the degree to which people’s intertemporal choices were driven by a more automatic bias did not correspond to their planning tendency, and neither did the more standard measure of discounting behavior. These results suggest that the standard behavioral economic measure of discounting is more fruitfully understood by decomposing it into constituent parts, and that only one of these parts corresponds to the sort of multi-step thinking needed to make plans for the future.",1603,181,785,17.0

Nevertheless, some animals can give up sleep in order to increase survival or mating opportunities. We studied the interplay between sleep and brood care in the social bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We first used video recording and detailed behavioral analyses to confirm that the bumblebee shows the essential behavioral characteristics of sleep. Based on these analyses we next used immobility bouts of &gt;5′ as proxy for sleep in automatic activity monitoring records, and found that sleep is severely reduced in the presence of larvae that require feeding or pupae that are not fed. Reduced sleep was correlated with wax pot building, which is a behavior typical to nest founding mother queens. Sleep was also reduced in the presence of empty cocoons, but this effect was transient and reduced with time. This observation that is consistent with the presence of a sleep modulating pheromonal signal. These results provide the first evidence for brood modulation of sleep in an insect, and are consistent with the hypothesis that plasticity in sleep can evolve as a mechanism to improve care for dependent juveniles.",1090,126,347,25.0

The question addressed here is the extent to which these three ‘vulnerability factors’ are related; that is, predictive of one another. Some relationships have been reported in small samples, but here a large sample of 1,598 outbred male and female heterogeneous stock rats were screened for Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior (to obtain an index of incentive salience attribution; ‘sign-tracking’), and subsequently tested for sensation-seeking and novelty-seeking. Despite the large N there were no significant correlations between these traits, in either males or females. There were, however, novel relationships between multiple measures of incentive salience attribution and, based on these findings, we generated a new metric that captures “incentive value”.

In particular, the Double Error Dynamic Asymptote (DDA) model introduces: 1) a fully-connected network architecture in which stimuli are represented as temporally clustered elements that associate to each other, so that elements of one cluster engender activity on other clusters, which naturally implements neutral stimuli associations and mediated learning; 2) a predictor error term within the traditional error correction rule (the double error), which reduces the rate of learning for expected predictors; 3) a revaluation associability rate that operates on the assumption that the outcome predictiveness is tracked over time so that prolonged uncertainty is learned, reducing the levels of attention to initially surprising outcomes; and critically 4) a biologically plausible variable asymptote, which encapsulates the principle of Hebbian learning, leading to stronger associations for similar levels of cluster activity. The outputs of a set of simulations of the DDA model are presented along with empirical results from the literature. Finally, the predictive scope of the model is discussed.",5609,672,1798,142.0

Sheehan, C. S. De Freitas, M. W. Howard",338962;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/338962,"There is widespread agreement that episodic memory is organized into a timeline of past experiences. Recent work suggests that the hippocampus may parse the flow of experience into discrete episodes separated by event boundaries. A complementary body of work suggests that context changes gradually as experience unfolds. We recorded from hippocampal neurons as male long evans rats performed 6 blocks of an object discrimination task in sets of 15 trials. Each block was separated by removal from the testing chamber for a delay to enable segmentation. The reward contingency reversed from one block to the next to incentivize segmentation. We expected animals to hold two distinct, recurring representations of context to match the two distinct rule contingencies. Instead, we found that overtrained rats began each block neither above nor below chance but by guessing randomly. While many units had clear firing fields selective to the conjunction of objects in places, a significant population also reflected a continuously drifting code both within block and across blocks. Despite clear boundaries between blocks, we saw no neural evidence for event segmentation in this experiment. Rather, the hippocampal ensemble drifted continuously across time. This continuous drift in the neural representation was consistent with the lack of segmentation observed in behavior.Significance Statement The neuroscience literature yet to reach consensus as to how hippocampal firing fields support the organizing of events across time in episodic memory. Initial reports of hippocampal activity focused on discrete episodes within which representations were stable, and across which representations remapped. However, it remains unclear whether this segmentation of representations is merely an artifact of cue responsivity. More recently, research has shown that a proportion of the population codes for temporal aspects of context by exhibiting varying degrees of drift in their firing fields. Drift is hypothesized to represent a continually evolving temporal context, however it is unclear whether this drift is continuous or is also a mere artifact of changing experiences. We recorded from the dorsal hippocampus of rats performing an object discrimination task that involved contexts that were segmented in time. Overtrained rats were unable to anticipate the identity of the upcoming context, but may have used context boundaries to their advantage. Event segmentation theory predicts that hippocampal ensembles would alternate between behaviorally-relevant segments. Contrary to these predictions, animals showed weak evidence of context segmentation, even across blocks with different reward contingencies. Hippocampal ensembles showed neither evidence of alternating between stable contexts nor sensitivity to context boundaries, but did show robust temporal drift.",1648,220,654,70.0

Workers and soldiers readily perform a lateral or longitudinal shaking behavior upon antennal contact with queens and kings. When royal cuticular chemicals are transferred to live workers or inert glass dummies, they elicit antennation and shaking in a dose-dependent manner. The striking response to reproductives and their cuticular extracts suggests that royal-specific cuticular compounds act as recognition pheromones and that shaking behavior is a clear and measurable queen and king recognition response in this termite species.",758,319,230,39.0

During in vitro study, SH showed better fermentation characteristics (including greater maximum gas production, shorter time to achieve half of Vf, greater concentrations of acetate, propionate and total VFA, and less initial fractional rate of degradation) than other four substrates, while WB had the greatest values of DM and NDF disappearance, NH3-N and butyrate concentrations among substrates.

Walker, Graham K. Taylor, Steven J.

Flock dynamics therefore have significant implications for energy expenditure. Despite this, no studies have quantified the biomechanical consequences of flying in a cluster flock relative to flying solo. Here, we compared the flight characteristics of homing pigeons (Columba livia) flying solo and in pairs, using high-precision 5 Hz GPS and 200 Hz tri-axial accelerometer biologgers. Paired flight increased route accuracy by ~7%, but, was accompanied by an increase in wingbeat frequency of ~18%. As expected, paired individuals benefitted from improved homing route accuracy, which reduced flight distance by ~7% and time by ~9%. However, realising these navigational gains involved substantial changes in flight kinematics and energetics. Both individuals in a pair increased their wingbeat frequency by c.18%, by decreasing the duration of their upstroke. This sharp increase in wingbeat frequency caused just a 3% increase in airspeed, but reduced the oscillatory displacement of the body by ~22%, which we hypothesise relates to an increased requirement for visual stability and manoeuvrability when flocking. Overall, the shorter flight distances and increased wingbeat frequency in a pair resulted in a net increase in the aerodynamic cost of returning home, which we estimate was ~14%. Our results demonstrate that flocking costs have been underestimated by an order of magnitude and force reinterpretation of their mechanistic origin. We show that, for pigeons, two heads are better than one, but keeping a steady head necessitates energetically costly kinematics.",731,113,337,35.0

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of fasting caecotrophy on growth performance and lipid metabolism in rabbits.Results Our results indicated that, compared with the control group, the final body weight, weight gain, liver weight, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio were all decreased in the experimental group (P&lt;0.05). Oil red staining of the liver tissue indicated that fasting caecotrophy resulted in decrease of lipid droplet accumulation.

Predation on herbivores is known to vary with the size of the area covered in vegetation, successional stage, altitude, and the structure of the predator community, but there are gaps in information regarding how this occurs in urban and suburban environments. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the predation pressure on artificial models of lepidopteran larvae varied with degree of urbanization, type of substrate, and group of predators (birds or arthropods) in Cali, Colombia. Five hundred and eighteen artificial larvae were placed in two areas of the city (urban vs. suburban) and in two types of substrate (leaf vs. stem) for 30 continuous days and with two replications over time. Total predation was measured as the number of models with evidence of attack by predators. The overall incidence of predation was 24.13%, and was significantly higher in the urban area (63.20%) when compared to the suburban area (36.80%). The leaf substrate was attacked significantly more than the stem (60% vs. 40%). The proportion of attacks carried out by birds was significantly higher (74.40%) than that carried out by arthropods (24.80%). Together, these results suggest that the incidence of predation varies with the disturbance caused by urbanization and by the type of substrate in which prey organisms are found.

Both scales have been used to assess pain in a laparotomy model, however, they have never been compared directly and the knowledge of how different analgesics may affect these two scales is limited. This study aimed to provide a comparison to discriminate the temporal and analgesic response in a laparotomy model. Female Wistar (n = 26) and Sprague Dawley rats (n = 26) were block randomized to receive saline, meloxicam (2 mg/kg) or buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) 30 minutes before a laparotomy model. Rats were video-recorded before surgery (BL) and at 30, 150, 270, and 390 minutes post-operatively. Videos were assessed according to both scales by a trained, blinded observer. Both CBS and RGS scores increased significantly at all post surgical timepoints in the saline group. Post-surgical CBS scores did not increase significantly above baseline levels in the groups given meloxicam or buprenorphine. However, the RGS scores only remained low in the buprenorphine group while scores increased significantly in the meloxicam group, to a similar degree as in the saline group. These findings suggest that the CBS is more sensitive to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs than the RGS.",1165,155,446,21.0

Data and samples were obtained from a total of 33 animals and their respective carcasses. Fragments of the extensor carpi radialis muscle were extracted from all the carcasses to analyze the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and- samples of the Longissimus dorsi muscle to perform the 24h post-mortem pH, colorimetric test, cooking loss and drip loss assessment and to measure the shear force. The presence of hematomas was detected in 28 carcasses, where the tail and croup (17/33) and flank (17/33) regions were the most affected. The electron paramagnetic resonance indicated an average of 52.59 ROS/g in the analyzed pieces. The meat quality tests indicated averages of: 5.8 for the 24h postmortem pH, L*29.34, a* 2.52 and b* 1.31 in calorimetry, 2.30 kg/f for the shearing force, 11.75% of cooking losses and 1.88% of drip losses.

Female black widow spiders, in particular, have a striking body-form; their long thin legs support a large pendulous abdomen. Here, we show that in their natural posture, the large abdominal mass of black widow females, interacts with the spring-like behaviour of their leg joints and determines the mechanical behaviour of different leg joints. Furthermore, we find that adopting different body postures enables females to alter both the level and tuning of the mechanical input to lyriform organs. Therefore, we suggest that posture may be used to flexibly and reversibly focus attention to different classes or components of web vibration. Postural effects thus emphasize the dynamic loop of interactions between behaviour and perception, i.e. between ‘brain’ and body.",3105,244,874,27.0

Except for their feeding specialization, these insects share this cycle of activities with many gregarious arthropod species. The understanding of how sex and T. cruzi infection affect their aggregation and geotaxis behavior is essential for understanding the spatial organization of the insects and the parasite dispersion. Experiments with non-infected and infected adults of T. infestans show that the insects presented a high negative geotaxis and aggregative behavior. Males had a higher negative geotaxis and a higher aggregation level than females. The aggregation level and the negative geotaxis were stronger in infected insects than in non-infected ones, the difference between sexes being maintained. The importance of these results is discussed in term of parasitic manipulation, dispersion of the vector and strategy of its monitoring.",1141,210,410,24.0

Jerome Beetz, Manfred Kössl, Julio C. Hechavarría",485490;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/485490,"Summary statement When echolocating under demanding conditions e.g. noisy, narrow space, or cluttered environments, frugivorous bats adapt their call pattern by increasing the call rate within biosonar groups. For orientation, echolocating bats emit biosonar calls and use echoes arising from call reflections. They often pattern their calls into groups which increases the rate of sensory feedback over time. Insectivorous bats emit call groups at a higher rate when orienting in cluttered compared to uncluttered environments. Frugivorous bats increase the rate of call group emission when they echolocate in noisy environments. Here, calls emitted by conspecifics potentially interfere with the bat’s biosonar signals and complicate the echolocation behavior. To minimize the information loss followed by signal interference, bats may profit from a temporally increased sensory acquisition rate, as it is the case for the call groups. In frugivorous bats, it remains unclear if call group emission represents an exclusive adaptation to avoid interference by signals from other bats or if it represents an adaptation that allows to orient under demanding environmental conditions. Here, we compared the emission pattern of the frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata when the bats were flying in noisy versus silent, narrow versus wide or cluttered versus non-cluttered corridors. According to our results, the bats emitted larger call groups and they increased the call rate within the call groups when navigating in narrow, cluttered, or noisy environments. Thus, call group emission represents an adaptive behavior when the bats orient in complex environments.",558,126,192,18.0

In this study, we evaluated if foraging efficiency can be improved by short term training. Over a period of 14 d, we kept individuals of the training group in a raceway and fed them chironomids buried in a small sand spot to stimulate benthic feeding behavior while fish of the control group were fed in tanks without substrate. Thereafter, each fish was transferred to a raceway entirely covered with sand. For feeding, chironomids were randomly buried in the sand. During the first 7 days, trained fish recovered the feed significantly faster than untrained fish of the control group. Gene expression revealed an up-regulation in neurod1 in all brain regions after 14 d of training. Thus, this study suggests that foraging efficiency can be improved through short-time training thus improve fitness upon restocking into the wild.Table of Abbreviationsd-daysTL-total length",511,103,264,24.0

It has been suggested that such pupil shapes may camouflage the eye; yet, no experimental evidence has been presented to support this claim. Skates are bottom-dwellers that often bury into the substrate with their eyes protruding. If these pupils serve any camouflage function, we expect there to be a pupillary response related to the spatial frequency (“graininess”) of the background against which the eye is viewed. Here, we tested whether skate pupils dilate or constrict in response to background spatial frequency. We placed skates on background substrates with different spatial frequencies and recorded pupillary responses at three light intensities. In experiment 1, the skates’ pupillary response to three artificial checkerboards of different spatial frequencies was recorded. Skates responded to changing light intensity with pupil dilation/constriction; yet, their pupils did not change in response to spatial frequency. In experiment 2, in which skates could bury into three natural substrates with different spatial frequencies, such that their eyes protruded above the substrate, the pupils showed a subtle but statistically significant response to changes in substrate spatial frequency. Given the same light intensity, the smaller the spatial frequency of the natural substrate, the more constricted the pupil. While light intensity is the primary factor determining pupil dilation, these experiments are the first to show that pupils also change in response to background spatial frequency, which suggests that the pupil may aid in camouflaging the eye.",8626,246,317,27.0

Predation is hence a major source of mortality in newly stocked individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate if naïve Baltic sturgeon juveniles were able to smell and recognize a common predator, sander (Sander lucioperca). Over a period of 30 days, three tanks from each group of Baltic sturgeon were attached to a rearing tank with sander (sander unit) and, as a control, carp (carp unit). Morphology of the dorsal scutes, distribution within the tank, stress (glucose, lactate and cortisol) and gene expression of brain plasticity and cognition were studied in comparison to the control group (carp unit).

Here, we investigate the evolutionary determinants of infanticide by females by combining a quantitative analysis of the taxonomic distribution of infanticide with a qualitative synthesis of the circumstances of infanticidal attacks in published reports. Our results show that female infanticide is widespread across mammals and varies in relation to social organization and life-history, being more frequent where females breed in groups and have intense bouts of high reproductive output. Specifically, female infanticide occurs where the proximity of conspecific offspring directly threatens the killer’s reproductive success by limiting access to critical resources for her dependent progeny, including food, shelters, care or a social position. In contrast, infanticide is not immediately modulated by the degree of kinship among females, and females occasionally sacrifice closely related juveniles. Our findings suggest that the potential direct fitness rewards of gaining access to reproductive resources have a stronger influence on the expression of female aggression than the indirect fitness costs of competing against kin.",2730,1893,2656,76.0

An effect of lunar phase on the degree of polarization of skylight was found, with smaller illuminated fractions of the moon’s surface corresponding to lower degrees of polarization in the night sky.

Borger, Reto Huber, Arko Ghosh",479014;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/479014,"Body movements drop with sleep and this behavioural signature is widely exploited to infer sleep duration. However, a reduction in body movements may also occur in periods of intense cognitive activity and the ubiquitous use of smartphones may capture these wakeful periods otherwise hidden in the standard measures of sleep. Here we continuously captured the gross body movements using standard wrist-worn accelerometers to quantify sleep (actigraphy) and logged the timing of the day-to-day touchscreen events (‘tappigraphy’). Using these measures, we addressed how the gross body movements overlap with the cognitively engaging digital behaviour (from n = 84 individuals, accumulating 1384 nights). We find that smartphone use was distributed across a broad spectrum of physical activity levels but consistently peaked at rest. We estimated the putative sleep onset and wake-up times from the actigraphy data to find that these times were well correlated to the estimates from tappigraphy (R2 = 0.9 for sleep onset and wake-up time). However, actigraphy overestimated sleep as virtually all of the users used their phones during the putative sleep period. Interestingly, the probability of touches remained greater than zero for ~ 2 h after the putative sleep onset and ~ 2 h before the putative wake-up time. Our findings suggest that touchscreen interactions are widely integrated into modern sleeping habits – surrounding both sleep onset and waking-up periods – yielding a new approach to measuring sleep. Smartphone taps can be leveraged to update the behavioural signatures of sleep with these peculiarities of modern digital behaviour.Author contributionsAG and RH designed the study.

Different behavioral expressions are reflective of different coping strategies of individuals in stressful situations. A causal link between behavioral responses and the activation of the physiological stress response is assumed but not thoroughly studied. Also, most standard paradigms investigating individual behavioral differences, are framed in a fearful context, therefore the present study aimed to add a test in a more positive context, the feeding context. We assessed individual differences in physiological (heart rate, HR) and behavioral responses (presence or absence of pawing, startle response, defecation, snorting) of twenty domestic horses (Equus caballus) in two behavioral experiments, a novel object presentation and a pre-feeding excitement test. Experiments were conducted twice, in summer and autumn. Both experiments caused higher mean HR in the first ten seconds after stimulus presentation compared to a control condition, but mean HR did not differ between the experimental conditions. Interestingly, in the novel object experiment, horses displaying stress-related behaviors during the experiments also showed a significantly higher HR increase compared to horses which did not display any stress-related behaviors, reflecting a correlation between behavioral and physiological responses to the novel object. On the contrary, in the pre-feeding experiments, horses that showed fewer behavioral responses had a greater HR increase, indicating the physiological response being due to emotional arousal and not behavioral activity. Moreover, HR response to experimental situations varied significantly between individuals, and although we found HR to be significantly repeatable across experiments, repeatability indices were low. In conclusion, our findings show that horses’ behavioral and physiological responses differed between test situations and that high emotional reactivity, shown via mean HR and HR increase, is not always displayed behaviorally.",741,269,382,31.0

We argue that these results were driven by sex-dependent mechanisms of social association: Markov chain-based fission-fusion modeling revealed that males reduced sociality when females were absent, while less social individuals found fewer patches. Females were similarly social with or without males. Finally, males, but not females, preferred to join females over males at patches.

Stephan, Jakob Heinzle",313643;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/313643,"An integral aspect of human cognition is the ability to inhibit habitual responses in order to initiate complex, rule-guided actions. Moreover, humans have also the ability to alternate between different sets of rules or tasks, at the cost of degraded performance when compared to repeating the same task, a phenomenon called the ‘task switch cost’. While it is recognized that switching between tasks requires often to inhibit habitual responses, the interaction between these two forms of cognitive control has been much less studied than each of them separately. Here, we use a computational model to draw a bridge between inhibitory control and voluntary action generation and thereby provide a novel account of seemingly paradoxical findings in the task switch literature. We investigated task switching in the mixed antisaccade task, in which participants are cued to saccade either in the same or in the opposite direction to a peripheral stimulus. Our model demonstrates that stopping a habitual action leads to increased inhibitory control that persists on the next trial. However, enhanced inhibition affects only the probability of generating habitual responses, and, contrary to previous accounts, cannot be characterized as proactive task interference. In addition, our model demonstrates that voluntary actions (but not habitual responses) are slower and more prompt to errors on switch trials compared to repeat trials. We conclude that precisely the interaction between these two effects explains a variety of contradictory findings reported in the literature.",1294,354,408,44.0

We show that the olfactory system on each side of the bee can learn and retrieve independently and the retrieval using the antenna on the side contralateral to the trained one is not affected by the training.

Bee does not learn the odor stimuli applied to one side alone as a stimulus different from odor presented to both sides. Moreover the behaviour of the bee as a whole can be predicted if the sides are assumed to learn and store independently and the organism as a whole is able to retrieve the memory if either of the sides have learned.Summary Statement The two halves of honeybee brain store and retrieve olfactory associative memories independently.",699,369,257,25.0

Fisher, Rolando Rodríguez-Muñoz, Tom Tregenza",475087;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/475087,"Reproductive success is often highly skewed in animal populations. Yet the processes leading to this are not always clear. Similarly, connections in animal social networks are often non-randomly distributed, with some individuals with many connections and others with few, yet whether there are simple explanations for this pattern has not been determined. Numerous social interactions involve dyads embedded within a wider network. As a result, it may be possible to model which individuals accumulate social interaction through a more general understanding of the social network’s structure, and how this structure changes over time. We analysed fighting and mating interactions across the breeding season in a population of wild field crickets under surveillance from a network of video cameras. We fitted stochastic actor-oriented models to determine the dynamic process by which networks of cricket fighting and mating interactions form, and how they co-influence each other. We found crickets tended to fight those in close spatial proximity to them, and those possessing a mutual connection in the fighting network, and heavier crickets fought more often. We also found that crickets who mate with many others tended to fight less in the following time period. This demonstrates that a mixture of spatial constraints, characteristics of individuals and characteristics of the immediate social environment are key for determining social interactions. The mating interaction network required very few parameters to understand its growth and so structure; only homophily by mating success was required to simulate the skew of mating interactions seen in this population. This demonstrates that relatively simple, but dynamic processes can give highly skewed distributions of mating success.",943,155,303,23.0

Theory predicts that, all else being equal, reliance on a particular information source will depend on its information content relative to other sources. Information conflicts are a good area in which to test such predictions. Social insects, such as ants, make extensive use of both private information (e.g. visual route memories) and social information (e.g. pheromone trails) when attempting to locate a food source. Importantly, eusocial insects collaborate on food retrieval, so both information use and information provision may be expected to vary with the information content of alternative information sources. Many ants, such as Lasius niger, are active both day and night. Variation in light levels represents an ecologically important change in the information content of visually-acquired route information. Here, we examine information use and information provision under high light levels (3200 lux), moderate light levels simulating dusk (10 lux) and darkness (0.007 lux). Ants fail to learn the location of a food source in darkness. As light levels decrease, ants show decreasing reliance on private visual information, and increasing pheromone trail following, consistent with a ‘copy when uncertain’ strategy. In moderate light levels and darkness, pheromone deposition increases, presumably to compensate for the low information content of visual information. Varying light levels for cathemeral animals provides a powerful and ecologically meaningful method for examining information use and provision under varying levels of information content.",838,277,255,18.0

Beckwith, Anna-Lena Horsch",219980;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/219980,"Animals have access to many alternative information sources when making decisions, such as private information (e.g. memory) and social information. Social insects make extensive use of social information. However, when intentional social information (e.g. pheromone trails in ants) conflicts with private information (e.g. route memories), insects often follow their private information. Why is this? We propose that an asymmetry in the type of information provided by these two information sources drives the neglect of social information: In ants, workers with certain information about the quality of a food source (memory) ignore valuable social information (pheromone trails) because the pheromone trails encode only a very ambiguous measure of food quality. This leads to a testable hypothesis: the addition of unambiguous quality information should rescue social information following. To test this, we trained ants to a poor quality (0.25M sucrose) food source, and then provided an alternative path along with either 1) no information, 2) a pheromone trail, 3) a 0.2μl 1.5M sucrose droplet, providing unambiguous quality information, or 4) both a trail and a droplet. When either no or only one information source was provided (1-3), most ants (60-75%) continued following their own memory. However, the addition of unambiguous quality information (4) rescued trail following: when both a trail and a droplet were provided, 75% of ants followed the trail. In further experiments, we show that quality information gleaned from direct contact with fed nestmates produced similar effects. Using florescence microscopy, we demonstrate that food (and information) flows from fed workers to outgoing foragers, explaining the frequent contacts on trails. We propose that the type of information an information source can convey, and its ambiguity, is a strong driver of which source of information is attended to.",1786,332,534,20.0

Here we show that this apparent conflict is regulated by the social learning strategies deployed. We examined the patterns of human social learning through an interactive online experiment with 699 participants, varying both task uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical Bayesian model-ftting to identify the individual learning strategies exhibited by participants. Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity amongst individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of herding amongst large groups confronted with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social learning of small groups, and the greater probability that social information would be accurate for less-challenging tasks, generated ‘wisdom of the crowd’ effects in other circumstances. Our model-based approach provides evidence that the likelihood of collective intelligence versus herding can be predicted, resolving a longstanding puzzle in the literature.",3024,327,1927,50.0

Seth, Warrick Roseboom",467027;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/467027,"Perception can be understood as an active process in which sensory samples are combined with prior expectations to shape perceptual content. A prominent example of the influence of priors on perception is that manually reproduced temporal durations are biased towards the mean of previously experienced durations. However, little is known about how prior expectations are acquired and maintained in environments in which multiple competing cues may indicate whether a given prior should be applied in that specific context. We tested whether human participants could acquire and maintain multiple priors for duration, dependent on the sensory signal in which the duration was presented. Human participants were presented with visual flashes or auditory tones, high or low pitch tones, or white noise versus pure tone audio. In each case, the presented duration on a given trial was drawn from a distribution that was, on average, shorter for tones than for flashes, or vice versa. Our participants’ timing reports were consistent with having acquired distinct duration priors dependent on the sensory signal in which the duration was presented (e.g. auditory or visual). Moreover, this was true whether signals differed across, or within, sensory modality. We account for our findings within a Bayesian framework in which duration priors are iteratively updated depending on determination of a common or distinct origin between successive events. Overall, these results show that the human brain can acquire and maintain multiple perceptual priors based on differences in stimulus properties both within and across the senses.",1697,313,717,39.0

In some cases, these changes may increase offspring fitness but, in others, they can elevate parental fitness at a cost to the fitness of their offspring. We show that in Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), the circulating glucocorticoid (GC) hormones of pregnant females affect the growth and cooperative behaviour of their offspring. We performed a 3-year experiment in wild meerkats to test the hypothesis that GC-mediated maternal effects reduce the potential for offspring to reproduce directly and therefore cause them to exhibit more cooperative behaviour. Daughters (but not sons) born to mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy grew more slowly early in life and exhibited significantly more of two types of cooperative behaviour (pup rearing and feeding) once they were adults compared to offspring from control mothers. They also had lower measures of GCs as they aged, which could explain the observed increases in cooperative behaviour. Because early life growth is a crucial determinant of fitness in female meerkats, our results indicate that GC-mediated maternal effects may reduce the fitness of offspring, but may elevate parental fitness as a consequence of increasing the cooperative behaviour of their daughters.",2633,462,892,45.0

Vágvölgyi, Eric S. Fortune, Noah J. Cowan",366609;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/366609,"SummaryActive sensing involves the production of motor signals for the purpose of acquiring sensory information [1–3]. The most common form of active sensing, found across animal taxa and behaviors, involves the generation of movements—e.g. whisking [4–6], touching [7,8], sniffing [9,10], and eye movements [11]. Active-sensing movements profoundly affect the information carried by sensory feedback pathways [12–15] and are modulated by both top-down goals (e.g. measuring weight vs. texture [1,16]) and bottom-up stimuli (e.g. lights on/off [12]) but it remains unclear if and how these movements are controlled in relation to the ongoing feedback they generate. To investigate the control of movements for active sensing, we created an experimental apparatus for freely swimming weakly electric fish, Eigenmannia virescens, that modulates the gain of reafferent feedback by adjusting the position of a refuge based on real time videographic measurements of fish position. We discovered that fish robustly regulate sensory slip via closed-loop control of active-sensing movements. Specifically, as fish performed the task of maintaining position inside the refuge [17–22], they dramatically up- or down-regulated fore-aft active-sensing movements in relation to a 4-fold change of experimentally modulated reafferent gain. These changes in swimming movements served to maintain a constant magnitude of sensory slip. The magnitude of sensory slip depended on the presence or absence of visual cues. These results indicate that fish use two controllers: one that controls the acquisition of information by regulating feedback from active sensing movements, and another that maintains position in the refuge, a control structure that may be ubiquitous in animals [23,24].",1607,283,550,28.0

In particular, people tend to be risk-averse for outcomes greater than their reference point, and risk-seeking for outcomes less than their reference point. A key question is where reference points come from. A common assumption is that reference points correspond to expectations about outcomes, but it is unclear whether people rely on a single global expectation, or multiple local expectations. If the latter, how do people determine which expectation to apply in a particular situation? We argue that people discover reference points using a form of Bayesian structure learning, which partitions outcomes into distinct contexts, each with its own reference point corresponding to the expected outcome in that context. Consistent with this theory, we show experimentally that dramatic change in the distribution of outcomes can induce the discovery of a new reference point, with systematic effects on risk preferences. By contrast, when changes are gradual, a single reference point is continuously updated.",4556,360,1602,28.0

At the macro scale, neuroimaging modalities such as MRI, EEG, and MEG, exploit a wide field of view to explore the brain as a global network of interacting regions. However, this comes at the price of either limited spatiotemporal resolution or limited sensitivity. At the micro scale, electrophysiology is used to explore the dynamic aspects of neuronal activity with a very high temporal resolution. However, this modality requires a statistical averaging of several tens of single task responses. A large-scale neuroimaging modality of sufficient spatial and temporal resolution and sensitivity to study brain region activation dynamically would open new territories of possibility in neuroscienceWe show that neurofunctional ultrasound imaging (fUS) is both able to assess brain activation during single cognitive tasks within superficial and deeper areas of the frontal cortex areas, and image the directional propagation of information within and between these regions. Equipped with an fUS device, two macaque rhesus monkeys were instructed before a stimulus appeared to rest (fixation) or to look towards (saccade) or away (antisaccade) from a stimulus. Our results identified an abrupt transient change in activity for all acquisitions in the supplementary eye field (SEF) when the animals were required to change a rule regarding the task cued by a stimulus. Simultaneous imaging in the anterior cingulate cortex and SEF revealed a time delay in the directional functional connectivity of 0.27 ± 0.07 s and 0.9 ± 0.2 s for animals S and Y, respectively. These results provide initial evidence that recording cerebral hemodynamics over large brain areas at a high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity with neurofunctional ultrasound can reveal instantaneous monitoring of endogenous brain signals and behavior.",1061,131,537,19.0

One way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behavior (the “direct effect”), and plasticity within individuals in response to the social environment (the “indirect effect”). A positive correlation between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate social contagion and selection on cooperative behavior. Testing this hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated measures of behavior across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an automated data-logging system to quantify the behavior of 179 wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions, and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in cooperative behavior. Our results show strong positive correlations between a bird’s own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners, consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation. These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can facilitate selection for cooperative behavior within social networks.",1661,251,463,29.0

Studying the intertwined roles of sensation, experience and directed action in navigation has been made easier by the development of virtual reality (VR) environments for head-fixed animals, which allow for quantitative measurements of behavior in well-controlled sensory conditions. VR has long featured in studies of Drosophila melanogaster, but these experiments have typically relied on one-dimensional (1D) VR, effectively allowing the fly to change only its heading in a visual scene, and not its position. Here we explore how flies navigate in a two-dimensional (2D) visual VR environment that more closely resembles their experience during free behavior. We show that flies’ interaction with landmarks in 2D environments cannot be automatically derived from their behavior in simpler 1D environments. Using a novel paradigm, we then demonstrate that flies in 2D VR adapt their behavior in a visual environment in response to optogenetically delivered appetitive and aversive stimuli. Much like free-walking flies after encounters with food, head-fixed flies respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing neurons by initiating a local search behavior. Finally, by pairing optogenetic activation of heat-sensing cells to the flies’ presence near visual landmarks of specific shapes, we elicit selective learned avoidance of landmarks associated with aversive “virtual heat”. These head-fixed paradigms set the stage for an interrogation of fly brain circuitry underlying flexible navigation in complex visual environments.",3628,476,1899,60.0

Although it is widely appreciated that vocalizations can convey information on labile state, such as fear and aggression, very few studies have experimentally examined the acoustic expression of short-term stress state. The transmission of such information about physiological state could have broad implications, potentially allowing other individuals to modify their behavior or life history traits in response to this public information. North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) produce vocalizations known as rattles that advertise territorial ownership. We examined the influence of changes in physiological stress state on rattle acoustic structure through the application of a stressor (trapping and handling the squirrels) and by provisioning squirrels with exogenous glucocorticoids (GCs). We characterized the acoustic structure of rattles emitted by these squirrels by measuring rattle duration, mean frequency, and entropy. Our results provide mixed evidence that rattles show a “stress signature”. When squirrels were trapped and handled, they produced rattles that were longer in duration with a higher frequency and increased entropy. However, squirrels that were administered exogenous GCs had similar rattle duration, frequency, and entropy as squirrels that received control treatments and unmanipulated (unfed) squirrels. Our results indicate that short-term stress does affect the acoustic structure of vocalizations, but elevated circulating GC levels are not solely responsible for such changes.",737,139,258,31.0

Here we developed a subchronic peripheral immune challenge model to examine delayed and persistent memory impairments in females and in males. We show that intermittent injections of either lipopolysaccharide or Poly I:C cause memory decline in both sexes that are evident eight weeks after the immune challenge. Importantly, we observed sex-specific patterns of deficits. Females showed impairments in object recognition one week after challenge that persisted for at least eight weeks. In contrast, males had intact memory one week after the immune challenge but exhibited broad impairments in memory tasks including object recognition, and both context and tone fear conditioning several months later. The differential patterns of memory deficits in males and in females were observed without sustained microglial activation or changes in blood-brain barrier permeability. Together, these data suggest that transient neuroimmune activity results in differential vulnerabilities of females and males to memory decline after immune challenge. This model will be an important tool for determining the mechanisms in both sexes that contribute to memory impairments that develop over the weeks and months after recovery from illness. Future studies using this model will provide new insights into the role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of long-lasting memory decline and dementias.",1652,453,582,29.0

Naïve individuals may learn how to forage, or avoid predators through group vigilance. Understanding these benefits, however, requires an appreciation of the opportunities juveniles have to associate with (and learn from) others. Here we describe social groups in terms of residency, movement, relatedness, and social associations from the perspective of juvenile hihi, a threatened New Zealand passerine bird. Over three years, we identified individuals in groups, their relatedness, and behavioural interactions. Using multistate analysis, we compared movement and residency of adults and juveniles and found that groups were composed predominately of juveniles which remained at group sites for longer than more transient adults. Movement of juveniles between groups did occur but was generally low. There was no evidence that siblings and parents were likely to be seen in groups together. With an initial understanding of group structure, we next asked what characteristics predicted assortment in social network associations. By identifying groups of co-occurring juveniles from time-stamped observations of individual hihi and building a social network, we found that juveniles were most likely to associate with other juveniles. Associations were also predominantly based on locations where hihi spent the most time, reflecting limited movement among separate groups. We suggest groups are best described as “gangs” where young hihi have little interaction with adults. These spatially-separated groups of juveniles may have consequences for social information use during the first few months of independence in young birds.",856,198,314,32.0

Many animals exhibit changeable patterns of social behavior based on development, and social experience during the juvenile period can be vital for the development of necessary social behaviors in adulthood. We investigated the development of a distinctive tactile interaction behavior in Corydoras aeneus, the Bronze Cory catfish. Adults use this behavior to coordinate group activities during foraging and flight responses from predators, and the development of this behavior in larvae is of interest in investigating how communication and social behaviors develop as an individual matures, and which factors affect their development. We found that larvae respond to applied tactile stimulation with a flight response far less often as larvae matured, implying that larvae become less sensitive to tactile stimulation with age. Given that adults frequently interact with one another tactilely, this development is consistent with developing appropriate social behavior in adulthood. We also found that social exposure affects the development of the larval response to tactile interactions with conspecifics, and that isolation in the earliest larval stage leads to a greater likelihood of responding to a tactile interaction with a conspecific with a flight response. This suggests that social exposure is important for developing an appropriate response to tactile stimulation in social settings and underscores the particular importance of early life experiences in the development of sociality.",691,344,358,17.0

Fungal infected cadavers surround the main foraging trails of the carpenter ant Camponotus rufipes, offering a system to study how foragers behave given the persistent occurrence of disease threats. Studies on social insect foraging behavior typically require many hours of human labor due to the high density of individuals. To overcome this, we developed deep learning based computer vision algorithms to track foraging ants, frame-by-frame, from video footage. We found foragers can be divided into behavioral categories based on how straight they walk across the trail. Eighty percent of ants walk directly across the trail, while 20% wander or circle when crossing the trail. Departure from the main trail encourages exploration of new areas and could enhance discovery of new food resources. Conversely, results from our agent-based model simulations suggest deviation from a straight path exposes foragers to more infectious fungal spores. Consistency in walking behavior may protect most ants from infection, while the foragers with increased exposure due to their mode of walking could be a sufficient number of new hosts to sustain disease in this environment.",916,293,358,27.0

Here we investigated whether North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were able to minimize costs of territory defence by adjusting behaviour in response to the familiarity of neighbouring conspecifics. Since red squirrels living in familiar neighbourhoods face reduced intrusion risk, we predicted that increasing familiarity among territorial neighbours would allow squirrels to spend less time on territorial defence and more time in the nest. Long-term behavioural data (1995-2004) collected from the same squirrels across several different social environments indicated that red squirrels reduced rates of territorial vocalizations and increased nest use in response to increasing familiarity with neighbours. In contrast, cross-sectional data (2015-2016), which provided observations from each individual in a single social environment, did not provide evidence of this plasticity. Post-hoc analyses revealed that evidence of social plasticity in this system was primarily due to within-individual changes in behaviour, which we were unable to estimate in the cross-sectional data. Our results demonstrate that red squirrels can reduce the costs of territoriality by appropriately adjusting behaviour in response to changes in their social environment. However, our results also suggest that estimating plasticity by comparing behaviour among individuals (i.e. cross-sectional analyses) may not always be reliable. Our ability to detect these effects may therefore depend on having data with multiple observations from the same individuals across different social environments.",812,194,370,32.0

In the current study, we attempted to replicate the wakeful rest effect under conditions that more strictly limit the possibility of rehearsal. Across six experiments, we manipulated parameters of a standard wakeful rest paradigm, including the type of target materials (word lists or  shapes), intentionality of encoding (incidental or intentional), and final retrieval delay (immediate or delayed). Additionally, we tested both younger and older adults to test whether these effects are consistent across the adult lifespan. Importantly, we observed the expected wakeful rest memory benefit in recall for verbal targets, which are easily rehearseable, but not for  shapes, which cannot be readily rehearsed. This pattern occurred in both younger and older adults. These results place constraints on the generalizability of wakeful rest memory benefits and suggest that the effect may be at least partly driven by rehearsal processes, rather than an automatic consolidation process.",1988,340,735,62.0

The verbena EO intake was higher in the D group than in the C group from D1 to D6 and the cardamom EO intake was lower in the D group than in the C group from D6 to D13.In experiment 2, half of the groups had access to water only and the other half was offered water and the 3 EO simultaneously. The EO were not differently chosen by chicks between D and C groups except a lower cardamom EO intake was observed in the D group than in the C group from D6 to D12. The delayed placement of the D group reduced chicken growth until 34 days of age and temporarily increased the feed conversion ratio, but did not affect their welfare or the prevalence of health disorders. The EO intake did not allow the chicks in the D group to overcome the growth reduction, but did overcome the reduction in Pectoralis major muscle yield.

A major exception is the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), which is robustly risk-seeking. Macaques‘ unique preferences may reflect their unique evolutionary history. Alternatively, they may derive from elements of task design associated with the demands of physiological recording, the source of nearly all macaque risk preference data. To disambiguate these possibilities we assessed macaques’ risk attitudes in a somewhat more naturalistic environment: subjects foraged at four feeding stations in a large enclosure. Stations (i.e. patches) provided either stochastically or non-stochastically depleting rewards. Subjects’ patch residence times were longer at safe than at risky stations, indicating a preference for safe options. This preference was not attributable to a win-stay-lose-shift heuristic. These findings highlight the lability of risk attitudes in macaques and support the hypothesis that observed differences between macaques and other species are ephemeral, not evolved.",765,178,368,27.0

Abe, Masakazu Shimada",453316;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/453316,"From microorganism to vertebrates, living things often exhibit social aggregation. One of anuran larvae, dark-bodied toad tadpoles (genus Bufo) are known to aggregate against predators. When individuals share genes from a common ancestor for whom social aggregation was a functional trait, they are also likely to share common recognition cues regarding association preferences, while greater genetic distances make cohesive aggregation difficult. In this study, we conducted quantitative analyses to examine aggregation behavior among three lineages of toad tadpoles: Bufo japonicus japonicus, B. japonicus formosus, and B. gargarizans miyakonis. To determine whether there is a correlation between cohesiveness and genetic similarity among group members, we conducted an aggregation test using 42 cohorts consisting of combinations drawn from a laboratory-reared set belonging to distinct clutches. As genetic indices, we used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles. The results clearly indicated that aggregation behavior in toad tadpoles is directly influenced by genetic distances based on mtDNA sequences and not on MHC haplotypes. Cohesiveness among heterogeneous tadpoles is negatively correlated with the geographic dispersal of groups. Our findings suggest that social incompatibility among toad tadpoles reflects phylogenetic relationships.",716,107,282,26.0

Plochocka",453431;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/453431,"A dot in the vastness of the Atlantic, Ascension Island remains a lifelong goal for the green sea turtles that hatched there, returning as adults every three or four years to nest. This navigating puzzle was brought to the scientific community’s attention by Charles Darwin and remains a topic of considerable speculation. Various cues have been suggested, with orientation to geomagnetic field elements and following odour plumes to their island source among the most compelling. Via a comprehensive in silico investigation we test the hypothesis that multimodal cue following, in which turtles utilise multiple guidance cues, is the most effective strategy. Specifically, we combine agent-based and continuous-level modelling to simulate displaced virtual turtles as they attempt to return to the island. Our analysis shows how population homing efficiency improves as the number of utilised cues is increased, even under “extreme” scenarios where the overall strength of navigating information decreases. Beyond the paradigm case of green turtles returning to Ascension Island, we believe this could commonly apply throughout animal navigation.Acknowledgements.We thank Thomas Hillen and Jonathan Sherratt for insightful comments on earlier drafts and the anonymous reviewers whose suggestions have improved the manuscript.

Broodiness in poultry is characterized by persistent nesting, usually associated with cessation of egg laying. The study of avian broodiness is essential for bird conservation breeding and commercial poultry industry. In this study, we examined the hypothalamus transcriptome of Muscovy duck in three reproductive stages, including egg-laying anaphase (LA), brooding prophase (BP) and brooding metaphase (BM). Differences in gene expression during the transition from egg-laying to broodiness were examined, and 155, 379, 292 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by pairwise comparisons of LA-vs-BP, LA-vs-BM and BP-vs-BM, respectively (fold change≥ 1.5, P &lt; 0.05). Gene Ontology Term (GO) enrichment analysis suggested a possible role of oxidative stress in the hypothalamus might invoke reproductive costs that potentially change genes expression. KEGG analysis revealed glutamatergic synapse, dopaminergic synapse, serotonergic synapse and GABAergic synapse pathway were significantly enriched, and regulator genes were identified. Eight gene expression patterns were illustrated by trend analysis and further clustered into three clusters. Additional six hub genes were identified through combining trend analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Our results suggested that the cyclical mechanisms of reproductive function conversion include effects of oxidative stress, biosynthesis of neurotransmitters or their receptors, and interactions between glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones and regulatory genes. These candidate genes and biological pathways may be used as targets for artificial manipulation and marker-assisted breeding in the reproductive behavior.",698,121,271,31.0

Many social animals enjoy reduced predation risk as a result of grouping, and individuals within groups can benefit from information transferred by their group-mates about a potential predator. We present evidence that a tactile interaction behavior we term ‘nudging’ substantially modified group responses to a potential threat in a highly social catfish species, Corydoras aeneus. These catfish deployed nudges during flight responses, and these nudges were associated with a greater likelihood of group cohesion following a threat event. Increased nudging behavior resulted in longer flight responses. In addition, individuals that perceived the threat first were more likely to initiate nudges, implying that nudges could be used to alert group-mates to the presence of a threat.

North American red squirrels are a territorial species in which ‘rattles’ have long been thought to be the principal signal communicating territory ownership. These vocalizations have been assumed to deter intruders, thus reducing energy costs and the risk of injury associated with direct aggressive interactions. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here we used a speaker occupation experiment to test whether red squirrel rattles function to deter conspecific rivals. We studied 29 male squirrels and removed each individual from his territory twice in a paired design. During the experimental treatment we simulated the owner’s presence after its removal by broadcasting the owner’s rattle from a loudspeaker at the center of the territory once every seven minutes. During the control treatment the territory was left in silence after the temporary removal of the owner. We found that the presence of a speaker replacement reduced the probability of intrusion by 34% and increased the latency to first intrusion by 7%, providing support for the hypothesis that rattles play an active role in reducing intrusion risk. However, intrusions were not completely averted by the speaker replacement, indicating that vocalizations alone are not sufficient without other cues of the territory owner.",576,197,296,15.0

We studied relative abundance indices (RAI) and activity patterns of each species, temporal overlap between sympatric species, and effects of moon cycle on predator-prey relationships, through camera-trapping in tropical semi-evergreen forests of Manas National Park. A total of 35 species were photo-captured with 16214 independent records over 7337 trap nights. Overall, relatively high number of photographs was obtained for large herbivores (11 species, n=13669), and low number of photographs were recorded for large carnivores (five species, n=657). Activity periods were classified into four categories: diurnal (day-time), nocturnal (night-time), crepuscular (twilight), and cathemeral (day and night time) of which 52% records were found in diurnal period followed by 37% in nocturnal phase whereas only 11% photographs during twilight. Small carnivores were strictly nocturnal (leopard cat and civets) or diurnal (yellow-throated marten and mongooses); whereas large carnivores were cathemeral (tiger, leopard, clouded leopard and Asiatic black bear). Analysis of activity patterns throughout the 24-h cycle revealed a high degree of temporal overlap (&gt;60%) among most of the sympatric species; however, differences in the activity peaks were found between most of the species pairs. Moon phase was classified according to the percentage of visible moon surface as new (0-25%), waxing (25-50%), waning (50-75%) and full moon (75-100%). Moon phase did not have any correlation with activity of large carnivore and large prey. The large carnivore followed the feed and starve pattern of cyclic activity. The activity of small carnivore was influenced negatively by moonlight (partial correlation r = −0.221, p&lt;0.01). The result suggests that large carnivores were active non-differentially across moon phases; however, small carnivores showed significantly high activity in darker nights.

1513,Visual control of landing maneuvers in houseflies on vertical and inverted surfaces,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/448472v2,"Sujay Balebail, Satish K Raja, Sanjay P. Sane",448472;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/448472,"Landing maneuvers in flies are complex behaviors that may be conceptually decomposed into a sequence of modular behaviors such as body deceleration, extension of legs, and body rotations which are coordinated to ensure controlled touchdown. The composite nature of these behaviors means that there is variability in the kinematics of landing maneuvers, making it difficult to identify the general rules that govern this behavior. Many previous studies have relied on tethered preparations to study landing behaviors, but tethering constrains some behavioral modules to operate in an open feedback control loop while others remain in closed-loop, thereby inducing experimental artefacts. On the other hand, freely flying insects are hard to precisely control, which may also increase behavioral variability. One approach towards understanding the general rules underlying landing behavior is to determine the common elements of landing kinematics on surfaces that are oriented in different ways. We conducted a series of experiments in which the houseflies, Musca Domestica, were lured to specific visual targets on either vertical or inverted horizontal substrates. These conditions elicited landing behaviors in the flies that could be captured accurately using multiple high-speed video cameras. We filmed the houseflies landing on surfaces oriented along two directions: vertical (vertical landings), and upside down (inverted landings). Our experiments reveal that flies that are able to land feet-first in a controlled manner must satisfy specific criteria, failing which their landing performance is compromised causing their heads to bump into the surface during landing. Flies landing smoothly on both surfaces initiate deceleration at approximately fixed distances from the substrate and in direct proportion to the component of flight velocity normal to the landing surface. The ratio of perpendicular distance to the substrate and velocity at the onset of deceleration was conserved, despite the large differences in the mechanics of the vertical vs. inverted landings. Flies extend their legs independently of distance from the landing surface or their approach velocity normal to the surface, regardless of the orientation of the landing substrate. Together, these results show that the visual initiation of deceleration is robust to orientation of the landing surface, whereas the initiation of leg-extension may be context-dependent and variable which allows flies to land on substrates of various orientations in a versatile manner. These findings may also be of interest to roboticists that are interested in developing flapping robots that can land on surfaces of different orientations.",1125,256,312,28.0

The mechanisms by which familiarity assists coordination are not well known. Prior social experience may simply allow individuals to learn the behavioral tendencies of familiar group-mates and coordinate accordingly. In the absence of prior social experience, it would be adaptive for individuals to develop strategies for coping with unfamiliar others to minimize the disadvantage of unfamiliarity. To explore the dynamics of familiarity in shaping group behaviors, we used a highly social catfish, Corydoras aeneus, that utilizes a distinctive, observable tactile interactions. Here we describe this tactile interaction behavior, physical “nudges” that are deployed to initiate group movements and maintain contact with group-mates during group movements. We then report the results of two experiments exploring the relationship between nudges and coordination. First, within triplets of two familiar and one unfamiliar individual, we found no individual differences in nudging rate based on familiarity. Despite all individuals interacting at similar rates, however, unfamiliar individuals failed to coordinate as well as their familiar group-mates, and were more frequently absent from group movements. Second, comparing pairs of familiar with pairs of unfamiliar fish, there was no difference in the level of coordination between pairs. Instead, we found that unfamiliar pairs exhibited significantly higher nudging rates, suggesting that unfamiliar pairs could compensate for their unfamiliarity by nudging more frequently. In contrast, familiar individuals coordinated with comparatively little nudging, presumably because they were experienced with each other. Overall, these results suggest that nudges can be used to improve coordination of group activities, but that their usage is reduced in the case of familiar individuals, implying that these potential signals may be costly.",928,117,223,19.0

The diversity of social learning phenomena has engendered a diverse terminology and numerous ideas about underlying learning mechanisms, at the same time that some researchers have called for a unitary analysis of social learning in terms of associative processes. Leveraging previous attempts and a recent computational formulation of associative learning, we analyze the following learning scenarios in some generality: learning responses to social stimuli, including learning to imitate; learning responses to non-social stimuli; learning sequences of actions; learning to avoid danger. We conceptualize social learning as situations in which stimuli that arise from other individuals have an important role in learning. This role is supported by genetic predispositions that either cause responses to social stimuli or enable social stimuli to reinforce specific responses. Our explorations show that, when guided by such predispositions, associative processes can give rise to a wide variety of social learning phenomena, such as stimulus and local enhancement, contextual imitation and simple production imitation, observational conditioning, and social and response facilitation. In addition, we clarify how associative mechanisms can result in transfer of information and behavior from experienced to naïve individuals.",1755,346,924,31.0

The activity of mouse was recorded 5 minutes before, during (for 30 minutes) and 40 minutes after the administration of anesthetic sevoflurane [1-, 1.5- and 2-fold minimum alveolar concentration] at 37° C. The total walking distance and velocity of movement were measured and quantified as the indexes of locomotion. We found that the anesthetic sevoflurane increased the locomotion of the mice during the induction of the anesthesia. During the recovery phase after anesthesia, the mice exhibited increased locomotion for a short period of time (about 5 minutes) and then displayed a sharp decrease in mobility for up to 60 minutes following the end of anesthesia administration. The anesthetic sevoflurane did not significantly alter the food intake and body weight of the mice. Furthermore, we found that Alzheimer’ s disease transgenic mice exhibited a greater sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity than the wild-type mice did. Our results showed that inhalation of the anesthetic sevoflurane induced an acute hyperactivity in mice, particularly among Alzheimer’ s disease transgenic mice.

We performed a speaker replacement experiment where red squirrels (n = 41) were temporarily removed from their territories and replaced with a speaker broadcasting their own call, an unfamiliar call, or silence. Contrary to our prediction, there were no differences in overall intrusion risk among our three playbacks, but the identity of intruders did vary.

However, it remains unclear whether animals can rely solely on temporal cues for odor source segregation. Here we show that 1) flies can use a few milliseconds differences in odorant arrival to segregate a target odorant from a binary mixture, 2) segregation does not improve when the target odorant arrives first, and 3) segregation works for odorants with innate, as well as learned valences.

Broiler breeders often show signs of chronic hunger, lack of satiety and feeding frustration, and the development of alternative feeding strategies has investigated the inclusion of calcium propionate (CaP) as an appetite suppressant. However, the mechanisms involved in the reduction of voluntary feed intake are unknown, but are thought to be due to low palatability, gastrointestinal discomfort, or both. The objective of this experiment was to examine the effect of CaP as an appetite suppressant on the experience of a negative affective state, using a conditioned place preference test. Twenty four broiler breeders were trained to associate the consumption of CaP or a placebo pill with a red or blue place, depending on inherent colour preference. Pullets consumed two pills followed by 20 g feed allotment. The CaP pill contained 160 mg of CaP and the placebo pill had 160 mg of feed. Conditioning lasted for 90 min/pullet/day over 8 consecutive days at 7 and 9 weeks of age, and pullets’ choice was tested in a T-maze twice on two consecutive days at both 8 and 10 weeks of age. Data were analysed using a linear mixed regression model, with pen nested in the model and age as a repeated measure. Pullets were less likely to choose the place conditioned with the consumption of CaP (P&lt;0.05) and the preference of the placebo linearly increased with training sessions (P&lt;0.05). These results suggest that calcium propionate as an appetite suppressant can induce a negative affective state, with the lower feed intake resulting from a conditioned response to the negative effect of calcium propionate rather than to satiety.",644,106,213,33.0

Here, we tested the effects of the cell type-specific inactivation of NMDA receptors in DA neurons in adult mice on stimulus-reward learning. Animals were trained in a Pavlovian learning paradigm in which they had to learn the predictive value of two conditioned stimuli, one of which (CS+) was paired with the delivery of a water reward. Over the course of conditioning, mutant mice learned that the CS+ predicted reward availability, and they approached the reward receptacle more frequently during CS+ trials than CS− trials. However, conditioned responses to the CS+ were weaker in the mutant mice, possibly indicating that they did not attribute incentive salience to the CS+. To further assess whether the attribution of incentive salience was impaired by the mutation, animals were tested in a conditioned reinforcement test. The test revealed that mutant mice made fewer instrumental responses paired with CS+ presentation, confirming that the CS+ had a weaker incentive value. Taken together, these results indicate that reward prediction learning does occur in the absence of NMDA receptors in DA neurons, but the ability of reward-paired cues to invigorate and reinforce behavior is lost.",812,80,286,10.0

However, the elements of the top-down circuitry encoding the memory of the location of food is largely unknown, as are the high-order processes that control satiety. Here we report that hippocampal dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) neurons are specifically activated by food and that modulation of their activity reduce food intake in mice. We also found that activation of these neurons interferes with the valence of food and the acquisition of a spatial memory linking food to a location via projections from the hippocampus to the lateral septum. Finally, we showed that inputs from lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) to the hippocampus can also drive satiety via activation of D2R cells. These data describe a previously unidentified function for hippocampal D2R cells to regulate feeding behavior and identifies a LEC-&gt;Hippocampus-&gt;Septal high-order circuit that encodes the memory of food location.",1514,277,757,52.0

Lockwood",438374;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/438374,"Fighting between different species is widespread in the animal kingdom, yet this phenomenon has been relatively understudied in the field of aggression research. Particularly lacking are studies that test the effect of genetic distance, or relatedness, on aggressive behavior between species. Here we characterized male-male aggression within and between species of fruit flies across the Drosophila phylogeny. We show that male Drosophila discriminate between conspecifics and heterospecifics and show a bias for the target of aggression that depends on the genetic relatedness of opponent males. Specifically, males of closely related species treated conspecifics and heterospecifics equally, whereas males of distantly related species were overwhelmingly aggressive toward conspecifics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify aggression between Drosophila species and to establish a behavioral bias for aggression against conspecifics versus heterospecifics. Our results suggest that future study of heterospecific aggression behavior in Drosophila is warranted to investigate the degree to which these trends in aggression among species extend to broader behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary contexts.Author contributionsTG and BLL conceived and planned the study.

Hofmann",437772;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/437772,"The ability to reliably identify individuals over time and across contexts is essential in numerous areas of science. There are a variety of well-established methods for uniquely marking individuals, such as using paint or dye, visible implant elastomer tags, numbers or barcodes glued to the animal, passive integrated transponders, and more. For some species, life history stages, and/or experiments, however, these existing tagging methods are not sufficient. Here, we describe the method we developed for tagging juveniles of the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, which are too small for the methods used to tag adults. We used fishing line threaded through the needle of an insulin syringe to tie a loop of line through the dorsal muscle of juveniles as small as 10 mm standard length. Unique color patterns on the line can be used to distinguish among individuals. The tag is compatible with normal locomotion and social behavior, discernible to the eye and on camera, durable enough to last at least months, and the juvenile can grow with the tag. For A. burtoni, which is a model system in social neuroscience, the lack of an appropriate tagging method for very small juveniles likely contributes to the relative lack of early-life studies, and the same may be true for other small species. We expect this method to be useful in a variety of species and will facilitate the integration of organismal and behavioral development into more research programs.",1747,256,480,12.0

Carter, Gabriele Schino, Damien Farine",372516;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/372516,"Nepotism and reciprocity are not mutually exclusive explanations for cooperation, because helping decisions can depend on both kinship cues and past reciprocal help. The importance of these two factors can therefore be difficult to disentangle using observational data. We developed a resampling procedure for inferring the statistical power to detect observational evidence of nepotism and reciprocity. We first applied this procedure to simulated datasets resulting from perfect reciprocity, where the probability and duration of helping events from individual A to B equaled that from B to A. We then assessed how the probability of detecting correlational evidence of reciprocity was influenced by (1) the number of helping observations and (2) varying degrees of simultaneous nepotism. Last, we applied the same analysis to empirical data on food sharing in vampire bats and allogrooming in mandrills and Japanese macaques. We show that at smaller sample sizes, the effect of kinship was easier to detect and the relative role of kinship was overestimated compared to the effect of reciprocal help in both simulated and empirical data, even with data simulating perfect reciprocity and imperfect nepotism. We explain the causes and consequences of this difference in power for detecting the roles of kinship versus reciprocal help. To compare the relative importance of genetic and social relationships, we therefore suggest that researchers measure the relative reliability of both coefficients in the model by plotting these coefficients and their detection probability as a function of sampling effort. We provide R scripts to allow others to do this power analysis with their own datasets.",1376,261,614,40.0

Mooij, Ieva Misevičiūtė, Damiaan Denys, Ingo Willuhn",435172;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/435172,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessive thinking, compulsive behavior, and anxiety, and is often accompanied by cognitive deficits. The neuropathology of OCD involves dysregulation of cortical-striatal circuits. Similar to OCD patients, SAPAP3 knockout mice 3 (SAPAP3−/−) exhibit compulsive behavior (grooming), anxiety, and dysregulated cortical-striatal function. However, it is unknown whether SAPAP3−/− display cognitive deficits and how these different behavioral traits relate to one another. SAPAP3−/− and wild-type littermates (WT) were trained in a Pavlovian conditioning task pairing the delivery of visual cues with that of sucrose solution. After mice learned to discriminate between a reward-predicting conditioned stimulus (CS+) and a non-reward stimulus (CS−), contingencies were reversed (CS+ became CS− and vice versa). Additionally, we assessed grooming, anxiety, and general activity. SAPAP3−/− acquired Pavlovian approach behavior similarly to WT, albeit less vigorously and with a different strategy. However, unlike WT, SAPAP3−/− were unable to adapt their behavior after contingency reversal, exemplified by a lack of re-establishing CS+ approach behavior (sign tracking). Surprisingly, such behavioral inflexibility, decreased vigor, compulsive grooming, and anxiety were unrelated. This study demonstrates that SAPAP3−/− are capable of Pavlovian learning, but lack flexibility to adapt associated conditioned approach behavior. Thus, SAPAP3−/− do not only display compulsive-like behavior and anxiety, but also cognitive deficits, confirming and extending the validity of SAPAP3−/− as a suitable model for OCD. The observation that compulsive-like behavior, anxiety, and behavioral inflexibility were unrelated suggests a non-causal relationship between these traits and may be of clinical relevance for OCD patients.",1423,197,616,27.0

Dickinson",433771;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/433771,"Resources are often sparsely clustered in nature. Thus, foraging animals may benefit from remembering the location of a newly discovered food patch while continuing to explore nearby [1, 2]. For example, after encountering a drop of yeast or sugar, hungry flies often perform a local search consisting of frequent departures and returns to the food site [3, 4]. Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, can perform this food-centered search behavior in the absence of external stimuli or landmarks, instead relying solely on internal (idiothetic) cues to keep track of their location [5]. This path integration behavior may represent a deeply conserved navigational capacity in insects [6, 7], but the neural pathways underlying food-triggered searches remain unknown. Here, we used optogenetic activation to screen candidate cell classes and found that local searches can be initiated by diverse sensory neurons including sugar-sensors, water-sensors, olfactory-receptor neurons, as well as hunger-signaling neurons of the central nervous system. Optogenetically-induced searches resemble those triggered by actual food and are modulated by starvation state. Furthermore, search trajectories exhibit key features of path integration: searches remain tightly centered around the fictive-food site, even during long periods without reinforcement, and flies re-center their searches when they encounter a new fictive-food site. Flies can even perform elaborate local searches within a constrained maze. Together, these results suggest that flies enact local searches in response to a wide variety of food-associated cues, and that these sensory pathways may converge upon a common neural system for path integration. Optogenetically induced local searches in Drosophila can now serve as a tractable system for the study of spatial memory and navigation in insects.",3393,261,1248,37.0

Although recent research has shown that adults can improve AP abilities in a single training session, the best learners still did not achieve note classification performance comparable to performance of a genuine AP possessor. Here, we demonstrate that genuine AP levels of performance can be trained in eight weeks for some adults, with the best learner passing all measures of AP ability after training and retaining this knowledge for at least four months after training. Alternative explanations of these positive results, such as improving accuracy through adopting a slower, relative pitch strategy, are not supported based on joint analyses of response time and accuracy. The post-training AP assessments were extensive, totaling 204 notes taken from eight different timbres and spanning over seven octaves. These results clearly demonstrate that explicit perceptual training in some adults can lead to AP performance that is behaviorally indistinguishable from AP that results from childhood development.

We designed a procedure in which participants were asked to decide whether a Gabor grating was oriented towards the left or the right. Presentation of the stimuli was immediately followed by a cue requiring a motor response that was irrelevant to the task but could be the same, opposite, or neutral to the correct response to the Gabor patch. After responding to the cue, participants were asked to rate their stimulus awareness using the Perceptual Awareness Scale, and then to report their discrimination decision. Participants reported a higher level of stimulus awareness after carrying out responses that were either congruent or incongruent with a response required by a stimulus, compared to the neutral condition. The results suggest that directional motor response (congruent or incongruent with correct response to the stimulus) provides information about the outcome of decision process and increases the reported awareness of stimuli.",1693,402,594,25.0

These locomotions have been recorded by laser velocimetry and copied in detail in their time sequences. The sequences are replicated by micro-controllers digital outputs acting on piezoelectric transducers placed several centimeters outside the peripheries of the pits: their actions on the surface of a sand media create surface waves with particle accelerations that are 3 orders of magnitude less than g, alleviating any possibility of sand avalanche towards the bottom of the pit. Depending on the amplitude of the vibrations, the antlions answer back, generally by sand tossing. One remarkable feature is the time delay from the start of the cue and the aggressive behavior induced by this cue. This time delay is studied versus the cue amplitude. The result of this work is that anlions answer back within minutes to cues with amplitudes between 1 to 2 nanometers at the level of their mechanosensors, and within seconds to these same cues if they are preceded by a sequence of signals at the Ångström amplitude. This induced aggressive behaviour evidences the sensitivity to vibrations at extremely low level.",8812,200,518,10.0

We filmed the social interactions of marked fish in both environments and analysed their social network dynamics using a Markov model under two different fish densities of 12 and 6 fish per 0.36 m2. As expected, surface mollies spent overall much more time social than cave mollies. This difference in overall social time was a result of surface mollies being less likely to discontinue social contact (once they had a social partner) and being more likely to resume social contact (once alone) than cave mollies. Interestingly surface mollies were also less likely to leave a current social partner than cave mollies. At low density, mollies (in both environments) were expected to show reduced social encounters which should dramatically change their social dynamics. Surface mollies, however, displayed an ability to maintain their social dynamics at low density (primarily by reducing the convex polygon spanned by the group) which was not observed in cave mollies. Despite the fact that we only compared two populations, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for density compensations of social dynamics that have also been observed in other fish species and give an example of how comparisons between the social dynamics of different populations can be made that go beyond conventional network analyses.",745,112,275,29.0

However, while reintroductions disrupt both the abiotic and social environments, there has been less focus on the consequences of social disruption. Therefore, here we investigate if moving familiar social groups may help animals (particularly naïve juveniles) adjust to their new environment and increase the chances of population establishment. We used social network analysis to study changes in group composition and individual sociality across a reintroduction of 40 juvenile hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a threatened New Zealand passerine. We collected observations of groups before a translocation to explore whether social behaviour before the reintroduction predicted associations after, and whether reintroduction influenced individual sociality (degree). We also assessed whether grouping familiar birds during temporary captivity in aviaries maintained group structure and individual sociality, compared to our normal translocation method (aviaries of random familiarity). Following release, we measured if survival depended on how individual sociality had changed. By comparing these analyses with birds that remained at the source site, we found that translocation lead to re-assortment of groups: non-translocated birds maintained their groups, but translocated juveniles formed groups with both familiar and unfamiliar birds. Aviary holding did not improve group cohesion; instead, juveniles were less likely to associate with aviary-mates. Finally, we found that translocated juveniles that lost the most associates experienced a small but significant tendency for higher mortality. This suggests sociality loss may have represented a disruption that affected their ability to adapt to a new site.",1205,101,372,30.0

Social learning by observing parents (vertical transmission) or others (horizontal/oblique transmission) may be important to overcome naivety, but these tutors are likely to differ in their reliability due to variation in their own experience. How young animals use different social information sources, however, has received little attention. Here we tested if wild juvenile hihi (Notiomystis cincta, a New Zealand passerine) retained foraging behaviours learned from parents, or if behaviour changed after independence in response to peers. We first trained parents with feeders during chick rearing: one-third could access food from any direction, one-third could access food from one side only, and the remaining third had no feeder. During post-fledge parental care, juveniles chose the same side as their parents. Once independent, juveniles formed mixed-treatment groups naturally so we then presented feeders with two equally profitable sides. Juveniles with natal feeder experience were quicker to use these feeders initially, but side choice was now random. Over time, however, juveniles converged on using one side of the feeder (which differed between groups). This apparent conformity was because juvenile hihi paid attention to the behaviour of their group and were more likely to choose the locally-favoured side as the number of visits to that side increased. They did not copy the choice of specific individuals, even when they were more social or more familiar with the preceding bird.

Premating reproductive isolation, often the result of mate choice, is a major obstacle to gene flow between species because it acts earlier in the life cycle than other isolating barriers. While female choice is often considered the default mode in animal species, research in the butterfly genus Heliconius, a frequent subject of speciation studies, has focused on male mate choice. We studied mate choice by H. cydno females by pairing them with either conspecific males or males of the closely related species H. pachinus. Significantly more intraspecific trials than interspecific trials resulted in mating. Because male courtship rates did not differ between the species when we excluded males that never courted, we attribute this difference to female choice. Females also performed more acceptance behaviours towards conspecific males. Premating isolation between these two species thus entails both male and female mate choice, and female choice may be an important factor in the origin of Heliconius species.",1848,251,659,20.0

However, ants show a remarkable diversity in their social organization, from a monogynous-monandrous queen to the more derived states of polygyny with polyandrous queens. The existence of polygyny is an evolutionary enigma, since kin selection theory predicts that while queens should strive for reproductive monopoly, workers are predicted to favor their own matriline in rearing gynes. Using a barcoding system that enables tracking of individual interactions, along with polymorphic DNA microsatellite markers that indicate the matriline and patriline of all individuals, we demonstrate the complex social interactions in polygyne nests of Cataglyphis niger. C. niger is not only polygyne but also constitutes a supercolony at the study site. Our pioneering findings that both queens and workers are not necessarily related to each other support the supercolony structure of the population. Also in line with supercoloniality, we demonstrate that the workers contribute equally to the nest production and rearing of the queens.

Here, we demonstrate that a key function of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is to regulate the vigor of a learned behavior at the moment of initiation in a habit-promoting manner. Shifts in vigor by phasic DLS perturbations coincide closely with how outcome-insensitive (i.e., habitual) the behaviors are in both response-based and cue-based task situations. Surprisingly, the control over habit strength by way of changes in vigor occurs without consistent changes in accuracy, suggesting that mechanisms controlling habit and vigor are dissociable from performance governed task rules. Finally, we show that increased DLS activity improves vigor preferentially when learned outcome values are stable, while reduced DLS activity dampens vigor preferentially when outcome values change.

The few studies available, in lizards, report lack of spontaneous discrimination of quantity, which may suggest that reptiles could represent an exception in numerical abilities among vertebrates. We investigated the spontaneous ability of Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni) to select the larger quantity of food items. Tortoises showed able to choose the larger food item when exposed with two options differing in size (0.25, 0.50, 0.67 and 0.75 ratio) and when presented with two groups differing in numerousness (1 versus 4, 2 versus 4, 2 versus 3 and 3 versus 4 items). The tortoises succeeded in both size and numerousness discrimination, and their performance appeared to depend on the ratio of items to be discriminated (thus following Weber’s Law). These findings in chelonians provide evidence of an ancient system for the extrapolation of numerical magnitudes from given sets of elements, shared among vertebrates.",772,105,342,19.0

Cognitive evolution appears to have been driven initially by selection on standing variation in perceptual traits followed by both hard and soft sweeps on learning and memory. Evolutionary modeling reveals that intense selection as observed in P. fuscatus is likely the norm during the early stages of cognitive evolution.

Responses to facial cues of strength are therefore thought to play an important role in human social interaction. Although many researchers have proposed that sexually dimorphic facial morphology is reliably correlated with physical strength, evidence for this hypothesis is somewhat mixed. Moreover, to date, only one study has investigated the putative relationship between facial masculinity and physical strength in women. Consequently, we tested for correlations between handgrip strength and objective measures of face-shape masculinity.Methods 531 women took part in the study. We measured each participant’s handgrip strength (dominant hand). Sexual dimorphism of face shape was objectively measured from each face photograph using two methods: discriminant analysis and vector analysis. These methods use shape components derived from principal component analyses of facial landmarks to measure the probability of the face being classified as male (discriminant analysis method) or to locate the face on a female-male continuum (vector analysis method).Results Our analyses revealed that handgrip strength is, at best, only weakly correlated with facial masculinity in women. There was a weak significant association between handgrip strength and one measure of women’s facial masculinity. The relationship between handgrip strength and our other measure of women’s facial masculinity was not significant.Discussion Together, these results do not support the hypothesis that face-shape masculinity is an important cue of physical strength, at least in women.",864,92,224,9.0

Social information transfer in maternity colonies might be a particularly efficient mechanism for naïve pups to acquire information on resources from informed adults. However, such behaviour is difficult to study in the wild, in particular in elusive and small-bodied animals such as bats.The goal of this study was to investigate the role of social information in acquiring access to two types of resources, which are crucial in the life of a juvenile bat: suitable roosting sites and fruitful feeding grounds. We hypothesized that fledging offspring will make use of social information by following informed members of the social groups to unknown roosts or foraging sites.In the present study we applied for the first time the newly developed miniaturized proximity sensor system ‘BATS’, a fully automated system for documenting associations among individual bats both while roosting and while on the wing. We quantified associations among juveniles and other group member while switching roosts and during foraging.We found clear evidence for information transfer while switching roosts, mainly among juveniles and their genetically identified mothers. Anecdotal observations suggest intentional guidance behaviour by mothers, indicated by repeated commuting flights among the pup and the target roost. Infrequent, short meetings with colony members other than the mother indicate local enhancement at foraging sites, but no intentional information transfer.Our study illustrates how advances in technology enable researchers to solve long-standing puzzles. Miniaturized proximity sensors facilitate the automated collection of continuous data sets and represent an ideal tool to gain novel insights into the sociobiology of elusive and small-bodied species.",0,0,0,33.0

Distance of the nest from the centre or edge of the colony did not affect the reproductive success though rooks generally settled closer to the centre and further from the edge than it can be expected by assuming random distribution. The colony showed high breeding synchrony since date of egg laying varied less than date of nesting but synchrony did not influence the breeding success. Hatchling’s survival rate and number of offspring increased with local nest density and rooks clustered their nests more than it can be expected by random settlement. Nest sites of early and late nesters did not differ regarding the distance from the centre or the edge of the colony but late nesters chose nest sites in more densely populated regions.The results indicate that individuals may follow different strategies to increase their reproductive success. It is prospectively advantageous to build the nest and lay eggs earlier, in turn, it’s worth nesting in already more densely nested areas for late beginners. We suggest that a game theoretical approach may be useful if we try to understand the adaptive significance of colonial breeding.",825,113,214,23.0

When females mate multiply, but do not remate frequently, males can experience a lower level of sperm competition when mating with virgins. Male preference for virgins has been demonstrated many times in invertebrates but rarely in vertebrates. In this study, I tested if Anolis apletophallus males preferentially courted virgin females more than non-virgin females, in two-choice trails where the virgin was smaller than the non-virgin, and trails where the females were size-matched. In both trails males preferentially courted the virgin females more than non-virgin females. This suggests males can discriminate between females based on their reproductive history and that they do not use body size as a cue. Males most likely used visual signals from the female, although these signals could not be identified in this study. This is only the second study to show male preference for virgins in vertebrates. Although it is possible that male preference for virgins is relatively rare in vertebrates, I argue that certain life history traits, namely, where large females do not have reproductive benefits, and or when sperm is stored between subsequent reproductive events this preference function can evolve. Future studies focusing on such systems are likely to be fruitful with respect to this male mating preference and may help us to better understand the evolution of male mating preferences and female traits.",860,532,240,20.0

Although both flight maneuvers and aerodynamic mechanisms have been studied independently, little is known about how these interact in an environment where flow is already unsteady. Moths forage from flowers by hovering in the flower’s wake. We investigate hawkmoths tracking a 3D-printed robotic flower in a wind tunnel. We visualize the flow in the wake and around the wings and compare tracking performance to previous experiments in a still air flight chamber. Like in still air, moths flying in the flower wake exhibit near perfect tracking at low frequencies where natural flowers move. However, tracking in the flower wake results in a larger overshoot between 2-5 Hz. System identification of flower tracking reveals that moths also display reduced-order dynamics in wind, compared to still air. Smoke visualization of the flower wake shows that the dominant vortex shedding corresponds to the same frequency band as the increased overshoot. Despite these large effects on tracking dynamics in wind, the leading edge vortex (LEV) remains bound to the wing throughout the wingstroke and does not burst. The LEV also maintains the same qualitative structure seen in steady air. Persistence of a stable LEV during decreased flower tracking demonstrates the interplay between hovering and maneuvering.Summary statement We examined how moths maneuver in the wake of flowers and discover that flower tracking dynamics are simplified compared to still air, while the leading edge vortex does not burst and extends continuously across the wings and thorax.",1499,313,608,38.0

The most significant environmental factors affecting the presence of the snails were humidity and wind direction. There was a migration of snails into and out of the observable study area at different times of year. Due to the snail’s pace of 1.9 to 3 m/hr relative to its prey at 5-10m/hr the snails would need to migrate to and inhabit areas where there is likely to be trackable prey.

Davidson, Ahmed El Hady",416602;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/416602,"A canonical foraging task is the patch-leaving problem, in which a forager must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy. Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the current patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong to the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision making in different contexts especially in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We solve the model for conditions where foraging decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can represent different “strategies”, for example an increment-decrement or counting strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is uncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an energy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits underlying patch leaving decisions.",1351,228,459,39.0

It is, however, still debated whether or not wheel running itself is a stereotypy. New evidence emerged when Meijer and Robbers (2014, Proc. Royal Soc. B) reported voluntary wheel running of wild animals in the Netherlands. Since stereotypic behaviors are exclusively attributed to captive animals, the occurrence of wheel running in the wild suggests that this behavior is non-stereotypic. Our study explores that same line of investigation, examining whether wild animals will voluntarily use running wheels in a natural area in Paraguay in comparison to the urban and semi-urban settings in the Netherlands. Of the 1857 small mammal visits we recorded, only two occasions showed evidence of what could be considered as wheel running behavior; over hundredfold fewer than previously reported. The potential reasons for the observed difference in wheel running activity, such as different species pool or seasonality, are discussed. The difference, however, is likely to be due to the much lower probability of Neotropical mammals in a remote natural site encountering man-made objects and experiencing urbanization-related behavioral patterns. Additionally, in the light of our findings, we review the definition of wheel running as a stereotypic behavior.",1823,128,369,25.0

York, Russell D. Fernald",414045;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/414045,"For many species, social rank determines which individuals perform certain social behaviors and when. Higher ranking or dominant (DOM) individuals maintain status through aggressive interactions and perform courtship behaviors while non-dominant (ND) individuals do not. In some species ND individuals ascend (ASC) in social rank when the opportunity arises. Many important questions related to the mechanistic basis of social ascent remain to be answered. We probed whether androgen signaling regulates social ascent in male Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid whose social hierarchy can be readily controlled in the laboratory. As expected, androgen receptor (AR) antagonism abolished reproductive behavior during social ascent. However, we discovered multiple AR-dependent—and AR-independent—temporal behavioral patterns that typify social ascent and dominance. AR antagonism in ASC males reduced the speed of behavioral performance compared to DOM males. Socially ascending males, independent of AR activation, were more likely than DOM males to follow aggressive displays with another aggressive display. Further analyses revealed differences in the sequencing of aggressive and courtship behaviors, wherein DOM males were more likely than ASC males to follow male-directed aggression with courtship displays. Strikingly, this difference was driven mostly by ASC males taking longer to transition from aggression to courtship, suggesting ASC males can perform certain DOM-typical temporal behavioral patterns. Our results indicate androgen signaling drives social ascent, but hormonal signaling and social experience shape the full suite of DOM-typical behavioral patterns.Author’s contributions: Conceptualization, B.A.A. and R.D.F.; Methodology, B.A.A and R.D.F.; Investigation, B.A.A., A.T.H., and R.A.Y; Writing – Original Draft, B.A.A.; Writing – Review &amp; Editing, B.A.A., R.D.F, A.T.H, and R.A.Y; Supervision, B.A.A. and R.D.F.",928,175,485,26.0

To show this, we use two likelihood based methods (AICs and likelihood ratios).

Here we described a standing rest behaviour of medium sized Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) living on the roof of the world, Tibet Plateau, which has not been reported before. We named the standing rest behaviour here as Puppet behaviour, since the antelope can stand still for a certain time just like a Puppet. Of the total 304 focal individuals, 48.3% (98/203) of adult and sub-adult males expressed the Puppet behaviour, whereas only 6.3% (6/96) of females did, indicating an obvious sexual difference. Puppet behaviour occurred more frequently at noon and in the afternoon on sunny and cloudy days, meaning that day time and weather were both influential factors. Puppet behaviour was usually accompanied with rumination and sometimes ended with leg-shaking. Our results suggest that Puppet behaviour is probably an adaptive form of rest, which serves a thermoregulatory and anti-predation function, and is much simpler and safer than recumbent rest.",887,164,234,24.0

Automated tracking also improves replicability by avoiding observer biases and allowing reproducible workflows. However, few automated tracking programs exist that are open access, open source, and capable of tracking unmarked organisms in noisy environments.2. Tracktor is an image-based tracking freeware designed to perform single-object tracking in noisy environments, or multi-object tracking in uniform environments while maintaining individual identities. Tracktor is code-based but requires no coding skills other than the user being able to specify tracking parameters in a designated location, much like in a graphical user interface (GUI). The installation and use of the software is fully detailed in a user manual.3. Through four examples of common tracking problems, we show that Tracktor is able to track a variety of animals in diverse conditions. The main strengths of Tracktor lie in its ability to track single individuals under noisy conditions (e.g. when the object shape is distorted), its robustness to perturbations (e.g. changes in lighting conditions during the experiment), and its capacity to track multiple individuals while maintaining their identities. Additionally, summary statistics and plots allow measuring and visualizing common metrics used in the analysis of animal movement (e.g. cumulative distance, speed, acceleration, activity, time spent in specific areas, distance to neighbour, etc.).4. Tracktor is a versatile, reliable, easy-to-use automated tracking software that is compatible with all operating systems and provides many features not available in other existing freeware.

Therefore, in contrast to predictions of the “Gestalt” model, nestmate recognition cues in honey bee colonies do not represent a passive “average” signature that is carried and recognized by all colony members.

In this paper I develop a model of social information use and collective decision making by fully rational agents that reveals how a wide range of apparently stochastic social decision rules emerge from fundamental information asymmetries both between individuals, and between the decision-makers and the observer of those decisions. As well as showing that rational decision making is consistent with empirical observations of collective behaviour, this model makes several testable predictions about how individuals make decisions in groups, and offers a valuable perspective on how we view sources of variability in animal, and human, behaviour.",2050,143,695,12.0

To begin to understand the neural mechanisms underlying this texture preference behavior, we have determined relevant parameters of leech behavior both on uniform substrates of varying textures, and in a behavior choice paradigm in which the leech is confronted with a choice between rougher and smoother substrate textures at each step. We tested two non-exclusive mechanisms which could produce substrate texture preference: 1) a Diffusion Trap mechanism, in which a leech is more likely to stop moving on a smooth surface than on a rough one, and; 2) an Anterior Choice mechanism, in which a leech is more likely to attach its front sucker (prerequisite for taking a step) to a smooth surface than to a rough one. We propose that both mechanisms contribute to the texture preference exhibited by leeches.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank Lidia Szczupak and members of the Weisblat lab for helpful comments on the manuscript.",777,204,482,23.0

We developed a high-throughput paradigm to measure visual attention in freely-walking Drosophila, using competing foreground/background visual stimuli. We found that whereas sleep-deprived flies could respond normally to either stimulus alone, they were more distracted by background cues in a visual competition task. Other stressful manipulations such as starvation, heat exposure, and mechanical stress had no effects on visual attention in this paradigm. In contrast to sleep-deprivation, providing additional sleep using the GABA-A agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) did not affect attention in wild-type flies, but significantly improved attention in the learning mutant dunce. Our results reveal a key function of sleep in optimising attention processes in Drosophila, and establish a behavioural paradigm that can be used to explore the molecular mechanisms involved.Summary statement Sleep deprivation specifically impairs visual selective attention in fruit flies, without affecting behavioural responses to simple visual stimuli.",1713,339,504,31.0

Negative patterning constitutes a paradigmatic case of non-elemental learning, as subjects have to learn that single elements A and B are reinforced while their conjunctive representation AB is not reinforced (A+, B+ vs. AB-). Solving this problem requires treating the compound AB as being different from the linear sum of its components in order to overcome stimulus ambiguity (A+/A- and B+/B-). The honey bee is the only insect capable of mastering negative patterning as shown by numerous studies restricted mainly to the olfactory domain. Here we studied the capacity of bees to solve a negative patterning discrimination in the visual domain and used to this end a virtual reality (VR) environment in which a tethered bee walking stationary on a treadmill faces visual stimuli projected on a semicircular screen. Stimuli are updated by the bee’s movements, thus creating an immersive environment. Bees were trained to discriminate single-colored gratings rewarded with sucrose solution (blue, green; A+, B+) from a non-rewarded composite grating (blue-green, AB-). Bees learned this discrimination in the VR environment and inhibited to this end linear processing of the composite grating, which otherwise is treated as the sum of its components. Our results show for the first time mastering of a non-linear visual discrimination in a VR environment by honey bees, thus highlighting the value of VR for the study of cognition in insects.",1482,194,445,18.0

Consequently, we used a longitudinal design and measured steroid hormones from saliva to test for evidence of hormonal regulation of women’s (N=351) preferences for two aspects of male vocal masculinity (low pitch and low formants). Analyses suggested that preferences for masculine pitch, but not masculine formants, may track within-woman changes in estradiol. Although these results present some evidence for the hypothesis that within-subject hormones regulate women’s attraction to masculine men, we do not discount the possibility that the effect of estradiol on pitch preferences in the current study is a false positive.",952,140,276,58.0

To investigate how the brain translates sensory input into decisions during active sensation, we developed a mouse active touch task where the mechanosensory input can be precisely measured and that challenges animals to use multiple mechanosensory cues. Mice were trained to localise a pole using a single whisker and to report their decision by selecting one of three choices. Using high-speed imaging and machine vision we estimated whisker-object mechanical forces at millisecond resolution. Mice solved the task by a sensory-motor strategy where both the strength and direction of whisker bending were informative cues to pole location. We found competing influences of immediate sensory input and choice memory on mouse choice. On correct trials, choice could be predicted from the direction and strength of whisker bending, but not from previous choice. In contrast, on error trials, choice could be predicted from previous choice but not from whisker bending. This study shows that animal choices during active tactile decision making can be predicted from mechanosenory and choice-memory signals; and provides a new task, well-suited for future study of the neural basis of active perceptual decisions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Due to the difficulty of measuring the sensory input to moving sense organs, active perceptual decision making remains poorly understood. The whisker system provides a way forward since it is now possible to measure the mechanical forces due to whisker-object contact during behaviour. Here we train mice in a novel behavioural task that challenges them to use rich mechanosensory cues, but can be performed using one whisker and enables task-relevant mechanical forces to be precisely estimated. This approach enables rigorous study of how sensory cues translate into action during active, perceptual decision making. Our findings provide new insight into active touch and how sensory/internal signals interact to determine behavioural choices.",1625,97,382,51.0

Hauber",402941;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/402941,"Egg rejection is the most common defense against avian brood parasitism in which the host either removes the parasitic egg or deserts the parasitized clutch. The ability to recognize and reject a parasitic egg depends on bill morphology, sensory systems, and cognition, all of which are also shaped by other selective processes, such as foraging. This begs the question whether specific phenotypes associated with different foraging strategies and diets may constrain or facilitate egg recognition and rejection. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis that host species phenotypes related to foraging ecology and diet impose morphological and sensory constraints on the evolution of egg rejection. We conducted a comparative analysis of the adult diets and egg rejection rates of 165 current host and non-host species and found species that consume an animal and fruit dominated diet rather than seeds and grains, forage arboreally rather than aerially, and possess relatively larger body sizes have significantly higher egg rejection rates. As predicted, these results suggest that phenotypes related to specific diets and foraging strategies may differentially constrain or facilitate evolution of host egg rejection defenses against avian brood parasitism.",752,204,265,14.0

However, whether conspecifics pay attention to facial masculinity has only been assessed in humans. In a study of free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, we used a two-alternative look-time experiment to test whether females perceive male facial masculinity. We presented 107 females with pairs of images of male faces – one with a more masculine shape and one more feminine – and recorded their looking behaviour. Females looked at the masculine face longer than at the feminine face in more trials than predicted by chance. Although there was no overall difference in average look-time between masculine and feminine faces across all trials, females looked significantly longer at masculine faces in a subset of trials for which the within-pair difference in masculinity was most pronounced. Additionally, the proportion of time subjects looked toward the masculine face increased as the within-pair difference in masculinity increased. This study provides evidence that female macaques perceive variation in male facial shape, a necessary condition for intersexual selection to operate on such a trait.

People rate the quality of a new salary relative to their previous salary and the salaries of their peers, instead of appreciating its absolute value. Here, we demonstrate a similar effect in an insect: ants, which had previously experienced a low quality food source, showed higher acceptance of medium quality food (e.g. 0.1M then 0.5M; positive contrast) than if they had received the medium food all along (e.g. 0.5M then 0.5M; control), and vice versa for high expectations. Further experiments demonstrate that these contrast effects arise from cognitive rather than mere sensory or pre-cognitive perceptual causes. Pheromone deposition also correlates with perceived reward value, and ants showed successive contrasts in their pheromone deposition. Relative value perception can therefore be expected to have strong effects not only on individual behaviour, but also on collective decision-making. Contrast effects were also social: the quality of food received from other ants affected the perceived value of food found later. Value judgement is a key element in decision making, and thus relative value perception will strongly influence how animals interact with their environment.",2043,496,526,21.0

Populations might migrate to specific sites outside of the breeding season, but individuals within populations may also exhibit different migration strategies. Young, unexperienced birds may take different routes, visit different sites, and time their annual cycle differently than adults. In turn, within groups of adult birds, there may be a division between the sexes whereby males and females migrate to different sites or, more commonly, at different times. We investigated differences in the migration strategies of male and female ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) from a breeding population in northeastern Germany. An important difference between the sexes was the much earlier leaving of the breeding place by the females compared to the males. The difference in the timing of departure was much more pronounced compared to most other raptor species. The other main difference between the male and female ospreys was the distance that the birds accumulated over the annual cycle, with males generally moving more while at the breeding ground compared with the non-breeding grounds, and the opposite in females. An exception to this observation was two males that migrated to the Iberian Peninsula, that covered longer distances during the non-breeding season. Consequently, individuals accumulated the same distances over the course of an annual cycle, regardless of sex or migration strategy. Unexpectedly, a difference in the timing of the annual cycle between the sexes occurred at the breeding grounds with females leaving 2 to 3 months before the males, long before the young had fledged. Because males migrated much faster and, unlike the females, did not make prolonged stops, their arrival times at the non-breeding grounds were not different. Return migration to the breeding grounds was very similar between the sexes, and even the two males that spent the non-breeding season on the Iberian Peninsula did not arrive before any of the other birds. Thus, a shorter migration distance is not necessarily associated with an advantage with respect to a timely return to the breeding grounds.",1032,177,476,19.0

Paulin",398479;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/398479,"Summary statement We developed a machine vision technique for markerless tracking of locomotion in the spider Dolomedes aquaticus. Gait analysis suggests that each pair of legs plays a specific role in locomotion. Because of their rigid exoskeleton with relatively simple joint mechanics, arthropods can provide useful models for studying the sensory-neural and mechanical design principles of agile animal locomotion. Gait analysis usually requires attaching markers or manually identifying reference points in video frames, which can be time consuming and inaccurate, especially with small animals. Here we describe a markerless motion capture technique and its application to gait analysis in the New Zealand semi-aquatic hunting spider, Dolomedes aquaticus. Our machine vision approach uses a model of the spider’s skeleton to infer the location of the centre of mass and the configuration of the skeleton in successive video frames. We found that stride length and frequency are correlated with running speed. Inter-limb coordination during the gait cycle suggests that different legs have specialized roles in locomotion. Phase relationships among the six hindmost legs exhibit an alternating tripod gait, as in hexapod insects. The middle two leg pairs appear to be primarily responsible for generating thrust, while the hind legs contribute more to stability. The front legs are not phase-coupled to the other legs and appear to be used as tactile probes during locomotion. Our machine vision approach has the potential to automate arthropod gait analysis, making it faster and easier. Our results indicate how specialization of limb function may contribute to locomotor efficiency and agility of a specialized hunting spider, and how arthropod design principles may contribute to developing efficient, agile legged robots.",701,228,302,33.0

Game theory is an important tool of behavioral ecology for analyzing evolutionary situations involving multiple individuals. However, game theory bypasses the details by which behavioral phenotypes are determined, taking the functional perspective straight from expected payoffs to predicted frequencies of behaviors. In contrast with optimization approaches, we identify that to use existing game theoretic models to predict HIREC effects, additional mechanistic details (or assumptions) will often be required. We illustrate this in relation to the hawk-dove game by showing that three different mechanisms, each of which support the same ESS prior to HIREC (fixed polymorphism, probabilistic choice, or cue dependency), can have a substantial effect on behavior (and success) following HIREC. Surprisingly, an increase in the value of resources can lead to a reduction in payoffs (and vice versa), both in the immediate- and long-term following HIREC. An increase in expected costs also increases expected payoffs. Along with these counter-intuitive findings, this work shows that simply understanding the behavioral payoffs of existing games is insufficient to make predictions about the effects of HIREC.It’s the little details that are vital.

Although MSR has been reported in mammals and birds, it is not known to occur in any other major taxon. A factor potentially limiting the ability to test for MSR is that the established assay for MSR, the mark test, shows an interpretation bias towards animals with the dexterity (or limbs) required to touch a mark. Here, we show that the cleaner wrasse fish, Labroides dimidiatus, passes through all phases of the mark test: (i) social reactions towards the reflection, (ii) repeated idiosyncratic behaviours towards the mirror (contingency testing), and (iii) frequent observation of their reflection. When subsequently provided with a coloured tag, individuals attempt to remove the mark in the presence of a mirror but show no response towards transparent marks, or to coloured marks in the absence of a mirror. This remarkable finding presents a challenge to our interpretation of the mark test – do we accept that these behavioural responses in the mark test, which are taken as evidence of self-recognition in other species, mean that fish are self-aware? Or do we conclude that these behavioural patterns have a basis in a cognitive process other than self-recognition? If the former, what does this mean for our understanding of animal intelligence?

Neophobia (i.e. fear of the ‘new’) is thought to be adaptive under natural conditions by limiting risks, but it is potentially maladapted in captivity, where there are no predators or novel foods. We reared juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) for six weeks at either high (50g/L) or low density (14g/L), assessed the extent of skin and eye darkening (two proxies of chronic stress), and exposed them to a novel object in an open-test arena, with and without cover, to assess the effects of density on neophobia and stress coping styles. Fish reared at high density were darker, more neophobic, less aggressive, less mobile and less likely to take risks than those reared at low density, and these effects were exacerbated when no cover was available. Thus, the reactive coping style shown by fish at high density was very different from the proactive coping style shown by fish at low density. Our findings provide novel insights into the plasticity of fish behaviour and the effects of aquaculture intensification on one of the world’s oldest farmed and most invasive fish, and highlight the importance of considering context. Crowding could have a positive effect on the welfare of tilapia by reducing aggressive behaviour, but it can also make fish chronically stressed and more fearful, which could make them less invasive.",809,120,271,29.0

This study uses a ‘flicker’ paradigm adapted for dynamic stimuli which allowed for both simple orientation changes and more complex trajectory changes. Participants were required to identify a moving rectangle which underwent one of these changes against a background of moving rectangles which did not. The results demonstrated that participants’ ability to correctly identify the target deteriorated with the presence of a visual mask and a larger number of distractor objects, consistent with findings in previous change blindness work.The study provides evidence that the flicker paradigm can be used to induce change blindness with dynamic stimuli, and that changes to predictable trajectories are detected or missed in the similar way as orientation changes.",844,122,300,24.0

Using this approach, we characterized the physiological and behavioral phenotypes of two peptides from the venom of predatory terebrid marine snails, teretoxins Tv1 from Terebra variegata and Tsu1.1 from Terebra subulata. Our results indicate that Tv1 and Tsu1.1 have distinct bioactivity. Tv1 (100 μM) had an antinociceptive effect in adult Drosophila using a thermal nociception assay to measure heat avoidance. Alternatively, Tsu1.1 (100 μM) increased food intake. These findings describe the first functional bioactivity of terebrid venom peptides in relation to pain and diet and indicate that Tv1 and Tsu1.1 may, respectively, act as antinociceptive and orexigenic agents.

Relative to the control group, adaptive training led to increases in metacognitive calibration (as assessed by Brier scores) which generalized both to untrained stimuli and an untrained task (recognition memory). Leveraging signal detection modeling we found that metacognitive improvements were driven both by changes in metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’/d’) and confidence level, and that later increases in metacognitive efficiency were positively mediated by earlier shifts in confidence.

The juveniles were exposed to different deep anesthesia times (4, 7, 10, 12, and 15 min) at 75 mg L-1; the longest safe deep anesthesia time under LED was 10 min. Finally, the juveniles were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CG), draining group (DG, drain), anesthetic group (AG, drain + MS-222 + aquaculture treatment); and non-anesthetic group (NAG, drain + aquaculture treatment). Plasma cortisol levels in the NAG, AG, DG, and CG groups were 38.739 ± 1.065 (highest), 25.083 ± 0.587, 28.644 ± 0.612, and 22.620 ± 0.836 ng mL-1 (lowest). The AG group showed significant differences in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and malondialdehyde activities, except for glutathione. HSP70, HSP90, GR1, and GR2 mRNA levels in the NAG group increased sharply in response to stressors. GR1 and GR2 mRNA levels in the AG group also increased significantly, whereas HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA levels showed no significant differences. Thus, MS-222 can reduce oxidative damage, stress reaction, and resistance to aquaculture treatment stresses in P. argenteus.",766,219,504,28.0

Therefore, misdirection of parental care can significantly lower a female’s fitness. Because of the maternal investment and increased survivorship to offspring from egg guarding, a brooding female should home to her nest site after being displaced a short distance and discriminate between her own eggs and eggs from other females. In this study, we experimentally tested, in the field, alternative hypotheses concerning homing ability and egg discrimination in a population of nesting western slimy salamanders (Plethodon albagula). Fourteen brooding females were displaced 1 m to the left or right of their nest sites (determined randomly) for the homing experiment. Furthermore, brooding females (n = 13) were presented with their own clutches, which were displaced 50 cm to the left or right (determined randomly), and unfamiliar egg clutches at their original nest sites. The females were released at an equal distance from both egg clutches. After 24 hours, 12 displaced females (86%) had returned to their own nest sites and were brooding their egg clutches. Also, after 24 hours, nine test females had returned to their own nest sites and were brooding the unfamiliar egg clutches. No control or test females were present at the other new nest site locations. Therefore, we suggest that brooding female P. albagula do home to their nest sites and exhibit indirect egg discrimination.",703,133,345,8.0

Laskowski",386714;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/386714,"Understanding how animal groups form and function is a major goal in behavioural ecology. Both genetic relatedness and familiarity among group mates have been shown to be key mediators of group composition. However, disentangling the two in most species is challenging as the most familiar individuals are often the most related, and vice versa. In order to gain a complete understanding of how individual interactions shape group behaviour it is crucial to understand the role each of this social relationship factors plays individually. To this end, we manipulated the level of familiarity among groups of the naturally clonal, and genetically identical fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) and monitored group behaviour in an open-field and when given the opportunity to forage. Contrary to our predictions, fish that were the most familiar with each other showed the highest levels of aggression. Additionally, fish that were less familiar with each other exhibited the highest group cohesion and took the longest to begin feeding, compared to the more familiar fish. These results suggest that familiarity may socially buffer individuals from the perception of risk in novel environments, such as is common in most behavioural tests designed to test group behaviour. Increases in aggression that are associated with increasing familiarity as shown here might be a mechanism by which fish maintain a fission-fusion society with important consequences for the patterns of associations in group living animals.",1130,138,497,26.0

When two opposing perturbations are presented alternately for the same physical movement, there is substantial interference, preventing any learning. However, when the same physical movement is associated with follow-through movements that differ for each perturbation, both skills can be learned. Here we show that when subjects perform the skill and only imagine the follow-through, substantial learning occurs. In contrast, without such motor imagery there was no learning. Therefore, motor imagery can have a profound effect on skill acquisition even when the imagery is not of the skill itself.

To gain a deeper understanding of the use and application of social network analysis, we systematically surveyed the literature and extracted information on publication trends from articles using social network analysis. We synthesize trends in social network research over time and highlight variation in the use of different aspects of social network analysis. Our primary finding highlights the increase in use of social network analysis over time and from this finding, we observed an increase in the number of review and methods of social network analysis. We also found that most studies included a relatively small number (median = 15, range = 4–1406) of individuals to generate social networks, while the number and type of social network metrics calculated in a given study varied zero to nine (median = 2, range 0–9). The type of data collection or the software programs used to analyze social network data have changed; SOCPROG and UCINET have been replaced by various R packages over time. Finally, we found strong taxonomic and conservation bias in the species studied using social network analysis. Most species studied using social networks are mammals (111/201, 55%) or birds (47/201, 23%) and the majority tend to be species of least concern (119/201, 59%). We highlight emerging trends in social network research that may be valuable for distinct groups of social network researchers: students new to social network analysis, experienced behavioural ecologists interested in using social network analysis, and advanced social network users interested in trends of social network research. In summary we address the temporal trends in social network publication practices, highlight potential bias in some of the ways we employ social network analysis, and provide recommendations for future research based on our findings.",2412,1654,1077,34.0

In the holding run, a worker holds a brood with her mandibles and carries it to the queen (holding run). After releasing it beside the queen, she hurries back to another brood (empty-handed run). To address the motivation for the brood-accumulation task, in this study, I observed these behaviors under experimental conditions. When workers performed the task in a situation that involved selection between their own and unfamiliar queens, they ran in significantly more restrictive ways during the holding run than during the empty-handed run. Hence, ‘holding’ represents a different motivational state than ‘empty-handed’. In a second experiment, the workers were suddenly presented with an unfamiliar floor during the task. Regardless of whether they were holding or empty-handed, their running traces on the familiar floor were simple, whereas on the unfamiliar floor they were more complex. These results show that holding workers would pay attention to the queen, exploiting cues on the floor to restrict their responses to the queen.",612,377,219,26.0

Endler",382051;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/382051,"Colour vision mediates ecologically relevant tasks for many animals, such as mate choice, foraging and predator avoidance. However, our understanding of animal colour perception is largely derived from human psychophysics, even though animal visual systems differ from our own. Behavioural tests of non-human animals are required to understand how colour signals are perceived by them.Here we introduce a novel test of colour vision in animals inspired by the Ishihara colour charts, which are widely used to identify human colour deficiencies. These charts consist of dots that vary in colour, brightness and size, and are designed so that a numeral or letter is distinguishable from distractor dots for humans with normal colour vision. In our method, distractor dots have a fixed chromaticity (hue and saturation) but vary in luminance. Animals can be trained to find single target dots that differ from distractor dots in chromaticity. We provide Matlab code for creating these stimuli, which can be modified for use with different animals.We demonstrate the success of this method with triggerfìsh, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, and highlight behavioural parameters that can be measured, including success of finding the target dot, time to detect dot and error rate. Triggerfìsh quickly learnt to select target dots that differed from distractors dots regardless of the particular hue or saturation, and proved to use acute colour vision. We measured discrimination thresholds by testing the detection of target colours that were of increasing colour distances (ΔS) from distractor dots in different directions of colour space. At least for some colours, thresholds indicated better discrimination than expected from the Receptor Noise Limited (RNL) model assuming 5% Weber fraction for the long-wavelength cone.This methodology seems to be highly effective because it resembles natural foraging behavior for the triggerfìsh and may well be adaptable to a range of other animals, including mammals, birds, bees and freshwater fish. Other questions may be addressed using this methodology, including luminance thresholds, sensory bias, effects of sensory noise in detection tasks, colour categorization and saliency.",1167,366,837,14.0

If movement patterns interfere with the acquisition of visual information, insects can actively adjust them to seek relevant cues. Alternatively, where multiple visual cues are available, an insect’s movements may influence how it perceives a scene. We show that the way a foraging bumblebee approaches a floral pattern could determine what it learns about the pattern. When trained to vertical bicoloured patterns, bumblebees consistently approached from below centre in order to land in the centre of the target where the reward was located. In subsequent tests, the bees preferred the colour of the lower half of the pattern that they predominantly faced during the approach and landing sequence. A predicted change of learning outcomes occurred when the contrast line was moved up or down off-centre: learned preferences again reflected relative frontal exposure to each colour during the approach, independent of the overall ratio of colours. This mechanism may underpin learning strategies in both simple and complex visual discriminations, highlighting that morphology and action patterns determines how animals solve sensory learning tasks. The deterministic effect of movement on visual learning may have substantially influenced the evolution of floral signals, particularly where plants depend on fine-scaled movements of pollinators on flowers.",853,307,286,30.0

In addition, behavioural analysis can provide insight on the molecular basis of nervous system development and function as demonstrated by genetic screens focused on behavioural phenotyping in some genetically tractable model organisms. The progress in building low-cost automated tracking setups, together with advances in computer vision machine learning have expanded the repertoire of organisms which are amenable to quantitative behavioural analysis. Here we used automated image-based tracking to extract behavioural features from an organism of great importance in understanding the evolution of chordates, the free swimming larval form of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis which has a compact and fully mapped nervous system composed of only 231 neurons. We analysed hundreds of videos of larvae and we extracted basic geometric and physical descriptors of larval behaviour. Most importantly, we used machine learning methods to create an objective ontology of behaviours for C. intestinalis larvae. We identified eleven behavioural modes using agglomerative clustering. This approach enabled us to produce a quantitative description of the basic larval behavioural repertoire. Furthermore, we tested the robustness of this repertoire by comparing different rearing conditions and ages. Using our pipeline for quantitative behavioural analysis, we successfully reproduced the known photoresponsive behaviour and the first demonstration to our knowledge that C. intestinalis larvae exhibit sensory arousal and thigmotaxis, both of which can be modulated by the anxiotropic drug modafinil. Remarkably, by comparing the behaviour between animals assayed individually or in small groups, we found that crowd size influences larval behaviour. This study shows that C. intestinalis larval behaviour can be broken down to a set of stereotyped behaviours that are used to different extents in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, it raises exciting possibilities such as mapping behaviour to specific neurons of this compact chordate nervous system and it paves the way for comparative quantitative behavioural studies as a means to reconstruct the evolution of behaviour, especially in the chordate lineage.",1028,330,661,44.0

Wong, Tak Pan Wong",379669;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/379669,"The hippocampus has been highly implicated in depression symptoms. Recent findings suggest that the expression and susceptibility of depression symptoms are related to the enhanced functioning of the hippocampus. We reasoned that hippocampal engrams, which represent ensembles of neurons with increased activity after memory formation, could underlie some contributions of the hippocampus to depression symptoms. Using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, we examined social defeat-related hippocampal engrams in mice that are either susceptible or resilient to the stressor. TetTag mice were used to label social defeat-related hippocampal ensembles by LacZ. Engram cells correspond to ensembles that were reactivated by the same stressor.Compared to resilient and non-stressed control mice, we found that in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions, susceptible mice exhibited a higher reactivation of social defeat-related LacZ-labeled cells (i.e. engram cells). The density of CA1 engram cells correlated with the level of social avoidance. Using DREADD to reactivate social defeat-related but not neutral contextual stimuli-related CA1 engram cells decreased social interaction. Increased engram cells in susceptible mice were region specific and could not be found in the dentate gyrus. Susceptible mice exhibited more negative stimuli-, but not neutral stimuli-, related CA1 engram cells than resilient mice in the dorsal hippocampus. Finally, chronic, but not a short and subthreshold, social defeat protocol was necessary to increase CA1 engram cell density. Together, our findings reveal that the susceptibility to CSDS is regulated by hippocampal CA1 engrams for negative memory. Hippocampal engrams for negative memory may underlie the vulnerability and expression of cognitive symptoms in depression.Significance statement We provided evidence that negative memory hippocampal engrams contribute to the susceptibility to developing depression-related behavior after chronic social defeat stress. The activation of positive memory engrams have been shown to alleviate depression-related behaviors, while our findings reveal the pathological roles of negative memory engrams that could lead to those behaviors. Increased negative memory engrams could be a downstream effect of the reported high hippocampal activity in animal models and patients with depression. Unlike affective symptoms, we know much less about the cellular mechanisms of the cognitive symptoms of depression. Given the crucial roles of hippocampal engrams in memory formation, enhanced reactivation of negative memory engrams could be an important cellular mechanism that underlies the cognitive symptoms of depression.",1800,261,761,45.0

Kohn,380642;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/380642,"Pair bonds are often maintained through the reciprocal and coordinated exchange of communicative signals. The ability to recognize and appropriately respond to a partner’s signals will define a pair’s ability to reproduce. Individual variation in responsiveness, by shaping the formation and maintenance of strong pair bonds, will ultimately influence an individual’s reproductive output. Throughout the breeding period, female cowbirds (Molothrus ater) respond to male song displays using a vocalization known as the chatter. In this study, we investigated whether variation in chatters remained repeatable across years and predicted reproductive performance. A flock of cowbirds housed in a large aviary complex was observed during the spring of 2011 to 2012. We recorded courtship interactions, including singing behavior for males, and chatters and eggs laid by females. The rate with which females responded to song using chatters remained consistent across years, with some females predictably responding to more songs using chatters than others. During 2012, chattering predicted the number of eggs females laid and her paired status. Paired females were more likely to respond to songs with chatters, and there was a strong positive relationship between the number of eggs laid and the proportion of songs she responded to using chatters. Overall, these findings suggest that individual variation in female vocal responsiveness is an important contributing factor to cowbird reproductive success.",794,92,216,29.0

The development of rodent models is imperative for investigating the underlying changes behind these pathological states. However, past attempts have failed to produce drinking outcomes similar to those reported in humans. In the present study, we investigated whether hind paw treatment with the inflammatory agent Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) could generate hyperalgesia and alter alcohol consumption in male and female C57BL/6J mice. CFA treatment led to greater nociceptive sensitivity for both sexes in the Hargreaves test, and increased alcohol drinking for males in a continuous access two-bottle choice (CA2BC) paradigm. Regardless of treatment, female mice exhibited greater alcohol drinking than males. Following a 2-hour terminal drinking session, CFA treatment failed to produce changes in alcohol drinking, blood ethanol concentration (BEC), and plasma corticosterone (CORT) for both sexes. 2-hr alcohol consumption and CORT was higher in females than males, irrespective of CFA treatment. Taken together, these findings have established that male mice are more susceptible to escalations in alcohol drinking when undergoing pain, despite higher levels of total alcohol drinking and CORT in females. Furthermore, the exposure of CFA-treated C57BL/6J mice to the CA2BC drinking paradigm has proven to be a useful model for studying the relationship between chronic pain and alcohol abuse. Future applications of the CFA/CA2BC model should incorporate manipulations of stress signaling and other related biological systems to improve our mechanistic understanding of pain and alcohol interactions.",1295,143,443,17.0

In locusts, intra- as well as inter-phase reproductive interactions among gregarious and solitarious locust populations have a major impact on the locust population dynamics. However, practically all previous work on locust sexual behavior has been limited to the gregarious phase. Here we provide a first detailed description of pre-copulatory behavior of solitarious desert locusts. We compare our findings with those of previous reports of pre-copulatory behavior of gregarious locusts, focusing on the behavioral elements that serve in inter-sex signaling and communication. We also studied inter-phase (mixed pairs) reproductive interactions. Solitarious males were found to invest more in pre-copulatory courtship and signaling compared to their gregarious counterparts; and the solitarious females played a comparatively more dominant role in the inter-sex communication. The solitarious females were also less prone to demonstrate the typical rejection-related behavioral patterns displayed by the gregarious females. As a consequence of the particular characteristic behavior of each phase, the most successful among intra- and inter-phase pairs were gregarious males with solitary females. Least successful were solitary males encountered with gregarious females, indicating a strong asymmetry in inter-phase reproductive interactions.

Frank,341305;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/341305,"The universal law of generalization describes how animals discriminate between alternative sensory stimuli. On an appropriate perceptual scale, the probability that an organism perceives two stimuli as similar typically declines exponentially with the difference on the perceptual scale. Exceptions often follow a Gaussian probability pattern rather than an exponential pattern. Previous explanations have been based on underlying theoretical frameworks such as information theory, Kolmogorov complexity, or empirical multidimensional scaling. This article shows that the few inevitable invariances that must apply to any reasonable perceptual scale provide a sufficient explanation for the universal exponential law of generalization. In particular, reasonable measurement scales of perception must be invariant to shift by a constant value, which by itself leads to the exponential form. Similarly, reasonable measurement scales of perception must be invariant to multiplication, or stretch, by a constant value, which leads to the conservation of the slope of discrimination with perceptual difference. In some cases, an additional assumption about exchangeability or rotation of underlying perceptual dimensions leads to a Gaussian pattern of discrimination, which can be understood as a special case of the more general exponential form. The three measurement invariances of shift, stretch, and rotation provide a sufficient explanation for the universally observed patterns of perceptual generalization. All of the additional assumptions and language associated with information, complexity, and empirical scaling are superfluous with regard to the broad patterns of perception.",1556,157,453,6.0

We aimed to examine individual variation in caching and spatial memory between and within urban and rural habitats to determine i) whether urban individuals cache less frequently and perform less accurately on a spatial task, and ii) explore, for the first time in scatter hoarders, whether slower explorers perform more accurately on a spatial task, indicating a speed-accuracy trade-off within individuals. We assessed spatial memory of wild-caught black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; N = 96) from 14 sites along an urban gradient.

Our analyses revealed no compelling evidence that women with more attractive faces or lower (i.e., more attractive) waist-to-hip ratios had higher levels of estradiol or progesterone. One analysis did suggest that women with more attractive waist-to-hip ratios had significantly higher progesterone, but the relationship was weak and the relationship not significant in other analyses. These results do not support the influential hypothesis that between-women differences in physical attractiveness are related to estradiol and/or progesterone.",7472,378,1881,16.0

The excretory system must be coordinated with other behaviors in insects. We found that crickets start walking forward following excretion of feces. Most intact crickets walked around the experimental arena, stopped at a particular site and raised up their body with a slight backward drift to excrete feces. After the feces dropped on the floor, the animal started walking with a random gait pattern away from the feces, and then changed the gait pattern to a tripod gait. Headless cricket also showed walking following excretion. In more than half of excretion events, headless crickets walked backward before excretion. The posture adopted during excretion was similar to that of intact crickets, and post-excretory forward walking was also observed. The occurrence rate of post-excretory walking was more than that of intact crickets. The gait pattern during forward walking was random and never transitioned to a tripod gait in the headless crickets. In animals whose abdominal nerve cords were cut, in any position, pre- or post-excretion walking was not shown in both intact and headless crickets, although they excreted feces. These results indicate that ascending signals from the terminal abdominal ganglion initiate leg movement through the neuronal circuits within thoracic ganglia, and that descending signals from the brain must regulate leg the motor circuit to express the appropriate walking gait.",2221,312,450,25.0

In this study, we showed that semiochemical conditions during Aedes aegypti larval rearing affected future female choice for oviposition: water-reared mosquitoes preferred to lay eggs in water or p-cresol containers, while skatole reared mosquitoes preferred skatole sites. Using two independent behavioural assays, we showed that this skatole preference was lost in mosquitoes infected with dengue virus. Viral RNA was extracted from infected female mosquito heads, and an increase of virus load was detected from 3 to 10 days post infection, indicating replication in the insect head and possibly in the central nervous system. Expression of selected genes, potentially implied in olfactory learning processes, were also altered during dengue infection. Based on these results, we hypothesise that dengue virus infection alters gene expression in the mosquito’s head and is associated with a loss of olfactory preferences, possibly modifying oviposition site choice of female mosquitoes.",848,116,274,31.0

Pet dogs are known to have social skills and abilities to display situation-specific responses, but there is lack of information regarding free-ranging dogs which constitute majority of the world’s dog population. Free-ranging dogs found in most of the developing countries interact constantly with familiar and unfamiliar humans receiving both positive and negative behavior. Thus, understanding human intentions and subsequent behavioral adjustments are crucial for dogs that share habitats with humans. Here we subjected free-ranging dogs to different human social communicative cues (friendly and threatening – low and high), followed by a food provisioning phase and tested their responsiveness. Dogs exhibited higher proximity seeking behavior as a reaction to friendly gesture whereas, they were prompted to maintain distance depending on the impact of the threatening cues. Interestingly, only the high-impact threatening showed to have a persistent effect which also remained during the subsequent food provisioning phase. An elevated approach in the food provisioning phase elicited the dependency of free-ranging dogs on humans for sustenance. Our findings suggest that free-ranging dogs demonstrate behavioral plasticity on interacting with humans; which provides significant insights into the establishment of the dog-human relationship on streets.",1246,145,2079,19.0

Chockley, Ansgar Büschges",374272;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/374272,"During walking, insects must coordinate the movements of their six legs for efficient locomotion. This interleg coordination is speed-dependent; fast walking in insects is associated with tripod coordination patterns, while slow walking is associated with more variable, tetrapod-like patterns. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive explanation as to why these speed-dependent shifts in interleg coordination should occur in insects. Tripod coordination would be sufficient at low walking speeds. The fact that insects use a different interleg coordination pattern at lower speeds suggests that it is more optimal or advantageous at these speeds. Furthermore, previous studies focused on discrete tripod and tetrapod coordination patterns. Experimental data, however, suggest that changes observed in interleg coordination are part of a speed-dependent spectrum. Here, we explore these issues in relation to static stability as an important aspect of interleg coordination in Drosophila. We created a model that uses basic experimentally measured parameters in fruit flies to find the interleg phase relationships that maximize stability for a given walking speed. Based on this measure, the model predicted a continuum of interleg coordination patterns spanning the complete range of walking speeds. Furthermore, for low walking speeds the model predicted tetrapod-like patterns to be most stable, while at high walking speeds tripod coordination emerged as most optimal. Finally, we validated the basic assumption of a continuum of interleg coordination patterns in a large set of experimental data from walking fruit flies and compared these data with the model-based predictions.Summary statement A simple stability-based modelling approach can explain why walking insects use different leg coordination patterns in a speed-dependent way.",1011,207,296,33.0

For video-based assays, this is often accomplished by manipulating environmental conditions to increase contrast between the animal and the background, in order to achieve proper foreground/background detection (segmentation). However, as behavioral paradigms become more sophisticated with ethologically relevant environments, the approach of modifying environmental conditions offers diminishing returns, particularly for scalable experiments. Currently, there is a need for methods to monitor behaviors over long periods of time, under dynamic environmental conditions, and in animals that are genetically and behaviorally heterogeneous. To address this need, we developed a state-of-the-art neural network-based tracker for mice, using modern machine vision techniques. We test three different neural network architectures to determine their performance on genetically diverse mice under varying environmental conditions. We find that an encoder-decoder segmentation neural network achieves high accuracy and speed with minimal training data. Furthermore, we provide a labeling interface, labeled training data, tuned hyperparameters, and a pre-trained network for the mouse behavior and neuroscience communities. This general-purpose neural network tracker can be easily extended to other experimental paradigms and even to other animals, through transfer learning, thus providing a robust, generalizable solution for biobehavioral research.",1249,234,804,26.0

By compensating for the care provided by helpers, breeders can reduce the costs of reproduction and improve chances of survival. Also, helper care can be additive to that of dominants, resulting in higher success of the current brood.However, the influence of helpers on offspring care itself may be the by-product of group size and territory quality. Therefore to make conclusive inferences about causation of additive and compensatory care as a result of help per se requires disentangling the impact of helping from other factors determining parental investment.In this study, we use 20 years of offspring provisioning data to investigate the effect of helping on breeder and overall offspring provisioning rates in the facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). Our extensive dataset allowed us to effectively control for the effects of living in a larger group and in territories with higher food availability.We show compensatory and additive care in response to helper aid. Helpers lightened the provisioning load of the dominant male and female and increased the total provisioning to the nestlings. This was irrespective of group size or territory quality (food availability).Our results illustrate how multiple benefits of helping behaviour can simultaneously be fundamental to the evolutionary maintenance of cooperative behaviour.",887,124,289,22.0

Changes in environmental conditions induced workers to quickly transport the brood to a preferred location. Only a minority of the workers, mainly nurses, participated in this task. Using a large number of statistical tests we could further show that these transporters omitted to recruit help, and relied only on private information rather than information obtained from other workers. This reveals that synchronised group behaviour, often suggestive of coordinated actions among workers, can also occur in the complete absence of communication.",1412,400,577,28.0

Workers of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) exhibit individual variation in exploratory behavior, which affects the colony’s collective nest selection behavior. Here we examine the mechanisms underlying this behavioral variation in exploratory behavior and determine its implications for the ecology of this species. We first establish that individual variation in exploratory behavior is repeatable and consistent across situations. We then show a relationship between exploratory behavior and the expression of genes that have been previously linked with other behaviors in social insects. Specifically, we find a negative relationship between exploratory behavior and the expression of the FOR gene. Finally, we determine how colonies allocate exploratory individuals in natural conditions. We find that ants from inside the nest are the least exploratory individuals, while workers on newly formed foraging trails are the most exploratory individuals. Furthermore, workers in the spring, when new resources emerge, are more exploratory than workers in the winter, potentially allowing the colony to find and exploit new resources. These findings reveal the importance of individual variation in behavior for the ecology of social animals and provide mechanistic and functional explanations for how such behavioral variation can emerge.",763,129,300,26.0

Neurocognitive aging models suggest that the aged memory system is biased toward pattern completion, resulting in a behavioral preference for retrieval over encoding of memories. While there are behavioral tasks to assess the encoding side of these memory differences, pattern completion has received less attention in the literature. Here, we built on our previously developed behavioral recognition memory paradigm – the Memory Image Completion task (MIC) – a task to specifically target pattern completion. First, we used the original design with concurrent eye-tracking in order to rule out perceptual confounds that could interact with recognition performance. Second, we developed parallel versions of the task to accommodate test settings in clinical environments or longitudinal studies. The results show that older adults have a deficit in pattern completion ability with a concurrent bias toward pattern completion – a replication of previously found effects. Importantly, eye-tracking data during encoding could not account for age-related performance differences. At retrieval, spatial viewing patterns for both age groups were more driven by stimulus identity than by response choice, but compared to young adults, older adults’ fixation patterns overlapped more between stimuli that they (wrongly) thought had the same identity. This supports the observation that when making errors older adults choose responses perceived as similar to the correct stimulus, which is interpreted as a bias toward pattern completion. Additionally, two shorter versions of the task yielded comparable results, and no general learning effects were observed for repeated testing. Together, we present evidence that the MIC is a reliable behavioral task that targets pattern completion, that is easily and repeatedly applicable, and that is made freely available online.",1171,127,396,37.0

There is variation, however, in the range of social cues that will initiate a hormone response in the receiver of social signals. We investigate whether social cues modify activity within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and the specificity of this response in a social parasite that is known to eavesdrop on the communication signals of other species: the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Brown-headed cowbirds are obligate brood parasites that do not build nests or care for their own young. Instead, obligate brood parasites always leave their eggs in the nest of a host species thereby receiving the benefits of parental care toward offspring without paying any of the costs. Thus, social parasites must coordinate their breeding attempts with conspecifics as well as potential heterospecific hosts and therefore, social parasites such as cowbirds rely on the communication signals of host species to help locate nests to parasitize during the breeding season. Here, we explore whether the vocal signals of potential host species can also be used as a social cue that modifies the HPG axis of female brown-headed cowbirds. Results reveal that both conspecific and heterospecific song-exposed females exhibit significantly greater circulating estradiol concentrations as compared to silence-exposed females. While conspecific song induces the greatest elevation in circulating estradiol, there is no significant difference in circulating estradiol levels in females exposed to either conspecific or heterospecific songs. This pattern suggests both song types are effective at evoking a reproductive physiological response. On the other hand, circulating progesterone concentrations did not differ among the song- and silence-exposed groups nor did the size of the female’s ovarian follicles. These results indicate that heterospecific vocal communication signals can effectively be used as a social cue that simultaneously provides necessary information regarding breeding status of hosts and modifies breeding condition of the eavesdropper.HighlightsBrood parasites may coordinate reproductive attempts with potential hosts.Therefore, parasites eavesdrop on other species, which helps them find nests.Vocal signals from conspecific and heterospecifics elevate estrogen in parasites.Hearing potential host songs may enhance reproductive hormones in brood parasites.",769,208,229,12.0

Previous studies examined behavioral reactions to single gestures and sequences, but whether this complexity is associated with more complex sociality at the level of the dyad partner and the group as a whole is not well understood. We used social network analysis to examine how the production of single gestures and sequences of gestures was related to the duration of time spent in proximity and individual differences in proximity in wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Pairs of chimpanzees that spent a longer duration of time in proximity had higher rates of persistence, but not a higher rate of single gesture or rapid sequences.

Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides and affix in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the fly nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes.

Existing models of human preferences generally assume these preferences to be fixed. However, human assessment of facial attractiveness have been found to be highly context-dependent. Specifically, the classical Beauty-in-Averageness (BiA) effect, whereby a face blended from two original faces is judged to be more attractive than the originals, is significantly diminished or reversed when the original faces are recognizable, or when the morph is mixed-race/mixed gender and the attractiveness judgment is preceded by a race/gender categorization. This effect, dubbed Ugliness-in-Averageness (UiA), has previously been attributed to a disfluency account, which is both qualitative and clumsy in explaining BiA. We hypothesize, instead, that these contextual influences on face processing result from the dependence of attractiveness perception on an element of statistical typicality, and from an attentional mechanism that restricts face representation to a task-relevant subset of features, thus redefining typicality within that subspace. Furthermore, we propose a principled explanation of why statistically atypical objects are less likable: they incur greater encoding or processing cost associated with a greater prediction error, when the brain uses predictive coding to compare the actual stimulus properties with those expected from its associated categorical prototype. We use simulations to show our model provides a parsimonious, statistically grounded, and quantitative account of contextual dependence of attractiveness. We also validate our model using experimental data from a gender categorization task.

Humans readily infer social traits (e.g. attractiveness and trustworthiness) from a stranger’s face. Previous attempts to characterize the facial (physiognomic) features underlying social processing have lacked either systematicity or interpretability. Here, we utilize a statistical framework to tackle this problem, by learning a vector space to represent faces, and a linear mapping from this face space into human social trait judgments. Specifically, we obtain a face space by training the Active Appearance Model on large datasets of face images. Based on human evaluations of numerous social traits on these images, we then use regression to find linear combinations of facial features (what we call Linear Trait Axis, or LTA) that best predict human social judgments. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in overall predictive accuracy – comparable to the best convolutional neural network and better than human prediction of other human ratings. To interpret the LTAs, we regress them against a large repertoire of geometric features. To understand the relationship between the facial features that underlie different social, emotional, and demographic traits, we present a novel “dual space analysis” that characterizes the geometric relationship among LTA vectors. It shows that facial features important for social trait perception are largely distinct from those underlying demographic and emotion perception, contrary to previous suggestions that social trait perception is driven by over-generalization of relatively primitive demographic and emotion perception processes. In addition, we present a novel correlation decomposition analysis that quantifies how correlations in trait judgments (e.g. between attractiveness and babyfacedness) independently arise from (1) shared facial features among traits, and (2) correlation in the distribution of facial features in the human population.",1413,200,1002,10.0

We used the social defeat-induced persistent stress (SDPS) model of chronic depression in combination with operant alcohol self-administration (SA). Male Wistar rats were subjected to social defeat (5 episodes) and prolonged social isolation (~12 weeks) and subsequently classified as SDPS-prone or SDPS-resilient based on their affective and cognitive performance. Using an operant alcohol SA paradigm, acquisition, motivation, extinction and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking were examined in the two subpopulations. SDPS-prone animals showed increased alcohol SA, excessive motivation to acquire alcohol, persistent alcohol-seeking despite alcohol unavailability, extinction resistance and increased cue-induced relapse; the latter could be blocked by the α2 adrenoreceptor agonist guanfacine. In SDPS-resilient rats, prior exposure to social defeat increased alcohol SA without affecting any other measures of alcohol-seeking and -taking. Our data revealed that depression proneness confers vulnerability to alcohol, emulating patterns of alcohol dependence seen in human addicts, and that depression resilience to a large extent protects from the development of AUD-like phenotypes.

Yet relatively little is known about how these beneficial associations initially arose. We investigated this problem with an experiment on burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides, which breed on the body of a small dead vertebrate. We found that burying beetles breeding on germ-free mice produced smaller larvae, with lower fitness, than those breeding on conventional germ-laden mice. Thus, burying beetles gain benefits from the microbial community associated with their carrion breeding resource, because they lose fitness when this community is removed experimentally. Our experiment suggests that a symbiosis between an animal and a microbial community might begin as an adaptation to the microbial ecosystem in which the animal lives, even when these microbes exist outside the animal, are transiently associated with it at each generation and are not directly transmitted from parents to offspring.",1010,132,347,12.0

Endler, Gemma L. Cole, Alexandrea Kranz",342063;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/342063,"Colour patterns are used by many species to make decisions that ultimately affect their Darwinian fitness. Colour patterns consist of a mosaic of patches that differ in geometry and visual properties. Although traditionally pattern geometry and colour patch visual properties are analysed separately, these components are likely to work together as a functional unit. Despite this, the combined effect of patch visual properties, patch geometry, and the effects of the patch boundaries on animal visual systems, behaviour and fitness are relatively unexplored. Here we describe Boundary Strength Analysis (BSA), a novel way to combine the geometry of the edges (boundaries among the patch classes) with the receptor noise estimate (ΔS) of the intensity of the edges. The method is based upon known properties of vertebrate and invertebrate retinas. The mean and SD of ΔS (mΔS, sΔS) of a colour pattern can be obtained by weighting each edge class ΔS by its length, separately for chromatic and achromatic ΔS. This assumes those colour patterns, or parts of the patterns used in signalling, with larger mΔS and sΔS are more stimulating and hence more salient to the viewers. BSA can be used to examine both colour patterns and visual backgrounds. BSA was successful in assessing the estimated conspicuousness of colour pattern variants in two species, guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae), both polymorphic for patch colour, luminance and geometry. The pattern difference between chromatic and achromatic edges in both species reveals the possibility that chromatic and achromatic edges could function differently. BSA can be applied to any colour pattern used in intraspecific and interspecific behaviour. Seven predictions and four questions about colour patterns are presented.",1146,503,570,37.0

Weitz",268268;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/268268,"Collective action dilemmas pervade the social and biological sciences - from human decision-making to bacterial quorum sensing. In these scenarios, individuals sense cues from the environment to adopt a suitable phenotype or change in behavior. However, when cues include signals from other individuals, then the appropriate behavior of each individual is linked. Here, we develop a framework to quantify the influence of information sharing on individual behavior in the context of two player coordination games. In this framework, the environment stochastically switches between two states, and the state determines which one of two actions players must coordinate on. Given a stochastically switching environment, we then consider two versions of the game that differ in the way players acquire information. In the first model, players independently sense private environmental cues, but do not communicate with each other. We find there are two types of strategies that emerge as Nash equilibria and fitness maximizers - players prefer to commit to one particular action when private information is poor, or prefer to employ phenotypic plasticity when it is good. The second model adds an additional layer of communication, where players share social cues as well. When the quality of social information is high, we find the socially optimal strategy is a novel “majority logic” strategy that bases decision-making on social cues. Our game-theoretic approach offers a principled way of investigating the role of communication in group decision-making under uncertain conditions.",1796,148,655,17.0

The acoustic masking hypothesis states that auditory masking may occur if the target sound and interfering sounds overlap spectrally, and it suggests that animals exposed to noise will modify their acoustic signals to increase signal detectability. However, it is unclear if animals will put more effort into changing their signals that spectrally overlap more with the interfering sounds than when the signals overlap less. We examined the dynamic changes in the temporal features of echolocation and communication vocalizations of the Asian particolored bat (Vespertilio sinensis) when exposed to traffic noise. We hypothesized that traffic noise has a greater impact on communication vocalizations than on echolocation vocalizations and predicted that communication vocalization change would be greater than echolocation. The bats started to adjust echolocation vocalizations on the fourth day of noise exposure, including an increased number of call sequences, decreased number of calls, and vocal rate within a call sequence. However, there was little change in the duration of the call sequence. In contrast, these communication vocalization features were not significantly adjusted under noise conditions. These findings suggest that the degree of spectral overlap between noise and animal acoustic signals does not predict the level of temporal vocal response to the noise.",1005,313,574,28.0

However, their assumption that body size would always change ahead of brain size is open to question. In addition, many of their datapoints are confounded by grade shift effects. A reanalysis of their data controlling for these confounds shows that there is in fact a strong lag effect, but that the direction of the lag is the reverse of that originally assumed: brain size typically changes first, and does so under selection from changes in group size. The data suggest that it takes about 2.0 million years for body size to converge back onto the conventional allometric relationship with brain size. In the meantime, species that have increased brain size are likely to incur a significant energy cost that must be met from elsewhere.

We discovered that prawns occupy horizontal surfaces more frequently than others, but during pre-molt and molt stages, they shift their habitat use to non-horizontally sloped surfaces. Here, they will flex their shell and later molt. We recommend modification of cannibalism management in commercial facilities by providing sufficient vertical (strongly preferred) or high-sloped (greater than 30 degrees) surfaces to facilitate ecdysis, while providing much horizontal space for foraging and other activities. This should create habitat separation between foraging and highly susceptible freshly-molted prawns, thus leading to reduced cannibalism-related mortality.Funding This work was supported by the USDA Evans Allen Program at Langston University, Project Number USDA-NIFA-OKLUMCCALLUM2017.Disclosure statement We acknowledge that there is no financial interest or benefit that has arisen from the direct applications of our research.",876,215,369,6.0

We used an intermittent, limited access BE paradigm involving sweetened palatable food (PF) to examine genetic differences in BE, conditioned food reward, and compulsive-like eating between C57BL/6J (B6J) and DBA/2J (D2J) inbred mouse strains. D2J mice showed a robust escalation in intake and conditioned place preference for the PF-paired side. D2J mice also showed a unique style of compulsive-like eating in the light/dark conflict test where they rapidly hoarded and consumed PF in the preferred unlit environment. BE and compulsive-like eating exhibited narrow-sense heritability estimates between 56 and 73 percent. To gain insight into the genetic basis, we phenotyped and genotyped a small cohort of 133 B6J × D2J-F2 mice at the peak location of three quantitative trait loci (QTL) previously identified in F2 mice for sweet taste (chromosome 4: 156 Mb), bitter taste (chromosome 6: 133 Mb) and behavioral sensitivity to drugs of abuse (chromosome 11: 50 Mb). The D2J allele on chromosome 6 was associated with greater PF intake on training days and greater compulsive-like PF intake, but only in males, suggesting that decreased bitter taste may increase BE in males. The D2J allele on chromosome 11 was associated with an increase in final PF intake and slope of escalation across days.

Here we present a novel worm tracking toolbox based on the FIM (Frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) based Imaging Method) system incorporating a variety of different behavioural assays into a single imaging and tracking setup.First, we apply the FTIR-based imaging method to C. elegans, thus we are able to improve the overall image quality compared to state of the art recording techniques.

Second, we extended the existing FIMTrack software to extract skeleton-based posture and motion features of multiple worms with very high accuracy in a comparatively large field-of-view. Third, we integrated a variety of different assays into this system. We carried out chemotaxis assays both with attractant and repellent chemicals. A novel electrotaxis dome compatible with FIM allows locomotion analyses that are not corrupted by random aberrations in unrestricted movement. Additionally, the FIM based worm tracker is able to analyse thrashing behaviour of multiple worms automatically with a high accuracy.

Here we use a well-known orientation estimation task to frame the human recency bias in terms of incremental Bayesian inference. We show that the only Bayesian model capable of explaining the recency bias relies on a weighted mixture of past states.

Here we develop new adaptive stimulus selection methods for flexible PF models in tasks with two or more alternatives. We model the PF with a multinomial logistic regression mixture model that incorporates realistic aspects of psychophysical behavior, including lapses and multiple alternatives for the response. We propose an information-theoretic criterion for stimulus selection and develop computationally efficient methods for inference and stimulus selection based on semi-adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We apply these methods to data from macaque monkeys performing a multi-alternative motion discrimination task, and show in simulated experiments that our method can achieve a substantial speed-up over random designs.

In contrast, habitual tool use and stone-tool use by Sapajus is widespread. We discuss factors which might explain these differences in patterns of tool use between Cebus and Sapajus. We then report the first case of habitual stone-tool use in a gracile capuchin: a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Coiba National Park, Panama who habitually rely on hammerstone and anvil tool use to access structurally protected food items in coastal areas including Terminalia catappa seeds, hermit crabs, marine snails, terrestrial crabs, and other items. This behavior has persisted on one island in Coiba National Park since at least 2004. From one year of camera trapping, we found that stone tool use is strongly male-biased. Of the 205 unique camera-trap-days where tool use was recorded, adult females were never observed to use stone-tools, although they were frequently recorded at the sites and engaged in scrounging behavior. Stone-tool use occurs year-round in this population, and over half of all identifiable individuals were observed participating. At the most active tool use site, 83.2% of days where capuchins were sighted corresponded with tool use. Capuchins inhabiting the Coiba archipelago are highly terrestrial, under decreased predation pressure and potentially experience resource limitation compared to mainland populations– three conditions considered important for the evolution of stone tool use.

However, two major methodological differences hinder comparing results across species. Human studies present long time-horizon options verbally, whereas animal studies employ experiential cues and short delays. To bridge these divides, we developed a novel language-free experiential task inspired by animal decision-making studies. We find that subjects’ time-preferences are reliable across both verbal/experiential differences and also second/day differences. When we examined whether discount factors shifted or scaled across the tasks, we found a surprisingly strong effect of temporal context.

Our experiment manipulated participants’ experience of the predictiveness of different stimuli over the course of trial-by-trial training; we then provided explicit verbal instructions regarding stimulus predictiveness that were designed to be either consistent or inconsistent with the previously established learned predictiveness. The effects of training and instruction on attention to stimuli were measured using a dot probe task. Results revealed a rapid attentional bias towards stimuli experienced as predictive (versus those experienced as nonpredictive), that was completely unaffected by verbal instructions. This was not due to participants’ failure to recall or use instructions appropriately, as revealed by analyses of their learning about stimuli, and their memory for instructions. Overall, these findings suggest that stimuli experienced as predictive through trial-by-trial training produce a relatively inflexible attentional bias based on prior selection history, which is not (always) easily altered through instructions.",718,84,214,34.0

Using CRISPR-Cas9 we then targeted for knockout 35 genes associated with autism and schizophrenia. We found mutations in three genes had distinctive effects on the amount of time spent in the specific states or transitions between states. Mutation in immp2l (inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase 2-like gene) enhances states of cohesion, so increases shoaling; mutation in in the Nav1.1 sodium channel, scn1lab+/− causes the fish to remain scattered without evident social interaction; and mutation in the adrenergic receptor, adra1aa−/−, keeps fish close together and retards transitions between states, leaving fish motionless for long periods. Motor and visual functions seemed relatively well-preserved. This work shows that the behaviors of fish engaged in collective activities are built from a set of stereotypical states. Single gene mutations can alter propensities to collective actions by changing the proportion of time spent in these states or the tendency to transition between states.

In a behavioral assay that excluded tactile and chemical cues, we tested if spiders distinguish the three ants by visual cues alone. We recorded and analysed behaviors such as ‘look’, ‘approach’, ‘stalk’, ‘attack’, and ‘avoidance’ by spiders towards ants. Our results show that the three ants differ in their color, movement and aggressive behavior. Spiders gave ‘short looks’ to live ants, suggesting movement is important in detecting ants. Furthermore, spiders gave significantly more ‘long looks’ to procession and golden-back ants compared to weaver ants. Spiders approached, stalked and attacked procession ants more compared to weaver ants. Numerous jumping spiders and ants overlap in their habitat, and it is advantageous to selectively avoid some ants over others. Our results suggests that jumping spiders can indeed distinguish ants that co-occur in their habitat by visual cues alone, however, the precise nature of visual cues warrants further studies.",1052,412,519,27.0

Our analyses focused on gene expression changes specifically in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region known to play a critical role in maternal behavior across vertebrates. Using comparative transcriptomic approaches, we identified gene expression patterns associated with brood parasitism and evaluated two alternative explanations for the evolution of brood parasitism: reduced expression of parental-related genes in the POA versus retention of juvenile (neotenic) gene expression. While we did not find evidence for large scale gene downregulation, expression patterns did reflect substantial evidence for neotenic POA gene expression in parasitic birds. Differentially expressed genes with previously established roles in parental care were identified. Targeted examination of these selected candidate genes in additional hypothalamic regions revealed species differences in gene expression patterns is not POA-specific. Together, these results provide new insights into neurogenomics underlying maternal behavior loss in avian brood parasites.",1528,242,456,39.0

Specifically, we measured the amount and type of covering material on each urchin, and, in several cases, the recovery of debris cover after stripping the animal of its cover.We found that Tripneustes gratilla and Salmacis sphaeroides have a higher preference for plant material, especially sea-grass, compared to Pseudoboletia maculata and Toxopneutes pileolus, which prefer to cover themselves with coral rubble and other calcified material. Only for Toxopneutes pileolus did we find a decrease in cover with depth, confirming previous work that the covering behavior serves UV protection. We found no dependence of particle size on either species or urchin size, but we observed that larger urchins carried more and heavier debris. We observed a transport mechanism of debris onto the echinoid body surface utilizing a combination of tube feet and spines. The transport speed of individual debris items varied between species.We compare our results to previous studies of urchin covering behavior, comment on the phylogeny of urchin covering behavior and discuss the interpretation of this behavior as animal tool use.",1402,121,381,18.0

Coffee contains numerous phenolic compounds (coffee polyphenols) such as chlorogenic acids. However, evidence demonstrating the contribution of chlorogenic acids in preventing cognitive dysfunction induced by Alzheimer’s disease is limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of chlorogenic acids on prevention of cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS2 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Five-week-old APP/PS2 mice were administered a diet supplemented with coffee polyphenols daily for 5 months. The memory and cognitive function of mice was determined using the novel object recognition test, the Morris water maze test, and the step-through passive avoidance test. We found that chronic treatment with coffee polyphenols prevented cognitive dysfunction and significantly reduced hippocampal Aβ deposition. We then determined the effect of 5-caffeoylquinic acid, one of the primary components of coffee polyphenols, on Aβ formation. 5-Caffeoylquinic acid did not inhibit Aβ fibrillation, but degraded Aβ fibrils in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that coffee polyphenols prevented cognitive deficits and alleviated Aβ plaque deposition via disaggregation of Aβ in APP/PS2 mouse.",898,211,434,30.0

The study had a completely randomized design. The animals were submitted to seven treatments: T1) Enrichment with blue LED lighting; T2) Enrichment with fragrance of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) essential oil; T3) Enrichment with fragrance of lavender (Lavandula) essential oil; T4) Enrichment with fragrance of lemon (Citrus × latifolia) essential oil; T5) Enrichment with classical music, “The Four Seasons” by Vivaldi; T6) Creeps heated without environmental enrichment (control group); T7) Enrichment with fragrance of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil. The piglets were submitted to creeps with environmental enrichment under automatic control every 15 min (on/off), from 8 am to 5:45 pm (21 consecutive days). The environmental conditions of the creeps – air temperature, relative humidity, luminous intensity, and decibels – were evaluated within the creeps with environmental enrichment to determine the influence on the piglets’ behavior and productive performance. The results show that piglets submitted to creeps with environmental enrichment with blue artificial light and thyme essential oil showed reduced frequency outside the creeps when compared with treatment T6 (control). This showed the reduction of the stay of piglets in areas susceptible to crushing, in proximities to the mother.

Bruno Debruille",341057;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/341057,"Stimuli of the environment, like objects, systematically activate the actions they are associated to. These activations occur extremely fast. Nevertheless, behavioural data reveal that, in most cases, these activations are then automatically inhibited, around 100 ms after the occurrence of the stimulus. We thus tested whether this early inhibition could be indexed by a central component of the N1 event-related brain potential (ERP). To achieve that goal, we looked at whether this ERP component is greater in tasks that could increase the inhibition and in trials where reaction times happen to be long. The illumination of a real space bar of a keyboard out of the dark was used as a stimulus. To maximize the modulation of the inhibition, the task participants had to performed was manipulated across blocks. A look-only task and a count task were used to increase inhibition and an immediate press task was used to decrease it. ERPs of the two block-conditions where presses had to be prevented and where the largest central N1s were predicted were compared to those elicited in the press task, differentiating the ERPs to the third of the trials where presses were the slowest from the ERPs to the third of the trials with the fastest presses. Despite larger negativities due to motor potentials and despite greater attention likely in immediate press-trials, central N1s were found to be minimal for the fastest presses, intermediate for the slowest ones and maximal for the two no-press conditions. These results thus provide a strong support for the idea that the central N1 indexes an early and short lasting automatic inhibition of the actions systematically activated by objects. They also confirm that the strength of this automatic inhibition spontaneously fluctuates across trials and tasks. On the other hand, just before N1s, parietal P1s were found greater for fastest presses. They might thus index the initial activation of these actions. Finally, consistent with the idea that N300s index late inhibition processes, that occur preferentially when the task requires them, these ERPs were quasi absent for fast presses trials and much larger in the three other conditions.Highlights Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by a real objectSmaller parietal P1s and greater central N1s for slowest than for fastest motor responsesEven greater central N1s for tasks without such responsesCentral N1s may index early inhibition of stimulus-activated actionsN300s could index late inhibition of stimulus-activated actions",815,130,331,32.0

Aim of the study was to confirm whether effect of serotonergic drug (5-HTP) and dopaminergic drug (L-DOPA) is due to their conversion into serotonin and dopamine respectively or other products. For this study, PCPA (p-chlorophenylalanine, a long lasting inhibitor of serotonin synthesis), DDC (Diethyldithiocarbamate, which inhibits biosynthesis of nor-adrenaline), α-MT (Methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor for the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA) and DOPS (Dihydroxyphenylserine, a specific precursor for noradrenaline) were used in different groups in addition to 5-HTP and L-DOPA given at specific time interval. Reproductive responses monitored at 10 weeks post treatment indicate that gonadal activity was significantly low in HTP:DOPA (8-hr quail), HTP+PCPA:DOPA and HTP:DOPA+DDC quail compare to control (S:S). However, gonadal activity of HTP:S(HTP control), S:DOPA(DOPA control) and HTP: α-MT+DOPS was not different from S:S control and remained in active condition. These findings indicate that it is not the dose of neurotransmitter precursor drugs (5-HTP and L-DOPA) and the neurotransmitters (serotonin and dopamine itself) that cause the effect, instead it is the function of interval between the drug administration which induces or entrains specific phase relation between serotonergic and dopaminergic oscillations. Further, gonadal suppression observed in HTP:DOPA, HTP+PCPA:DOPA and HTP:DOPA+DDC group three groups is not due to injection of 5-HTP or L-DOPA (alone) but due to conversion of administered 5-HTP into serotonin and conversion of L-DOPA (administered) into dopamine; not due to their further conversion into catecholamines other than dopamine i.e. noradrenaline or adrenaline.",789,209,338,27.0

Adiponectin is also abundant in saliva, where its functions are poorly understood. Here we report that murine taste receptor cells express adiponectin receptors, and may be a target for salivary adiponectin. Analysis of a transcriptome dataset obtained by RNA-seq analysis of purified circumvallate taste buds, revealed high expression levels for three adiponectin receptor types. Immunohistochemical studies showed that two of these receptors, AdipoR1 and T-cadherin, are localized to subsets of taste receptor cells. Immunofluorescence for T-cadherin was primarily co-localized with the Type 2 taste receptor cell marker phospholipase β2, suggesting that adiponectin signaling could impact sweet, bitter, or umami taste signaling. However, adiponectin null mice showed no differences in taste responsiveness compared to wildtype controls in brief-access taste testing. AAV-mediated overexpression of adiponectin in the salivary glands of adiponectin null mice did result in a small but significant increase in behavioral taste responsiveness to the fat emulsion Intralipid. Together, these results suggest that salivary adiponectin can effect taste receptor cell function, though its impact on taste responsiveness and peripheral taste coding remains unclear.",983,209,384,36.0

Some researchers fixate on the limited resolution of D. melanogaster’s optics, other’s on their seemingly identical appearance; yet there is evidence of individual recognition and surprising visual learning in flies. Here, we apply machine learning and show that individual D. melanogaster are visually distinct. We also use the striking similarity of Drosophila’s visual system to current convolutional neural networks to theoretically investigate D. melanogaster’s capacity for visual understanding. We find that, despite their limited optical resolution, D. melanogaster’s neuronal architecture has the capability to extract and encode a rich feature set that allows flies to re-identify individual conspecifics with surprising accuracy. These experiments provide a proof of principle that Drosophila inhabit in a much more complex visual world than previously appreciated.Author summary In this paper, we determine a proof of principle for inter-individual recognition in two parts; is there enough information contained in low resolution pictures for inter-fly discrimination, and if so does Drosophila’s visual system have enough capacity to use it. We show that the information contained in a 29×29 pixel image (number of ommatidia in a fly eye) is sufficient to achieve 94% accuracy in fly re-identification. Further, we show that the fly eye has the theoretical capacity to identify another fly with about 75% accuracy. Although it is unlikely that flies use the exact algorithm we tested, our results show that, in principle, flies may be using visual perception in ways that are not usually appreciated.",2346,116,680,14.0

The “+” shaped apparatus consists of arms of different depth representing differentially aversive context. The paradigm was validated i.) in larval and juvenile zebrafish, ii.) after administration of compounds affecting human anxiety and iii.) in differentially aversive experimental conditions. Furthermore, we compared the SPM with conventional “anxiety tests” of larvae such as the open tank and light/dark tank tests to identify their shared characteristics. We clarified that the preference towards deeper water is conserved trough the ontogenesis and can be abolished by anxiolytic or enhanced by anxiogenic agents, respectively. The behavioural read-out is insensitive to the aversiveness of the platform and unrelated to behaviours assessed by conventional tests utilizing larval fish. Taken together, we developed a sensitive high-throughput test measuring anxiety-related responses of larval zebrafish, which likely reflect bottom-dwelling behaviour of adults, potentially supporting larva-based integrative approaches.",1037,124,585,21.0

Tackling this pest is problematic but exploiting behavioral rhythms could increase the impact of control. To do this, a better understanding of behavioral patterns is needed. Within this study we aimed to investigate rhythms in reproductive behavior of wild D. suzukii under natural conditions in the field. Environmental parameters were also recorded to decipher how they influence these rhythms. Assays were then performed on laboratory cultures, housed under artificial conditions mimicking the temperature and light cycles, to see if these patterns were reproducible and rhythmic. We were able to promote field like oviposition patterns within the laboratory using realistic temperature and light cycles regardless of variations in other factors including substrate, humidity, and lighting type. Locomotion activity was also recorded under these mimicked conditions to identify how this behavior interacts with oviposition rhythms. Both our field and laboratory assays show that oviposition behavior is likely under the control of the circadian clock and primarily occurs during the day, but these patterns will be disrupted by unfavorable temperature conditions. This was also found within locomotion rhythms. With an increased understanding of how these behaviors are influenced by environmental conditions, we highlight the importance of using realistic temperature and light cycles when investigating behavioral patterns.

Assessment tools to guide decisions about selection and refinement of EE practices are largely missing and our companion paper offers a theoretically grounded qualitative approach to the categorization and assessment of sensory, motor, and cognitive (SMC) EE strategies. Here, we propose and illustrate a model for quantitative assessment of enrichment practices using a sample of research facility, zoo, and sanctuary NHP environmental enrichment plans (EEP). Our scoring technique provides a means for comparing the efficacy of different strategies across facilities and allows for the selection of priority areas for improvement. Overall, our assessment tool provides a framework that has several advantages. It is inherently flexible. It can be tailored to fit a range of species. It can readily be adapted to accommodate new evidence about a specific EE strategy, or new EE strategies, or both. Because a scientifically valid evidence-based framework drives priority, our method is readily adaptable to different types of facilities and is more likely to lead to longer-term benefits, both in terms of the enhancement of psychological wellbeing of captive NHP, and with respect to the judicious use of limited resources.NHPnonhuman primatesEEenvironmental enrichmentEEPenvironmental enrichment plansSMCsensory motor cognitiveSSIBsomatic self-injurious behaviorNSSIBnon-somatic self-injurious behaviorUSDAUnited States Department of AgricultureAWAAnimal Welfare ActAZAAssociation of Zoos and AquariumsGFASGlobal Federation of Animal SanctuariesNRC GuideGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals",1305,261,1234,34.0

During mate search, theory predicts that the optimal search pattern depends on the expected distance to potential partners. A key question is whether actual males and females update their mate search patterns to increase encounter probability when conditions change. Here we show that two termite species, Reticulitermes speratus and Coptoterines formosanus, adaptively alternate between sexually monomorphic and dimorphic movements during mate search. After leaving their nests in a synchronized manner, termites begin to search for a mate. The resulting pairs perform tandem runs toward potential nest sites. We found that both sexes moved faster and in straight lines before finding partners, which is known to improve encounter rates when targets have completely unpredictable positions. In stark contrast, when pairs were accidentally separated during tandem running, they showed distinct sexually dimorphic movements, where females paused for long periods while males paused only briefly and moved actively. Data-based simulations demonstrated that such sexually dimorphic movements are advantageous when a mate is located nearby but its exact location is unknown. These results emphasize the importance of biological details to evaluate the efficiency of random search in animals. By extending the concept of mutual search beyond the context of mating, the dimorphic movements between partners represent a remarkable convergence between termites and other animals including humans.Significance Statement How should females and males move to search for partners whose exact location is unknown? Theory predicts that the answer depends on what they know about where targets can be found, indicating that the question doesn’t make sense until the searching context is clarified. We demonstrated that termites adaptively switch their search modes depending on the potential distance to their partners. When the location of potential mates was completely unpredictable, both sexes moved in straight lines to explore widely. In contrast, when the stray partner was at least nearby, males moved while females paused. Simulations confirmed that these movements increase the rate of successful encounters.

Summary statementOctopus optic glands employ a multiplex progression of signaling molecules to regulate maternal behaviors.1.  Post-reproductive life in the female octopus is characterized by an extreme pattern of maternal care: the mother cares for her clutch of eggs without feeding until her death. These maternal behaviors are completely eradicated if the optic glands, the octopus analog of the vertebrate pituitary gland, are removed from brooding females. Despite the optic gland’s importance in regulating maternal behavior, the molecular features underlying optic gland function are unknown. Here, we identify major signaling systems of the Octopus bimaculoides optic gland. Through behavioral analyses and transcriptome sequencing, we report that the optic gland undergoes remarkable molecular changes that coincide with transitions between behavioral stages. These include the dramatic up- and down-regulation of catecholamine, steroid, insulin, and feeding peptide pathways. Transcriptome analyses in other tissues demonstrate that these molecular changes are not generalized markers of aging and senescence, but instead, specific features of the optic glands. Our results provide strong evidence for the functional conservation of signaling molecules across evolutionarily distant species. For example, elevated levels of insulin growth factor binding proteins are associated with cachexia-like tissue wasting in flies, humans, and, reported here, octopuses. Our study expands the classic optic gland-pituitary gland analogy and indicates that, rather than a single “self-destruct” hormone, the maternal optic glands employ multiple pathways as systemic hormonal signals of behavioral control.",1361,225,813,32.0

Green-yellow elicits ‘settling behaviour’ while ultraviolet (UV) radiation initiates ‘migratory behaviour’. Electroretinograms of the photoreceptors’ spectral efficiency showed peaks in the green and the UV range and whitefly vision was said to be dichromatic.In order to study the visual behaviour of T. vaporariorum, nineteen narrow-bandwidth LEDs covering the UV-A and visible range were used in combination with light scattering acrylic glass screens in a small-scale choice arena under greenhouse conditions. Multiple-choice and dual-choice assays were performed, resulting in LED-based behavioural action spectra of settling (green) and migratory behaviour (UV). A potential inhibitory blue-green chromatic mechanism was studied by combining yellow with different blueish LEDs. Intensity dependencies were illustrated by changing LED intensities.Regarding the ‘settling response’, highest attraction was achieved by a green LED with a centroid wavelength of 550 nm, while a blue LED with 469 nm proved to be most inhibitory. Behaviour was distinctly intensity dependent. ‘Migratory behaviour’ was elicited the most by the UV LED with the shortest available wavelength of 373 nm. The results clearly prove the presence of a green and a yet undescribed blue sensitive photoreceptor and a blue-green opponent mechanism. Furthermore, empirical colour choice models were built and receptor peaks were estimated around 510 - 520 nm (green), 480 - 490 nm (blue) and 340 - 370 nm (UV).

In two experiments, we demonstrate that participants are more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses. Importantly, these differences in confidence were observed despite objectively equal choice difficulty and similar observed performance between those two contexts. Using computational modelling, we show that this bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected-value of choice options that has previously been demonstrated to be necessary to explain equal performance in the gain and loss domain. The biasing effect of context-value on confidence, also recently observed in the context of incentivized perceptual decision-making, is therefore domain-general, with likely important functional consequences.",1980,119,753,39.0

Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and conformity for determining whether local traditions establish across a landscape or whether a single preference dominates the whole population. The model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits Parus major, but also allows for a range of predictions for the emergence of animal culture under various initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias to be made.

Srinivasan",332379;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/332379,"Turning during flight is a complex behaviour that requires coordination to ensure that the resulting centrifugal force is never large enough to disrupt the intended turning trajectory. The centrifugal force during a turn increases with the curvature (sharpness) of the turn, as well as the speed of flight. Consequently, sharp turns would require lower flight speeds, in order to limit the centrifugal force to a manageable level and prevent unwanted sideslips. We have video-filmed honeybees flying near a hive entrance when the entrance is temporarily blocked. A 3D reconstruction and analysis of the flight trajectories executed during this loitering behaviour reveals that sharper turns are indeed executed at lower speeds. During a turn, the flight speed is matched to the curvature, moment to moment, in such a way as to maintain the centrifugal force at an approximately constant, low level of about 30% of the body weight, irrespective of the speed or the curvature of the turn. This ensures that turns are well coordinated, with few or no sideslips - as is evident from analysis of other properties of the flight trajectories.",1052,204,301,22.0

Moreover, because MHC products can influence the components of bodily secretions, an individual’s body odor may signal its MHC and influence partner identification or mate choice. To investigate MHC-based signaling and recipient sensitivity, we test for odor-gene covariance and behavioral discrimination of MHC diversity and pairwise dissimilarity, under the good genes and good fit paradigms, in a strepsirrhine primate, the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). First, we coupled genotyping with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate if diversity of the MHC-DRB gene is signaled by the chemical diversity of lemur genital scent gland secretions. We also assessed if the chemical similarity between individuals correlated with their MHC similarity. Next, we assessed if lemurs discriminated this chemically encoded, genetic information in opposite-sex conspecifics. We found that both sexes signaled overall MHC diversity and pairwise MHC similarity via genital secretions, but in a sex- and season-dependent manner. Additionally, both sexes discriminated absolute and relative MHC-DRB diversity in the genital odors of opposite-sex conspecifics, supporting previous findings that lemur genital odors function as advertisement of genetic quality. In this species, genital odors provide honest information about an individual’s absolute and relative MHC quality. Complementing evidence in humans and Old World monkeys, our results suggest that reliance on scent signals to communicate MHC quality may be important across the primate lineage.",1335,454,592,44.0

Interaction between hard-wired responses and changing motivational states determines whether a visual stimulus is attractive, aversive, or neutral. It is however difficult to separate the relative contribution of nature versus nurture in experimental paradigms, especially for more complex visual parameters such as the shape of objects. We used a closed-loop virtual reality paradigm for walking Drosophila flies to uncover innate visual preferences for the shape and size of objects, in a recursive choice scenario allowing the flies to reveal their visual preferences over time. We found that Drosophila flies display a robust attraction / repulsion profile for a range of objects sizes in this paradigm, and that this visual preference profile remains evident under a variety of conditions and persists into old age. We also demonstrate a level of flexibility in this behavior: innate repulsion to certain objects could be transiently overridden if these were novel, although this effect was only evident in younger flies. Finally, we show that a reward circuit in the fly brain, Drosophila neuropeptide F (dNPF), can be recruited to guide visual decision-making. Optogenetic activation of dNPF-expressing neurons converted a visually repulsive object into a more attractive object. This suggests that dNPF activity in the Drosophila brain guides ongoing visual choices, to override innate preferences and thereby provide a necessary level of behavioral flexibility in visual decision-making.",1169,296,549,48.0

However, a major drawback to these techniques has been their reliance on dimensionality reduction of images which destroys information about which parts of the body are used in each behavior. To address this issue, we introduce a deep learning-based method for pose estimation, LEAP (LEAP Estimates Animal Pose). LEAP automatically predicts the positions of animal body parts using a deep convolutional neural network with as little as 10 frames of labeled data for training. This framework consists of a graphical interface for interactive labeling of body parts and software for training the network and fast prediction on new data (1 hr to train, 185 Hz predictions). We validate LEAP using videos of freely behaving fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and track 32 distinct points on the body to fully describe the pose of the head, body, wings, and legs with an error rate of &lt;3% of the animal’s body length. We recapitulate a number of reported findings on insect gait dynamics and show LEAP’s applicability as the first step in unsupervised behavioral classification.

Moreover, recent years have seen a number of promising pre-clinical interventions fail to translate into clinical efficacy in humans. Improved treatments are unlikely without better animal-human translational pipelines. Here, we directly adapt–i.e. back-translate - a rodent measure of negative affective bias into humans, and explore its relationship with a)pathological mood and anxiety symptoms (study one) and b)transient induced anxiety (study two).Method Participants who met criteria for mood or anxiety disorder symptomatology according to a face-to-face neuropsychiatric interview were included in the symptomatic group. N = 77(47 asymptomatic; Female = 21; 30 symptomatic; Female = 25) participants completed study one and N = 47 asymptomatic participants (25 female) completed study two. Outcome measures were choice ratios, reaction times and parameters recovered from a computational model of reaction time; the drift diffusion model (DDM).Results Symptomatic individuals demonstrated increased negative affective bias relative to asymptomatic individuals (proportion high reward = 0.42(SD = 0.14), and 0.53(SD = 0.17), respectively) as well as reduced DDM drift rate (p = 0.004). No significant effects were observed for the within-subjects anxiety-induction in study 2.Conclusion Humans with pathological anxiety symptoms directly mimic rodents undergoing anxiogenic manipulation.

Norman, Jonathan D. Cohen",170720;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/170720,"A fundamental question in memory research is how different forms of memory interact. Previous research has shown that people rely on working memory (WM) in short-term recognition tasks; a common view is that episodic memory (EM) only influences performance on these tasks when WM maintenance is disrupted. However, retrieval of memories from EM has been widely observed during brief periods of quiescence, raising the possibility that EM retrievals during maintenance-critically, before a response can be prepared-might affect short-term recognition memory performance even in the absence of distraction. We hypothesized that this influence would be mediated by the lingering presence of reactivated EM content in WM. We obtained support for this hypothesis in three experiments, showing that delay-period EM reactivation introduces incidentally-associated information (context) into WM, and that these retrieved associations negatively impact subsequent recognition, leading to substitution errors (Experiment 1) and slowing of accurate responses (Experiment 2). fMRI pattern analysis showed that slowing is mediated by the content of EM reinstatement (Experiment 3).

Cramp, Matthew A. Gordos, Craig E. Franklin",332338;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/332338,"Significance Habitat fragmentation is a significant contributor to the worldwide decline of freshwater ecosystem health, the most pervasive cause of which is culverts. Culverts act as a barrier to fish movement, impacting feeding, predator avoidance, spawning, and community structures. Here we show that a common remediation strategy that involves baffles, is detrimental to the successful passage of small bodied and juvenile fish at high velocities. To remedy this widespread problem, we present a novel remediation design that benefits a range of small-bodied species and juvenile fish at the same high velocities, regardless of morphology or ecological niche. The application of this remediation design may be expanded to any smooth surfaced anthropogenic structure, to improve fish passage and restore ecosystem functionality. Culverts are a major cause of habitat fragmentation in freshwater ecosystems, are a barrier to fish movement, and are regarded as a significant contributor in the decline of freshwater fish populations globally. To try to address this, various culvert remediation designs have been implemented, including the installation of vertical baffles and the provision of naturalistic (rock) substrates. While remediation strategies generally aim to reduce the velocity of water flowing through the structure, there is often resistance to their use because the resultant reduction in culvert discharge can negatively impact upstream flooding while also resulting in debris clogging and increased culvert maintenance costs. In addition, baffles markedly increase water turbulence that may be detrimental to passage by some fish species or size classes. Here we present some novel remediation designs that exploit the reduced water velocity in boundary layers along the culvert wall to enhance fish passage without significantly compromising discharge capacity. These longitudinal designs produce an expanded reduced velocity zone along the culvert margins that generate minimal turbulence. We show that these novel designs are significantly advantageous to the swimming endurance and traversability for six small-bodied Australian fish species. We also provide data on how and why some culvert baffle designs may impede small-bodied fish passage. This data scales with increasing water velocity, encompassing inter-specific differences in swimming capacity. These results have broad implications for fish community structure and the requirement of juvenile cohort of large-bodied commercially important species where baffles have been implemented to facilitate fish passage.",1111,224,451,19.0

As the animal learns the environmental configuration, rats change from deliberative to habitual behavior, and VTE tends to disappear, suggesting a functional relevance in the early stages of learning. Despite the extensive research on spatial navigation, learning and VTE in the rat model, fewer studies have focused on humans. Here, we tested whether head-scanning behaviors that humans typically exhibit during spatial navigation are as predictive of spatial learning as in the rat. Subjects performed a goal-oriented virtual navigation task in a symmetric environment. Spatial learning was assessed through the analysis of trajectories, timings, and head orientations, under habitual and deliberative spatial navigation conditions. As expected, we found that trajectory length and duration decreased with the trial number, implying that subjects learned the spatial configuration of the environment over trials. Interestingly, IdPhi (a standard metric of VTE) also decreased with the trial number, suggesting that humans benefit from the same head-orientation scanning behavior as rats at spatial decision-points. Moreover, IdPhi captured exclusively at the first decision-point of each trial, was correlated with trial trajectory duration and length. Our findings demonstrate that in VTE is a signature of the stage of spatial learning in humans, and can be used to predict performance in navigation tasks with high accuracy.",1317,123,281,13.0

DiAngelo, Nicholas Santangelo",331660;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/331660,"Nutrient storage and metabolism effects on reproductive behavior are well studied in higher vertebrates like mammals, but are less understood in simpler systems. Drosophila melanogaster is well suited to study the ramifications of diet and metabolic energy storage on reproductive behaviors as they are commonly used to explore energy mobilization pathways. We tested, for the first time, courtship of the naturally occurring adipose (adp60) mutant which over-accumulates triglycerides and glycogen on a normal diet. We also fed wild type (WT) flies either a normal diet, high fat diet or food deprived them before measuring courtship, copulations, and glycogen and triglyceride levels. Adipose mutants decreased both courtship and copulation frequency, yet showed the highest glycogen and triglyceride levels. We suggest the adp60 physique and/or an altered ability to utilize mobilize energy explains these effects. Food deprived WT flies had the lowest glycogen and triglycerides but exhibited shortened courtship latencies with increased courtship behaviors. This may be due to a decreased lifespan of food deprived flies leading to a greater reproductive drive. However, high fat fed flies copulated more frequently and had the highest triglycerides among WT groups, yet equal glycogen levels to the normal fed WT group. Thus, a high fat diet either increases male attractivity or male courtship persistence. Taken together, available diet and nutrient storage affects male fly reproductive behavior in a unique manner, which may be explained by their natural history, and provides a paradigm for understanding energetics based on reproductive potential.",1037,185,433,26.0

One factor that can increase release success is size: released males may benefit competitively from being larger than their field counterparts. However, there could be a risk in releasing only large males if small field females avoid these males and instead prefer small males. Here we investigate this risk by evaluating mating success for mosquitoes differing in size. We measured mating success indirectly by coupling size with Wolbachia-infected or uninfected mosquitoes and scoring cytoplasmic incompatibility as a way of estimating relative mating success. Large females showed no evidence of a mating preference, whereas small males were relatively more successful than large males when mating with small females, exhibiting an advantage of around 20-25%. Because field females typically encompass a wide range of sizes while laboratory reared (and released) males typically fall into a narrow size range of large mosquitoes, these patterns can influence the success of release programs which rely on cytoplasmic incompatibility to suppress populations and initiate replacement invasions. Releases could include some small males generated under low food or crowded conditions to counter this issue, although this would need to be weighed against issues associated with costs of producing males of various size classes.",965,136,406,17.0

But explaining its evolution remains a challenge. While positive assortment – of cooperators with cooperators – is recognized as a basic requirement for the evolution of cooperation, the mechanisms governing assortment are debated. Moreover, the social structure of modern hunter-gatherers, characterized by high mobility, residential mixing and low genetic relatedness, undermine assortment and add to the puzzle of how cooperation evolved. Here, we analyze four years of data (2010, 2013, 2014, 2016) tracking residence and levels of cooperation elicited from a public goods game (PG), in Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. Data were collected from 56 camps, comprising 383 unique individuals, 137 of whom we have data for two or more years. Despite significant residential mixing, we observe a robust pattern of assortment necessary for cooperation to evolve: In every year, Hadza camps exhibit high between-camp and low within-camp variation in cooperation. We further consider the role of homophily in generating this assortment. We find little evidence that cooperative behavior within individuals is stable over time or that similarity in cooperation between dyads predicts their future cohabitation. Both sets of findings are inconsistent with homophilic models that assume stable cooperative and selfish types. Consistent with social norms, culture and reciprocity theories, the data suggest that the strongest predictor of an individual’s level of cooperation in any given year is the mean cooperation of their campmates in that year. These findings underscore the adaptive nature of human cooperation – particularly its responsiveness to social contexts – as a feature important in generating the assortment necessary for cooperation to evolve.",1521,413,627,37.0

Among the different environmental signals, olfactory cues are critically important for foraging, navigation, and social communication in many species, including ants. Ants use their two antennae to explore the olfactory world, but how they do so remains largely unknown. In this study, we use high resolution videography to characterize the antennae dynamics of carpenter ants (Camponotus pennsylvanicus). Antennae are highly active during both tracking and exploratory behavior. When tracking, ants used several distinct behavioral strategies with stereotyped antennae sampling patterns (which we call sinusoidal behavior, probing, and trail following). In all behaviors, left and right antennae movements were anti-correlated, and tracking ants exhibited biases in the use of left vs right antenna to sample the odor trail. These results suggest non-redundant roles for the two antennae. In one of the behavioral modules (trail following), ants used both antennae to detect trail edges and direct subsequent turns, suggesting a specialized form of tropotaxis. Lastly, removal of an antenna resulted not only in less accurate tracking but also in changes in the sampling pattern of the remaining antenna. Our quantitative characterization of odor trail tracking lays a foundation to build better models of olfactory sensory processing and sensorimotor behavior in terrestrial insects.Summary Statement High resolution imaging of antennae reveals distinct patterns of sampling with non-redundant roles in odor tracking.",1513,246,846,37.0

A central paradigm to study human memory search is the semantic fluency task, where participants are asked to retrieve as many items as possible from a category (e.g. animals). Observed responses tend to be clustered semantically. To understand when our mind decides to switch from one cluster/patch to the next, recent work has proposed two competing mechanisms. Under the first switching mechanism, people make strategic decision to switch away from a depleted patch based on marginal value theorem, similar to optimal foraging in a spatial environment. The second switching mechanism demonstrates that similar behavior patterns can emerge using a random walk on a semantic network, without necessarily involving strategic switches. In the current work, instead of comparing competing switching mechanisms over observed human data, we propose a rational account of the problem by examining what would be the optimal patch-switching policy under the framework of reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning agent, a Deep Q-Network (DQN), is built upon the random walk model and allows strategic switches based on features of the local semantic patch. After learning from rewards, the resulted policy of the agent gives rise to a third switching mechanism, which outperforms the previous two switching mechanisms. Our results provide theoretical justification of strategies used in human memory research, and shed light on how an optimal AI agent under realistic human constraints can generate hypothesis about human strategies in the same task.",1008,187,421,9.0

Šálek, Martin Bulla",324426;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/324426,"Incubation by both parents is the most common form of care for eggs. Although the involvement of the two parents may vary dramatically between and within pairs, as well as over the day and breeding season, detailed description of this variation (especially in species with variable male contribution to incubation) is rare. Here, we continuously video-monitored 113 nests of Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus over the breeding season to reveal the diversity of incubation rhythms and parental involvement. We found great between-nest variation in the overall nest attendance (68 –94%; median = 87%) and in how much males incubated (0 – 37%; median = 13%). Notably, the less the males incubated, the lower was the overall nest attendance, even though females partially compensated for the males’ decrease. Overall, incubation rhythms changed little over the season and incubation period. However, as nights shorten with the progressing breeding season, the female longest night incubation bout shortened too. Essentially, nest attendance was highest, incubation bouts longest, exchange gaps shortest and male involvement lowest during the night. Also, males tended to incubate the most after sunrise and before sunset. To conclude, we revealed strong circadian rhythms and remarkable between nest differences in Northern Lapwing incubation (especially in male involvement), yet despite seasonal environmental trends (e.g. increasing temperature) Lapwing incubation rhythms remained relatively stable over the season and incubation period.",810,99,249,12.0

To successfully accomplish ONS, transition between development stages is often coupled with changes in one or more primitive, instinctive behaviors. Yet, the underlining molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We show here that Leptinotarsa decemlineata larvae finish their ONS at the wandering stage by leaving the plant and pupating in soil. At middle wandering phase, larvae also switch their phototactic behavior, from photophilic at foraging period to photophobic. We find that enhancement of juvenile hormone (JH) signal delays the phototactic switch, and vise verse. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown of LdPTTH (prothoracicotropic hormone gene) or LdTorso (PTTH receptor gene) impairs avoidance response to light, a phenotype nonrescuable by 20-hydroxyecdysone. Consequently, the RNAi beetles pupate at the soil surface or in shallow layer of soil, with most of them failing to construct pupation chambers. Furthermore, a combination of depletion of LdPTTH/LdTorso and disturbance of JH signal causes no additional effects on light avoidance response and pupation site. Finally, we establish that TrpA1 (transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel) is necessary for light avoidance behavior, acting downstream of PTTH. We conclude that JH/PTTH cascade concomitantly regulates metamorphosis and the phototaxis switch, to drive ONS of the wandering beetles from plant into soil to start the immobile pupal stage.Author summary Many animals occupy distinct niches and utilize diverse resources at different development stages in order to meet stage-dependent requirements and overcome stage-specific limitations. This fitness is referred to as ontogenetic niche shift (ONS). During the preparation for ONS, animals often change one or more primitive, instinctive behaviors. Holometabolous insects, with four discrete developmental periods usually in different niches, are a suitable animal group to explore the molecular modes of these behavioral switches. Here we find that Leptinotarsa decemlineata larvae, an insect defoliator of potatoes, switch their phototactic behavior, from photophilic at feeding period to photophobic during the larval-pupal transition (wandering stage). This phototactic switch facilitates the wandering larvae to accomplish the ONS from potato plant to their pupation site below ground. We show that JH/PTTH cascade controls the phototaxis switch, through a step in photo transduction between the photoreceptor molecule and the transient receptor potential cation channel.",1062,149,289,40.0

The study used 243 Saanen doe kids (4±1.0 days old; mean ± SD) on two commercial dairy goat farms, and were disbudded with either (i) clove oil injection (CLOVE), (ii) a cautery iron and bud removed (BUDOFF), or (iii) a cautery iron with bud left intact (BUDON). Each kid received a different treatment per bud, which were balanced between buds (left and right) and randomly allocated. A trained observer monitored bud growth following treatment for 3 months recording either: N: no growth, H: normal horn, S: abnormal horn (scur), or SC: soft, fibrous lump (scorn). After the final observation, buds were assessed for the probability of detecting (i) success (no growth), (ii) scurs, (iii) horns or (iv) scorns [with 95% CI]. The probability of success for BUDOFF (0.77 [0.63, 0.87]) was higher than for BUDON (0.20 [0.11, 0.34]) and CLOVE (0.09 [0.04, 0.18]; P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, the probability of success for BUDON was higher than for CLOVE (P ≤ 0.05). The probability of scurs was higher for CLOVE (0.72 [0.63, 0.80]) than BUDOFF (0.25 [0.17, 0.34]) and BUDON (0.30 [0.21, 0.39]; P ≤ 0.05). There was no difference in the probability of scurs for BUDOFF and BUDON (P &gt; 0.05). The probability of horns was higher for CLOVE (0.21 [0.15, 0.29]) than BUDON (0.02 [0.01, 0.06]; P ≤ 0.05); horns were not observed for BUDOFF. The probability of scorns for BUDON, the only treatment that led to scorns, was 0.41 (0.25, 0.60). These results suggest that BUDOFF was more effective at preventing growth than CLOVE and BUDON and appears the most effective method, of the methods tested, for disbudding kids.

Consequently, we investigated whether men’s (N=59) scores on the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale were related to either within-subject changes or between-subject differences in men’s testosterone levels. Men’s responses on the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale did not appear to track within-subject changes in testosterone. By contrast with one recent study, men’s Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale also did not appear to be related to individual differences in testosterone.

Gordon, Naomi Ehrich Leonard",322974;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/322974,"Ant colonies regulate activity in response to changing conditions without using centralized control. Harvester ant colonies forage in the desert for seeds, and their regulation of foraging manages a tradeoff between spending and obtaining water. Foragers lose water while outside in the dry air, but the colony obtains water by metabolizing the fats in the seeds they eat. Previous work shows that the rate at which an outgoing forager leaves the nest depends on its recent experience of brief antennal contact with returning foragers that carry a seed. We examine how this process can yield foraging rates that are robust to uncertainty and responsive to temperature and humidity across minutes to hour-long timescales. To explore possible mechanisms, we develop a low-dimensional analytical model with a small number of parameters that captures observed foraging behavior. The model uses excitability dynamics to represent response to interactions inside the nest and a random delay distribution to represent foraging time outside the nest. We show how feedback of outgoing foragers returning to the nest stabilizes the incoming and outgoing foraging rates to a common value determined by the “volatility” of available foragers. The model exhibits a critical volatility above which there is sustained foraging at a constant rate and below which there is cessation of foraging. To explain how the foraging rates of colonies adjust to temperature and humidity, we propose a mechanism that relies on foragers modifying their volatility after they leave the nest and get exposed to the environment. Our study highlights the importance of feedback in the regulation of foraging activity and points to modulation of volatility as a key to explaining differences in foraging activity in response to conditions and across colonies. Our results present opportunities for generalization to other contexts and systems with excitability and feedback across multiple timescales.Author Summary We investigate the collective behavior that allows colonies of desert harvester ants to regulate foraging activity in response to environmental conditions. We develop an analytical model connecting three processes: 1) the interactions between foragers returning to the nest and available foragers waiting inside the nest, 2) the effect of these interactions on the likelihood of available foragers to leave the nest to forage, and 3) the return of foragers to the nest after finding seeds. We propose a mechanism in which available foragers modify their response to interactions after their first exposure to the environment. We show how this leads to colony foraging rates that adjust to environmental conditions over time scales from minutes to hours. Our model may prove useful for studying resilience in other classes of systems with excitatory dynamics.",907,183,375,38.0

Using a within-subject design, participants searched for both spatially and conceptually correlated rewards in multi-armed bandit tasks. We use a Gaussian Process model combining generalization with an optimistic sampling strategy to capture human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and to simulate human-level performance when specified with participant parameter estimates.

What drives this behavior and under which conditions can it be beneficial for an individual? Using simulations in both static and dynamic environments, we show that sharing information can lead to individual benefits through the mechanisms of pseudo-reciprocity, whereby shared information leads to by-product benefits for an individual without the need for explicit reciprocation. Crucially, imitation with a certain level of innovation is required to avoid a tragedy of the commons, while the mechanism of a local visibility radius allows for the coordination of self-organizing collectives of agents. When these two mechanisms are present, we find robust evidence for the benefits of sharing—even when others do not reciprocate.",1545,157,384,6.0

Within risky versions of the spatially correlated multi-armed bandit task, we show that participants’ behavior is aligned well with a Gaussian process function learning algorithm, which chooses points based on a safe optimization routine. Moreover, using leave-one-block-out cross-validation, we find that participants adapt their sampling behavior to the riskiness of the task, although the underlying function learning mechanism remains relatively unchanged.

In the Full DDM implementation, parameters are allowed to vary from trial-to-trial, making the model more powerful but also more challenging to fit to behavioural data. Current approaches yield typically poor fitting quality, are computationally expensive and usually require assuming constant threshold parameter across trials. Moreover, in most versions of the DDM, the sequence of participants’ choices is considered independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), a condition often violated in real data.Our contribution to the field is threefold: first, we introduce Variational Bayes as a method to fit the full DDM. Second, we relax the i.i.d. assumption, and propose a data-driven algorithm based on a Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE-DDM), that estimates the local posterior probability of the DDM parameters at each trial based on the sequence of parameters and data preceding the current data point. Finally, we extend this algorithm to illustrate that the RAE-DDM provides an accurate modelling framework for regression analysis. An important result of the approach we propose is that inference at the trial level can be achieved efficiently for each and every parameter of the DDM, threshold included. This data-driven approach is highly generic and self-contained, in the sense that no external input (e.g. regressors or physiological measure) is necessary to fit the data. Using simulations, we show that this method outperforms i.i.d.-based approaches (either Markov Chain Monte Carlo or i.i.d.-VB) without making any assumption about the nature of the between-trial correlation of the parameters.",3524,1370,1562,64.0

Interventions that halt the spreading glutamatergic over-activity in this region and thereby the development of overt schizophrenia could be promising therapies. However, animal models with high construct validity to support such pre-clinical development are scarce. The Cyclin-D2 knockout (CD2-KO) mouse model shows a hippocampal Parvalbumin-interneuron dysfunction and its pattern of hippocampal over-activity shares similarities with that seen in prodromal patients. In a comprehensive phenotyping of CD2-KO mice, we found that they displayed novelty-induced hyperlocomotion (a correlate in the positive symptom domain), that was largely resistant against D1- and D2-dopamine receptor antagonism, but responsive to the mGluR2/3-agonist LY379268. In the negative symptom domain, CD2-KO mice showed transiently reduced sucrose-preference (anhedonia), but enhanced interaction with novel mice and objects, as well as normal nest building and incentive motivation. Also, unconditioned anxiety, perseveration, and motor impulsivity were unaltered. However, in the cognitive domain, CD2-knockouts showed reduced executive function in assays of rule-shift and rule-reversal learning, but also an impairment in working memory, that was resistant against LY379268.

To control for behavioral differences among differentially-sized leaders, we used biomimetic robotic fish – Robofish – of different sizes. Robofish is accepted as a conspecific by live guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and provides standardized behaviors irrespective of its size. We specifically asked whether larger leaders are preferentially followed when behavior is controlled for and whether the preferences of followers depend on their own body size or their risk taking behavior (‘boldness’). We found that live guppies followed larger Robofish leaders closer than smaller ones and this pattern was independent of the followers’ own body size as well as risk-taking behavior.

While navigating within such environments animals need to perceive and disambiguate environmental features that might obstruct their flight. The most elemental aspect of aerial navigation through such environments is gap identification and passability evaluation. We used bumblebees to seek insights into the mechanisms used for gap identification when confronted with an obstacle in their flight path and behavioral compensations employed to assess gap properties. Initially, bumblebee foragers were trained to fly though an unobstructed flight tunnel that led to a foraging chamber. After the bees were familiar with this situation, we placed a wall containing a gap that unexpectedly obstructed the flight path on a return trip to the hive. The flight trajectories of the bees as they approached the obstacle wall and traversed the gap were analyzed in order to evaluate their behavior as a function of the distance between the gap and a background wall that was placed behind the gap. Bumblebees initially decelerate when confronted with an unexpected obstacle. Deceleration was first noticed when the obstacle subtended around 35° on the retina but also depended on the properties of the gap. Subsequently the bees gradually traded off their longitudinal velocity to lateral velocity and approached the gap increasing lateral displacements and lateral velocity. Bumblebees shaped their flight trajectory depending on the salience of the gap, in our case, indicated by the optic flow contrast between the region within the gap and on the obstacle, which increases with decreasing distance between the gap and the background wall. As the optic flow contrast decreased the bees spent increasing time moving laterally across the obstacles. During these repeated lateral maneuvers the bees are likely assessing gap geometry and passability.",903,83,315,24.0

Here, we examine the hypothesis that in the Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis, Diptera: Tephritidae), the presence or absence of gut symbionts affects foraging behavior and nutrient ingestion. We offered protein starved flies, symbiotic or aposymbiotic, a choice between diets containing all amino acids or only the non-essential ones. The different diets were presented in a foraging arena as drops that varied in their size and density, creating an imbalanced foraging environment. Suppressing the microbiome resulted in significant changes of the foraging behavior of both male and female flies. Aposymbiotic flies responded faster to the diets offered in experimental arenas, spent more time feeding, ingested more drops of food, and were constrained to feed on time consuming patches (containing small drops of food), when these offered the full complement of amino acids. We discuss these results in the context of previous studies on the effect of the gut microbiome on host behavior, and suggest that these be extended to the life history dimension.Importance and significance of the study The gut bacteria of tephritid fruit flies provide nutritional benefits to their hosts, by making essential amino-acids readily available. Foraging for food is risky, as active flies are exposed to predators and incur a considerable investment of time and energy. Therefore, making beneficial compromises between the feeding time and nutrient ingestion is a question of survival for the flies. Our study demonstrates how gut bacteria drive this behavior by allowing symbiotic flies to forage optimally while acquiring essential nutrients. This finding adds a novel step to the nexus connecting the insect gut, its microbiome, the nervous system, chemoreception to individual patterns of foraging.",882,208,456,38.0

Therefore, the evolution of egalitarian behaviour has been the subject of long-standing debate in a wide variety of disciplines. A recent hypothesis states that a social control against potentially dominant individuals played an important role in the emergence of an egalitarian society, although this has not been modelled directly. In the present study, we modelled this hypothesis based on the n-player game framework, in which the owner, who may attempt to monopolise resources, could be punished by a coalition of other group members. Our results suggest that a potentially despotic payoff structure can promote the evolution of egalitarian behaviour. Besides, large group size, small cost of competition, and variation in the strengths of individuals can promote the evolution of egalitarian behaviour. Our results suggest the importance of both social control against dominant individuals and benefits of a coalition for the evolution of egalitarian behaviour.",840,244,294,23.0

Here we investigate the relationship between phoneme categorization and reading ability, with special attention to the nature of the cue encoding the phoneme contrast (static versus dynamic), differences in task paradigm difficulty, and methodological details of psychometric model fitting. We find a robust relationship between reading ability and categorization performance, show that task difficulty cannot fully explain that relationship, and provide evidence that the deficit is not restricted to dynamic cue contrasts, contrary to prior reports. Finally, we demonstrate that improved modeling of behavioral responses suggests that the gap between dyslexics and typical readers may be smaller than previously reported.",1196,123,551,26.0

A primary drawback in exposure-based therapies is the high rate of relapse when higher order inhibitory structures failed to inhibit the emotional responses driven by the defensive circuit. It has been shown that implicit exposure of fearful stimuli leads to a long-lasting reduction of avoidance behavior in patients with phobia through the facilitation of fear processing areas in the absence of subjective fear. Despite the potential benefits of this approach in the treatment of phobias and PTSD, implicit exposure to fearful stimuli is still under-investigated. Here, we used unconscious presentation of threat-conditioned stimuli in healthy humans, using a continuous flash suppression technique. We found that implicit exposure of a conditioned stimulus reduced, on the following day, defensive responses to the conditioned stimulus measured by threat-potentiated startle responses but not by the electrodermal activity.

Mutual influences among interacting individuals may modulate the social responsiveness seen and thus makes it often difficult to study the level and variation of individuality in responsiveness. Here, biomimetic robots (BRs) that are accepted as conspecifics but controlled by the experimenter can be a useful tool. Studying the interactions of live animals with BRs allows pinpointing the live animal’s level of responsiveness by removing confounding mutuality. In this paper, we show that live guppies (Poecilia reticulata) exhibit consistent differences among each other in their responsiveness when interacting with a biomimetic fish robot - ‘Robofish’ - and a live companion. It has been repeatedly suggested that social responsiveness correlates with other individual behavioral traits like risk-taking behavior (‘boldness’) or activity level.

Buechel, Alexander Kotrschal, Niclas Kolm",300335;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/300335,"Background Brain size is expected to evolve by a balance between cognitive benefits and energetic costs. Several influential hypotheses have suggested that large brains may be especially beneficial in social contexts. Group living and competition may pose unique cognitive challenges to individuals and favor the evolution of increased cognitive ability. Evidence comes from comparative studies on the link between social complexity and brain morphology, but the strength of empirical support has recently been challenged. In addition, the behavioral mechanisms that would link cognitive ability to sociality are rarely studied. Here we take an alternative approach and investigate experimentally how brain size can relate to the social competence of individuals within species, a problem that so far has remained unresolved. We use the unique guppy brain size selection line model system to evaluate whether large brains are advantageous by allowing individuals to better assess their performance in a social contest situation. Based on theoretical literature, we predict that contest duration should depend on the brain size of the loser, as it is the capitulation of the losing individual that ends the fight.Results First, we show that studying the movement of competitors during contests allows for precise estimation of the dominance timeline in guppies, even when overt aggression is typically one-sided and delayed. Second, we staged contests between pairs of male that had been artificially selected for large and small relative brain size, with demonstrated differences in cognitive ability. We show that dominance was established much earlier in contests with large-brained losers, whereas the brain size of the winner had no effect. Following our prediction, large-brained individuals gave up more quickly when they were going to lose.Conclusions These results suggest that large-brained individuals assess their performance in contests better and that social competence indeed can depend on brain size. Conflict resolution may therefore be an important behavioral mechanism behind macro-evolutionary patterns between sociality and brain size. Since conflict is ubiquitous among group-living animals, the possible effects of the social environment on the evolution of cognition may be more broadly applicable than previously thought.",2208,105,736,21.0

We examined whether pigeons and crows adjust their pecking to the visual distortion caused by prisms. We found that vision plays a role only before movement begins in pigeons, whereas crows may have more flexible visuomotor skills. Pecking in birds is analogous to reaching and grasping movements in primates. Although pecking in pigeons is highly stereotypic, crows show dexterous pecking skills. To unveil what sensorimotor mechanisms underlie the flexibility of pecking in crows, the current study examined whether pigeons and crows adjust their pecking to the visual distortion induced by prisms. Because prisms induce visual shifts of object positions, birds were required to adjust their movements. Pecking kinematics were examined before and after attaching prisms in front of the birds’ eyes. As a result, crows showed faster adjustment of pecking trajectories than pigeons. Correlational analysis showed that the initial deviation of trajectory strongly influenced the subsequent deviation in pigeons, but not in crows. These results suggest that pecking in pigeons is controlled in a feedforward manner, and vision plays a role before movement initiation, although pecking in crows is under the on-line motor control, serving a possible mechanism for flexible visuomotor skills.",985,241,288,15.0

In order to mimic a well-characterised stress situation, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to poor water quality (hypoxia combined with high ammonia level) for three weeks (stressed group, S) and compared to a non-stressed control group (NS). After a return to water quality standard, emotional responses were assessed in fish subjected to two potentially threatening situations: (i) social isolation in a novel environment and (ii) human presence. In addition, we used an appetitive-conditioning paradigm to determine whether previous chronic deterioration of water quality disturbs cognitive abilities in fish. Spontaneous behaviour in the tanks was also recorded during the environmental challenge as a reference for fish activity. We observed that in S fish, plasma cortisol levels were increased before and after social isolation in a novel environment compared to the plasma cortisol levels in the NS group, despite the absence of a behavioural difference between the two groups. Under deteriorated water quality, fish locomotor activity was globally reduced and this reduction was correlated to increased shoaling behaviour. Farmers can use these first behavioural modifications as a sentinel detector for fish welfare impairment. More importantly, we demonstrated that reactivity to a human presence in a home-environment and food-anticipatory behaviour were both inhibited in the S group. We consider that these two sentience-based tests are highly relevant for fish welfare assessment at the group level and are easy to use in the aquaculture industry.",1105,115,302,36.0

Convergent results suggest that this mechanism is associated with specific neural circuits located within the Central Complex (CC).

Our aim was to understand how wild-type flies react to the abrupt appearance of a visual distractor during an ongoing locomotor action. Thus, we adapted the well-known ‘Buridan paradigm’, used to study walking behaviour in flies, so we could specifically address the mechanisms involved in action selection. We found that flies tended to react in one of two ways when confronted with a visual distractor during ongoing locomotion. Flies either: (i) committed to a new path situated midway between the original target and the distractor, consistent with a novelty effect; or (ii) remained on the original trajectory with a slight deviation in direction of the distractor. We believe that these results provide the first indication of how flies react, from the motor point of view, in a bi-stable context requiring the presence of selection-for-action mechanisms. Some considerations on the neural circuits underlying such behavioural responses are advanced.",1158,133,526,32.0

The presence of this general class of behavior is extremely widespread, even though the olfactory sensory apparatus and strategies used may vary between animals. The strategies and cues used by mammals to localize and track odor sources have recently become of interest to neuroscientists, but are still poorly understand. In order to study how mice localize odors, we trained mice to perform a trail following task using a novel behavioral paradigm and behavioral monitoring setup. We find that mice, in order to follow an odor trail, use both sniff by sniff odor concentration comparisons and internares comparisons to guide their behavior. Furthermore, they employ olfactory information to guide adaptive behaviors with remarkably short latencies of approximately 80ms. This study and its findings establish a rich, quantifiable olfactory localization behavior in mice that is amenable to physiological investigations and motivates investigation into the neural substrates of the identified olfactory cues.Significance Many animals, like rodents, rely heavily on their sense smell to guide them as they navigate their environment, to find food and mates and to avoid predators. Yet, in mammals, this function of the olfactory system is much less well studied than odor identification. We created a behavioral task where mice had to follow odor trails in order to efficiently find food and then tracked their movements around those trails. We found that they respond to sniff-by-sniff changes in odor intensity, using those changes to guide movements in less than one tenth of a second and also confirm that they use stereo cues to guide behavior.

Here, in an attempt to fill this gap, we investigated reinforcement learning behavior and its computational substrates in a task where we orthogonally manipulated both outcome valence and magnitude, resulting in systematic variations in state-values. Over two experiments, model comparison indicated that subjects’ behavior is best accounted for by an algorithm which includes both reference point-dependence and range-adaptation – two crucial features of state-dependent valuation. In addition, we found state-dependent outcome valuation to progressively emerge over time, to be favored by increasing outcome information and to be correlated with explicit understanding of the task structure. Finally, our data clearly show that, while being locally adaptive (for instance in negative valence and small magnitude contexts), state-dependent valuation comes at the cost of seemingly irrational choices, when options are extrapolated out from their original contexts.",1112,120,327,25.0

Such studies have demonstrated that faces can be detected within natural scenes within as little as 100ms (Crouzet, Kirchner &amp; Thorpe, 2010), while increasingly complex decisions require longer processing times (Besson, Barragan-Jason, Thorpe, Fabre-Thorpe, Puma et al., 2017). Following the notion that facial representations stored in memory facilitate perceptual processing (Ramon &amp; Gobbini, 2018), a recent study reported 180ms as the fastest speed at which “familiar face detection” based on expressed choice saccades (Visconti di Ollegio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2015). At first glance, these findings seem incompatible with the earliest neural markers of familiarity reported in electrophysiological studies (Barragan-Jason, Cauchoix &amp; Barbeau, 2015; Caharel, Ramon &amp; Rossion, 2014; Huang, Wu, Hu, Wang, Ding &amp; Qu et al., 2017), which should temporally precede any overtly observed behavioral (oculomotor or manual) categorization. Here, we reason that this apparent discrepancy could be accounted for in terms of decisional space constraints, which modulate both manual RTs observed for different levels of visual processing (Besson et al., 2017), as well as saccadic RTs (SRTs) in both healthy observers and neurological patients (Ramon, in press; Ramon, Sokhn, Lao &amp; Caldara, in press). In the present study, over 70 observers completed three different SRT experiments in which decisional space was manipulated through task demands and stimulus probability. Subjects performed a gender categorization task, or one of two familiar face “recognition” tasks, which differed with respect to the number of personally familiar identities presented (3 vs. 7). We observe an inverse relationship between visual categorization proficiency and decisional space. Observers were most accurate for categorization of gender, which could be achieved in as little as 140ms. Categorization of highly predictable targets was more error-prone and required an additional ~100ms processing time. Our findings add to increasing evidence that pre-activation of identity-information can modulate early visual processing in a top-down manner.

Genetically tractable model organisms facilitate mechanistic explanations of learning that span genetic, neural circuit, and behavioural levels. Many aspects of neural physiology, including processes that underlie learning (e.g. neurotransmitter release and long-lasting changes in synaptic strength), are regulated by brief and local changes in [μm] levels of free intracellular Ca2+. On this scale, changes in [Ca2+] activate many Ca2+-sensors, including the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs). Here we reveal that the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of CaMK1/4, CMK-1, functions in primary sensory neurons to regulate responses to mechanical stimuli and behavioral plasticity, specifically habituation, a conserved form of non-associative learning. The habituation phenotypes of cmk-1 mutants were dependent on interstimulus interval (ISI), such that CMK-1 slows habituation at short ISIs, but promotes it at long ISIs.

A total of 325’895 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were retained. The software TASSEL 5 was used to run a genome-wide association study (GWAS), with a generalized liner model (GLM) and1000 permutations. The analysis yielded a set of 45 SNPs that were significantly associated with the reported affinity to cannabis, including one strong outlier found in the MYO16 gene. A diagnostic process is proposed by which individuals can be assessed for their affinity to cannabis. We believe this type of tool may be helpful in alleviating some of the stigma associated with cannabis use in individuals sensitive to THC and other cannabis constituents such as myrcene, which may potentiate negative responses.",3179,121,673,2.0

Milton, Anthony Dickinson",284216;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/284216,"The higher response rates observed on ratio than on matched interval reward schedules has been attributed to the differential reinforcement of longer inter-response times (IRTs) on the interval contingency. Some data, however, seem to contradict this hypothesis, showing that the difference is still observed when the role of IRT reinforcement is neutralized by using a regulated-probability interval schedule (RPI). Given the mixed evidence for these predictions, we re-examined this hypothesis by training three groups of rats to lever press under ratio, interval and RPI schedules across two phases while matching reward rates within triads. At the end of the first phase, the master ratio and RPI groups responded at similar rates. In the second phase, an interval group yoked to the same master ratio group of the first phase responded at a lower rate than the RPI group. Post-hoc analysis showed comparable reward rates for master and yoked schedules. The experienced response-outcome rate correlations were likewise similar, and approached zero as training progressed. We discuss these results in terms of dual-system theories of instrumental conditioning.",1292,163,537,25.0

We tested how groups of eastern subterranean termites (Reticulitermes flavipes) deploy these behaviours when presented with a nestmate at different stages of infection with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. As expected, the termites groomed pathogen-exposed individuals significantly more than mock-treated controls; however, grooming levels were significantly higher after spore germination than before. Cannibalism became prevalent only after exposed termites became visibly ill, and burial was rarely observed. These results demonstrate that termites employ different strategies depending on the stage of infection that they encounter. Grooming intensity is linked not only to pathogen presence, but also to germination status, and, given the temporal correlation between cannibalism and visible signs of illness, the host may play a role in triggering its own sacrifice.",2130,129,518,19.0

Gawryszewski",160341;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/160341,"The sensory drive theory predicts that signals, sensory systems, and signaling behavior should coevolve. Variation in the sensory systems of prey and predators may explain the diversity of color signals, such as color polymorphism. The spider Gasteracantha cancriformis (Araneidae) possesses several conspicuous color morphs. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the color polymorphism of G. cancriformis may be maintained by pressure from multiple signal receivers, such as prey and predators with distinct color vision systems. Although, the multiple receivers world is a more realistic scenario, it has received little attention. In orb-web spiders, the prey attraction hypothesis states that conspicuous colors are prey lures that increase spider foraging success via flower mimicry. However, in highly defended species, conspicuous colors could also be a warning signal to predators. We used color vision modelling to estimate chromatic and achromatic contrast of G. cancriformis morphs as perceived by potential prey and predator taxa. Our results revealed that individual prey and predator taxa perceive the conspicuousness of morphs differently. For instance, the red morph is perceived as quite conspicuous to lepidopteran prey and avian predators, but not by other insects. Therefore, the multiple prey and predator hypotheses may explain the evolution of color polymorphism in G. cancriformis. However, flower mimicry hypothesis was weakly corroborated. Other parameters that are not evaluated by color vision models, such as distance, shape, angle, and pattern geometry could also affect the perception of color morphs by both prey and predators and thereby influence morph survival.",1874,316,683,31.0

However, two sources of error can diminish collective wisdom: individual estimation biases and information sharing between individuals.

We first investigate how existing aggregation methods, such as calculating the arithmetic mean or the median, are influenced by these sources of error. We show that the mean tends to overestimate, and the median underestimate, the true value for a wide range of numerosities. Quantifying estimation bias, and mapping individual bias to collective bias, allows us to develop and validate three new aggregation measures that effectively counter sources of collective estimation error. In addition, we present results from a further experiment that quantifies the social influence rules that individuals employ when incorporating personal estimates with social information. We show that the corrected mean is remarkably robust to social influence, retaining high accuracy in the presence or absence of social influence, across numerosities, and across different methods for averaging social information. Utilizing knowledge of estimation biases and social influence rules may therefore be an inexpensive and general strategy to improve the wisdom of crowds.",1592,105,976,24.0

To test this, we extract participants’ priors over various contexts using a free-form forecasting paradigm. Instead of exhibiting systematic biases, our results show that participants’ priors match well with structure found in real-world data.

We found that GABAergic periglomerular interneuron populations in the olfactory bulb endogenously respond not only to odors but also to visual, auditory, and somatosensory stimuli in waking (but not anesthetized) mice. When these stimuli predict future odors, they evoke enhanced interneuron activity during the time odor normally occurs. When expectations are violated by omitting an expected “warning tone” before an odor, odor presentation evokes a burst of interneuron activity. The resulting GABA release presynaptically suppresses neurotransmitter release from the axon terminals of olfactory sensory neurons, the cells that transduce odor in the nasal epithelium and communicate this information to the brain. Expectations, even those evoked by cues in other sensory modalities, can thus affect the very first neurons in the olfactory system.",1124,138,490,16.0

Ludvig",067603;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/067603,"Habits form a crucial component of behavior. In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.",6831,868,5586,27.0

Mutations in CHIP are the driver of spinocerebellar autosomal recessive 16 (SCAR16), or cerebellar CHIPopathy, as we initially discovered this disease was caused by a loss of CHIP ubiquitin ligase function. The initial mutation describing SCAR16 was a missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase domain of CHIP (p.T246M). Using multiple biophysical and cellular approaches, we demonstrate that T246M mutation results in structural disorganization and misfolding of the CHIP U-box domain, promoting oligomerization, and increased proteasome-dependent turnover. CHIP-T246M has no ligase activity, but maintains interactions with chaperones and alters the co-chaperone function of CHIP. To establish preclinical models of SCAR16, we engineered T246M at the endogenous locus in both mice and rats. Animals homozygous for T246M had both cognitive and motor cerebellar dysfunction distinct from those observed in the CHIP null animal model, as well as deficits in learning and memory, reflective of the cognitive deficits reported in SCAR16 patients. We conclude that the T246M mutation is not equivalent to the total loss of CHIP, supporting the concept that disease-causing CHIP mutations have different biophysical and functional repercussions on CHIP function that may directly correlate to the spectrum of clinical phenotypes observed in SCAR16 patients. Our findings both further expand our basic understanding of CHIP biology and provide meaningful mechanistic insight underlying the molecular drivers of SCAR16 disease pathology, which may be used to inform the development of novel therapeutics for this devastating disease.",1335,139,552,58.0

Two areas in particular have been repeatedly implicated: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). However, it is still unclear what the function of each of these areas is and how they differ from each other. To establish the specific roles of DLPFC and aPFC in metacognition, we employed online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to causally interfere with their functioning during confidence generation. Human subjects from both sexes performed a perceptual decision-making task and provided confidence ratings. We found a clear dissociation between the two areas: DLPFC TMS lowered confidence ratings, whereas aPFC TMS increased metacognitive ability but only for the second half of the experimental blocks. These results support a functional architecture where DLPFC reads out the strength of the sensory evidence and relays it to aPFC, which makes the confidence judgement by potentially incorporating additional, non-perceptual information. Indeed, simulations from a model that incorporates these putative DLPFC and aPFC functions reproduced our behavioral results. These findings establish DLPFC and aPFC as distinct nodes in a metacognitive network and suggest specific contributions from each of these regions to confidence generation.SignificanceThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be critical for metacognition. Two of its sub-regions - dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and anterior PFC (aPFC) - have specifically been implicated in confidence generation. However, it is unclear if these regions have distinct functions related to the underlying metacognitive computation. Using a causal intervention with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we demonstrate that DLPFC and aPFC have dissociable contributions: targeting DLPFC decreased average confidence ratings, while targeting aPFC specifically affected metacognitive scores. Based on these results, we postulated specific functions for DLPFC and aPFC in metacognitive computation and corroborated them using a computational model that reproduced our results. Our causal results reveal the existence of a specialized modular organization in PFC for confidence generation.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Ji Won Bang for help with the experiment setup and Lindley Hudson for assistance with experiment preparation and subject recruitment.

In this crowded environment, workers combat disease by removing or burying their dead or diseased nestmates. For honey bees, we found that hygienic brood-removal behavior is triggered by two odorants – β-ocimene and oleic acid – which are released from brood upon freeze-killing. β-ocimene is a co-opted pheromone that normally signals larval food-begging, whereas oleic acid is a conserved necromone across arthropod taxa. Interestingly, the odorant blend can induce hygienic behavior more consistently than either odorant alone. We suggest that the volatile β-ocimene flags hygienic workers’ attention, while oleic acid is the death cue, triggering removal. Bees with high hygienicity detect and remove brood with these odorants faster than bees with low hygienicity, and both molecules are strong ligands for hygienic behavior-associated odorant binding proteins (OBP16 and OBP18). Odorants that induce low levels of hygienic behavior, however, are weak ligands for these OBPs. We are therefore beginning to paint a picture of the molecular mechanism behind this complex behavior, using odorants associated with freeze-killed brood as a model.",3154,332,929,25.0

Multiple intragenic promoters and alternatively spliced exons are responsible for the formation of numerous isoforms. Many genetically-modified mouse models of PMS have been generated but most disrupt only some of the isoforms. In contrast, the vast majority of known SHANK3 mutations found in patients involve deletions that disrupt all isoforms. Here, we report the production and thorough behavioral characterization of a new mouse model in which all Shank3 isoforms are disrupted. Our mice are more severely affected than previously published models. While the deficits were typically more pronounced in homozygotes, an intermediate phenotype was observed for heterozygotes in many paradigms. As in other Shank3 mouse models, stereotypies, including increased grooming, were observed. Additionally, both sensory and motor deficits were detected in neonatal and adult mice. While social behaviors were not strongly impacted, Shank3-deficient mice displayed a strong escape behavior and avoidance of inanimate objects indicating increased novelty-induced anxiety. Similarly, increased freezing was observed during fear conditioning training and amygdala-dependent cued retrieval. Finally, deficits were observed in both initial training and reversal in the Barnes maze and in contextual fear memory that are memory tasks involving hippocampal-prefrontal circuits.

In humans and other mammals, touch sensation depends on thousands of diverse somatosensory neurons. By contrast, Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes have six gentle touch receptor neurons linked to simple behaviors. The classical touch assay uses an eyebrow hair to stimulate freely moving C. elegans, evoking evasive behavioral responses. While this assay has led to the discovery of genes required for touch sensation, it does not provide control over stimulus strength or position. Here, we present an integrated system for performing automated, quantitative touch assays that circumvents these limitations and incorporates automated measurements of behavioral responses. Highly Automated Worm Kicker (HAWK) unites microfabricated silicon force sensors and video analysis with real-time force and position control. Using this system, we stimulated animals along the anterior-posterior axis and compared responses in wild-type and spc-1(dn) transgenic animals, which have a touch defect due to expression of a dominant-negative α spectrin protein fragment. As expected from prior studies, delivering large stimuli anterior to the mid-point of the body evoked a reversal, but such a stimulus applied posterior to the mid-point evoked a speed-up. The probability of evoking a response of either kind depended on stimulus strength and location; once initiated, the magnitude and quality of both reversal and speed-up behavioral responses were uncorrelated with stimulus location, strength, or the absence or presence of the spc-1(dn) transgene. Wild-type animals failed to respond when the stimulus was applied near the mid-point.

By carefully balancing the payoffs and efforts with cooperating partner (s) we could either avoid or punish cheaters and stably maintain cooperation. Recent studies investigating the origin of this fairness sentiment have demonstrated that this psychological trait is not unique to humans, but also can be observed in other group-living primates, such as chimpanzees and capuchins, suggesting a convergent evolution of a sense of fairness, with cooperative social life being the selective pressure for it. The current study was designed to test this hypothesis by directly comparing the response to the outcome inequity in two of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, having different social systems, i.e. solitary and patrilocal multi-male multi-female groups. Unlike other inequity experiments, we used a prosocial choice apparatus with different reward distributions (advantageous / disadvantageous) to give subjects an active role of not-sharing foods if they considered it unfair. In addition to the choice, we also recorded the behavioral responses of the apes to the inequity. Throughout the experiments aversive emotional responses toward the disadvantageous inequity were only found in chimpanzees, but not in orangutans, supporting the convergent (or domain-specific) evolution of a sense of fairness. However, this aversion to the inequity did not lead the chimpanzees to actually make selfish choices, indirectly supporting the previous findings that chimpanzees employ a partner choice strategy rather than a punishment for fair cooperation. We also found that hierarchy seems to play an important role in the expression of aversion to inequity and prosocial tendency in chimpanzees.",1961,176,389,25.0

Dalzell",272641;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272641,"Steinernema carpocapsae is an entomopathogenic nematode that employs nictation and jumping behaviours to find host insects. We aimed to investigate the transcriptional basis of variant host-finding behaviours in the infective juvenile (IJ) stage of three S. carpocapsae strains (ALL, Breton and UK1). RNA-seq analysis revealed that whilst up to 28% of the S. carpocapsae transcriptome was differentially expressed (P&lt;0.0001) between strains, remarkably few of the most highly differentially expressed genes (&gt;2 log2 fold change, P&lt;0.0001) were from neuronal gene families. S. carpocapsae Breton displays increased chemotaxis toward the laboratory host Galleria mellonella, relative to the other strains. This correlates with the up-regulation of four srsx chemosensory GPCR genes, and a sodium transporter gene, asic-2, relative to both ALL and UK1 strains. The UK1 strain exhibits a decreased nictation phenotype relative to ALL and Breton strains, which correlates with co-ordinate up-regulation of neuropeptide like protein 36 (nlp-36), and down-regulation of an srt family GPCR gene, and a distinct asic-2-like sodium channel paralogue. To further investigate the link between transcriptional regulation and behavioural variation, we sequenced microRNAs across IJs of each strain. We have identified 283 high confidence microRNA genes, yielding 321 isomiR variants in S. carpocapsae, and find that up to 36% of microRNAs are differentially expressed (P&lt;0.0001) between strains. Many of the most highly differentially expressed microRNAs (&gt;2 log2 fold, P&lt;0.0001) are predicted to regulate a variety of neuronal genes that may contribute to variant host-finding behaviours. We have also found evidence for differential gene isoform usage between strains, which alters predicted microRNA interactions, and could contribute to the diversification of behaviour. These data provide deeper insight to the transcriptional landscape of behavioural variation in S. carpocapsae, underpinning efforts to functionally dissect the parasite host-finding apparatus.Author summary Steinernema carpocapsae is a lethal parasite of insects. In order to find and invade a host insect, the S. carpocapsae infective juvenile will typically stand upright, waving its anterior in the air as it searches for host-specific cues. When the infective juvenile senses insect volatile compounds and movement (both signals are required), it will attempt to jump towards the source of those stimuli. Whilst the jumping behaviour is unique to Steinernema species nematodes, nictation is a host-finding behaviour shared with other important parasites of medical and veterinary importance. We have found that different strains of S. carpocpsae use modified host-finding strategies, and that these behavioural differences correlate with gene expression patterns, identifying genes that may be crucial in regulating aspects of host-finding. We also assessed the complement of microRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate target gene expression. We found a surprising difference in the abundance of shared microRNAs between strains of S. carpocapsae; these differences also reveal expression differences that correlate with behavioural variation. Predicted microRNA target genes suggest that microRNA variation could significantly influence the behaviour of nematodes. Broadly, this study provides insight to the relationship between gene expression and behaviour, paving the way for detailed studies on gene function.",1556,173,613,23.0

Replicating our previous work, we show that following removal of the alpha male, beta males rapidly ascend the social hierarchy and attain dominant status by increasing aggression towards more subordinate individuals. Analysis of patterns of Fos immunoreactivity throughout the brain indicates that in individuals undergoing social ascent, there is increased activity in regions of the social behavior network, as well as the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the prefrontal cortex and areas of the hippocampus.

Often, bench scientists struggle with the most basic problem that there is currently no user-friendly, flexible, and open source software tool with which to watch and annotate these videos.Results We have created the VideoTagger tool to address these and many of the other associated challenges of video analysis. VideoTagger allows non-programming users to efficiently explore, annotate, and visualize large quantities of video data, within their existing experimental protocols. Further, it is built to accept programmed plugins written in Python, to enable seamless integration with other sophisticated computer-aided analyses.We tested VideoTagger ourselves, and have a growing base of users in other scientific disciplines. Capitalising on the unique features of VideoTagger to play back infinite lengths of video footage at various speeds, we annotated 39h of a Drosophila melanogaster lifespan video, at approximately 10-15x faster than real-time. We then used these labels to train a machine-learning plugin, which we used to annotate an additional 538h of footage automatically. In this way, we found that flies fall over spontaneously with increasing frequency as they age, and also spend longer durations struggling to right themselves. Ageing in flies is typically defined by length of life. We propose that this new mobility measure of ageing could help the discovery of mechanisms in biogerontology, refining our definition of what healthy ageing means in this extremely small, but widely used, invertebrate.Conclusions We show how VideoTagger is sufficiently flexible for studying lengthy and/or numerous video experiments, thus directly improving scientists’ productivity across varied domains.",2315,998,1254,13.0
1741,Small differences in learning speed for different food qualities can drive efficient collective foraging in ant colonies,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/274209v1,"F. B. Oberhauser, A. Koch, T. J. Czaczkes",274209;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/274209,"Social insects frequently make important collective decisions, such as selecting the best food sources. Many collective decisions are achieved via communication, for example by differential recruitment depending on resource quality. However, even species without recruitment can respond to a changing environment on collective level by tracking food source quality.We hypothesised that an apparent collective decision to focus on the highest quality food source can be explained by differential learning of food qualities. Ants may learn the location of higher quality food faster, with most ants finally congregating at the best food source.To test the effect of reward quality and motivation on learning in Lasius niger, we trained individual ants to find a reward of various sucrose molarities on one arm of a T-maze in spring and in autumn after one or four days of starvation.As hypothesised, ants learned fastest in spring and lowest in autumn, with reduced starvation leading to slower learning. Surprisingly, the effect of food quality and motivation on the learning speed of individuals which persisted in visiting the feeders was small. However, persistence rates varied dramatically: All ants in spring made all (6) return visits to all food qualities, in contrast to 33% of ants in autumn under low starvation.Fitting the empirical findings into an agent-based model revealed that even a tendency of ants to memorise routes to high quality food sources faster can result in ecologically sensible colony-level behaviour. Low motivation colonies are also choosier, due to increasing sensitivity to food quality.Significance statement Collective decisions of insects are often achieved via communication and/or other interactions between individuals. However, animals can also make collective decisions in the absence of communication.We show that foraging motivation and food quality can affect both route memory and the likelihood to return to the food source and thus mediate selective food exploitation. An agent-based model, implemented with our empirical findings, demonstrates that, at the collective level, even small differences in learning lead to ecologically sensible behaviour: mildly starved colonies are selective for high quality food while highly starved colonies exploit all food sources equally.We therefore suggest that non-interactive factors such as individual learning and the foraging motivation of a colony can mediate or even drive group level behaviour. Instead of accounting collective behaviour exclusively to social interactions, possible contributing individual processes should also be considered.",8927,130,422,23.0

For animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes, spatial familiarity can increase with increasing age/experience. To check whether this holds for individually foraging tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of the materials brought to the nest (building material, water or food) and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (respective to their nests) of known-age foragers from three natural colonies, each for three consecutive days. The average trip duration and time spent daily in foraging increased rapidly until about first four weeks of their life, during which they rarely brought food to their nest, although many of them brought building material and water. Thereafter, their average as well as per day duration of foraging trip started decreasing gradually. Nevertheless, their foraging efficiency and success for food kept on increasing monotonically with age. These results suggest that older wasps were more efficient in foraging despite spending less time doing so. With increasing age, wasps developed individual preferences for the direction of their outbound flights, increased directionality of their inbound trips as well as the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights, indicating development of spatial memory. We conclude that wasps acquire familiarity with their foraging landscape in their initial foraging phase and gradually develop robust memory for rewarding sites and routes to those sites, which enables them to increase their foraging capabilities.SUMMARY STATEMENT Contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, tropical social wasps invest weeks to get familiar with foraging landscapes during their early foraging lives. This eventually enables them to increase foraging gain with reduced effort.",877,133,246,40.0

Hayden",272260;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272260,"The demands of foraging are a major driver in the evolution of cognitive faculties. To successfully pursue a mobile prey that is attempting to avoid capture, the ability to predict its flight path can provide a crucial advantage. We hypothesized that, during pursuit, rhesus macaques exploit patterns in prey’s behavior to predict the prey’s future positions. We modeled behavior of three macaques in a joystick-controlled pursuit task in which prey follow simple escape algorithms that involve repulsion from the subject and from the walls of the virtual enclosure. We find that, even in this artificial task, macaques actively predict and aim towards prey’s future positions, increasing their foraging success. Their predictions are derived from the three core variables in Newtonian dynamics: position, velocity, and acceleration. Even after extensive training, subjects favored these principles and ignored other regularities in prey behavior. Most notably, they ignored the effects their own actions would have on the prey, despite extensive training and even though doing so would have further improved performance. We conjecture that subjects have a strong bias towards using physical principles to pursue fleeing prey, possibly reflecting an evolved physics module. The observed predictive behavior suggests that foraging demands facilitate the development of prospection.",1515,345,559,35.0

Stephan, Jakob Heinzle",270165;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/270165,"In the antisaccade task, subjects are instructed to saccade in the opposite direction of a peripheral visual cue (PVC). Importantly, several psychiatric disorders are associated with increased error rates in this paradigm. Despite this observation, there is no consensus about the mechanism behind antisaccade errors: while often explained as inhibition failures, some studies have suggested that errors are caused by deficits in the ability to initiate voluntary saccades. Using a computational model, we recently showed that under some conditions high latency or late errors can be explained by a race process between voluntary pro- and antisaccades. A limitation of our findings is that in our previous experiment the PVC signaled the trial type, whereas in most studies, subjects are informed about the trial type before the PVC is presented. We refer to these task designs as asynchronous (AC) and synchronous cues (SC) conditions. Here, we investigated to which extent differences in design affect the type and frequency of errors in the antisaccade task. Twenty-four subjects participated in mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials in both conditions. Our results demonstrate that error rates were highly correlated across task designs and a non-negligible fraction of them were classified as late errors in both conditions. In summary, our findings indicate that errors in the AC task are the result of both inhibition failures and inaccurate voluntary action initiation.",2126,249,589,40.0

Laboratory studies have provided elegant demonstrations of sib-mating avoidance, but small-scale bioassays often minimize the costs associated with mate finding and choice, which could lead to spurious findings.We used the hymenopteran parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens as a model organism, because previous laboratory studies revealed that sib-mating led to a 25% decrease in fertile offspring, and that sib-mating was partially avoided.Our study consisted of a mate choice experiment in laboratory cages to determine if kin discrimination occurs in this species. We further performed a field study in which 86 wild-caught males, 155 wild-caught females and their 226 daughters daughters were genotyped at eighteen microsatellite loci. With these field data, we reconstructed the genotype of each female’s mate and estimated the relatedness of each mating pair.Mate choice experiments confirmed that females are capable of discriminating kin. Time to mating depended on the frequency of female encounters with related and unrelated males. Contrary to previously published results, however, no sib-mating avoidance was detected. In the field, the effective rate of sib-mating did not differ from the probability that sibs encounter one other at random, which corroborates the absence of sib-mating avoidance. We also detected a weak but significant male bias in dispersal, which could reduce encounters between sibs.Our results suggest that, despite kin discrimination, V. canescens tolerates sib-mating in the field. The weak male-biased dispersal cannot explain entirely this pattern. This raises the question as to why kin discrimination is maintained in this species. It further calls into question the idea that inbreeding depression occurs in most species with single-locus complementary sex determination.",2292,381,1067,20.0

When the actions are based on sensory stimuli, an association is formed between the stimulus, the action and the reward. Computational, behavioral and neurobiological accounts of this process successfully explain simple stimulus-response learning. However, if the cue is multi-dimensional, identifying which of its features are relevant for the reward is not trivial, and the underlying cognitive process is poorly understood. To study this we adapted an intra-dimensional/ extra-dimensional set-shifting paradigm to train rodents on a multidimensional sensory discrimination task. In our setup, stimuli of different modalities (spatial, olfactory and visual) are combined into complex cues and manipulated independently. In each set, only a single stimulus dimension is relevant for reward. To distinguish between learning and decision-making we suggest a weighted attention model (WAM). It combines a learning model where each feature-dimension is reinforced separately with a decision rule that chooses an alternative according to a weighted average of learnt values, in which weight is associated with each dimension. We estimated the parameters of the WAM (decision weights, learning rate and noise) and demonstrated that is outperforms an alternative model in which a value learnt is assigned to each combination of features, or every state. Estimated decision weights of WAM reveal an experience-based bias in learning. The intra-dimensional set shift separated the decision weights. While in the first phase of the experiment the weights were roughly the same, in the second phase the weight on the dimension that was key to finding the reward became higher than others. After the extra-dimensional shift this dimension became irrelevant, however its decision weight remained high for the early learning stage in this last phase, providing an explanation for the poor performance of the animals. By the end of the phase when the rats performance improved, the weights for the two dimensions converged. Thus, estimated weights can be viewed as a possible way to quantify the experience-based bias.",981,207,256,17.0

Mills",270702;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/270702,"Introduction Knowledge of accurate weights of cattle is crucial for effective dosing of individual animals with medicine and for reporting antimicrobial usage metrics, amongst other uses. The most common weight for dairy cattle presented in current literature is 600 kg, but this is not evidenced by data. For the first time, we provide an evidence-based estimate of the average weight of UK dairy cattle to better inform decisions by farmers, veterinarians and the scientific community.Methods We collected data for 2,747 dairy cattle from 20 farms in the UK, 19 using Lely Automatic Milking Systems with weigh floors and 1 using a crush with weigh scales. These data covered farms with different breed types, including Holstein, Friesian, Holstein-Friesian and Jersey, as well as farms with dual purpose breeds and cross-breeds. Data were used to calculate a mean weight for dairy cattle by breed, and a UK-specific mean weight was generated by scaling to UK-specific breed proportions. Trends in weight by lactation number, DIM and production level were also explored using individual cattle-level data.Results Mean weight for adult dairy cattle included in this study was 617 kg (standard deviation (sd) 85.6 kg). Mean weight varied across breeds, with a range of 466 kg (sd=56.0 kg, Jersey) to 636 kg (sd=84.1, Holsteins). When scaled to UK breed proportions, the estimated mean UK dairy cattle weight was 620 kg. Overall, first-lactation heifers weighed 9% less than cows. Mean weight declined for the first 30 days post-calving, before steadily increasing. For cattle at peak production, mean weight increased with production level.Conclusions This study is the first to calculate a mean weight of adult dairy cattle in the UK based on on-farm data. Overall mean weight was higher than that most often proposed in the literature (600 kg). Evidence-informed weights are crucial as the UK works to better monitor and report metrics to monitor antimicrobial use and are useful to farmers and veterinarians to inform dosing decisions.",1305,145,820,24.0

Peter Henzi, Louise Barrett",270041;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/270041,"In mobile social groups, cohesion is thought to be driven by patterns of attraction at both the individual and group level. In long-lived species with high group stability and repeated interactions, such as baboons, individual-to-individual attractions have the potential to play a large role in group cohesion and overall movement patterns. In previous work, we used GPS mapping of a group of baboons in De Hoop, Western Cape, South Africa, to demonstrate the influence of such attractions on movement patterns. We also demonstrated the existence of emergent group-level structures, which arose as a consequence of individual social influence. Specifically, we found a core-periphery structure, in which a subset of influential animals exerted an influence on each other and those animals in the periphery, while those in the periphery were influenced by the core but did not exert any influence over others. Here, we use agent-based modelling of baboon groups to investigate whether this group-level structure has any functional consequences for foraging behaviour. By varying individual level attractions, we produced baboon groups that contained influence structures that varied from more to less centralized. Our results suggest that varying centrality affects both the ability of the group to detect resource structure in the environment, as well as the ability of the group to exploit these resources. Our models predict that foraging groups with more centralized social structures will show a reduction in detection and an increase in exploitation of resources in their environment, and will produce more extreme foraging outcomes. More generally, our results highlight the link between social and environmental structure on functional outcomes for mobile social groups of animals.",1153,186,407,24.0

Our experiments indicated that most bees needed two or more foraging trips to the new position before showing an updated dance duration. In addition, only a few bees significantly changed dance duration immediately, whereas most bees first produced intermediary durations. Double shift experiments showed that under certain conditions bees do not update dance duration but continued to perform dance duration for the previously visited feeder position.

Each of these primates uses stone hammers to crack open nuts in the wild, making them suitable for inter-species behavioural comparison. This work draws on published results to identify a distinct difference in the tool weight/food hardness curve between chimpanzees and the two monkey taxa, with the latter reaching an asymptote in mean tool weight of just over 1 kg regardless of increasing food hardness. In contrast, chimpanzees rapidly increase their tool weight in response to increasing hardness, selecting average masses over 5 kg to process the hardest nuts.

The monkeys looked longer when the face was upright than inverted only for the pictures containing unfamiliar person with front view. The other types of photographs did not cause inversion effect.

The stop-signal paradigm is a popular tool to study response inhibition. Participants perform a response time task (go task) and, occasionally, the go stimulus is followed by a stop signal after a variable delay, indicating subjects to withhold their response (stop task). The main interest of modeling is in estimating the unobservable stop-signal processing time, that is, the covert latency of the stopping process as a characterization of the response inhibition mechanism. In the independent race model the stop-signal task is represented as a race between stochastically independent go and stop processes. Without making any specific distributional assumptions about the processing times, the model allows to estimate the mean time to cancel a response. However, neurophysiological studies on countermanding saccadic eye movements have shown that neural correlates of go and stop processes consist of networks of mutually interacting gaze-shifting and gaze-holding neurons. This poses a major challenge in formulating linking propositions between the behavioral and neural findings. Here we propose a dependent race model that postulates perfect negative stochastic dependence between go and stop activations. The model is consistent with the concept of interacting processes while retaining the simplicity and elegance of the distribution-free independent race model. For mean data, the dependent model’s predictions remain identical to those of the independent model.

Ott,174763;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/174763,"Locusts are defined by their capacity to transform between two very distinct integrated phenotypes or ‘phases’ in response to changes in population density: a solitarious phase, which occurs when densities are low, and a gregarious phase, which arises as a consequence of crowding and can form very large and economically damaging swarms. The two phases differ fundamentally in their behaviour, physiology and morphology. A large body of work on the mechanistic basis of behavioural phase transitions has relied on multivariate logistic regression (LR) models to estimate the probability of behavioural gregariousness from multiple behavioural variables. Martín-Blázquez and Bakkali (2017, Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 163, 9–25) have recently proposed standardised LR models for estimating an overall ‘gregariousness level’ from a combination of behavioural and, unusually, morphometric variables. Here I develop a detailed argument to demonstrate that the premise of such an overall ‘gregariousness level’ is fundamentally flawed. Since locust phase transformations intrinsically entail a decoupling of behaviour and morphology, phase state cannot meaningfully be conflated onto a single axis. LR models that do so are therefore of very limited value for any analysis of phase transitions. I furthermore show why behavioural predictor variables should not be adjusted by measures of body size that themselves differ between phases. I discuss the models fitted by Martín-Blázquez and Bakkali (2017) to highlight potential pitfalls in statistical methodology that must be avoided when applying LR to the analysis of behavioural phase state. Finally, I reject the idea that ‘standardised models’ provide a valid shortcut to estimating phase state across different developmental stages, strains or species.

Critically, it has been theorized that IGEs constitute a large fitness target on which deleterious mutations can have pleiotropic effects, meaning that individuals carrying certain behavior-altering mutations can impose the fitness costs of those mutations on others comprising the broader social genome. Experimental data involving a mouse model support the existence of these IGE-amplified fitness losses; however, the underlying biological mechanisms that facilitate these remain unknown. In a mouse model of IGEs, we demonstrate that the Major Urinary Protein 20 pheromone, also called Darcin, produced by mice lacking the adhesion protein Neuroligin-3 acts as a vector to deleteriously modify the social behavior of wild-type mice. Additionally, we showed that lack of social interest on the part of Neuroligin-3 knockout mice is independent of their environment. These findings reveal a new role for mammalian pheromones in mediating the externalization of social deficits from one individual to others comprising the population through IGEs.Author Summary Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are mechanisms by which individuals of particular genotypes can influence the behavioral phenotype of individuals of different genotypes, sometimes disruptively, in instances where one member of the population carriers a deleterious behavior altering variant. Although disruptive IGEs have been demonstrated in mice, its underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms remain unknown. Using an IGEs mouse model, we demonstrated that the pheromone protein Major Urinary Protein 20, also named Darcin, is as a vector and target of social epistasis a specific type of IGEs. This finding reveals a new function for mammalian pheromones in mediating social epistasis to degrade group social behavior.",1470,246,712,21.0

While these is growing interest in understanding behavioral mechanisms in guppies, resources are sparse. As part of this study, we developed a neuroanatomical atlas of the guppy brain as a research community resource. Using this atlas, we found that neural activity in the preoptic area reflected social context, whereas individual differences in behavioral motivation paralleled activity in the posterior tuberculum and ventral telencephalon (teleost homologs of the ventral tegmental area and lateral septum, respectively).

One criticism of that study is that the visual suppression method used, forward and backward masking (FBM), may be too blunt in the way it interferes with visual processing to allow for unconscious forced-choice discrimination. To investigate this question we compared FBM directly to continuous flash suppression (CFS) in a two-interval forced choice task. Although CFS is popular, and may be thought of as a more powerful visual suppression technique, we found no difference in the degree of perceptual impairment between the two suppression types. To the extent that CFS impairs perception, both objective discrimination and subjective awareness are impaired to similar degrees under FBM. This pattern was consistently observed across 3 experiments in which various experimental parameters were varied.

Here, we propose that phenomenology in the visual periphery can be characterized by an inflated sense of perceptual capacity, as observers overestimate the quality of their perceptual inputs. Distinct from the well-known perceptual phenomenon of “filling-in” where perceptual content is generated or completed endogenously, inflation can be characterized by incorrect introspection at the subjective level. The perceptual content itself may be absent or weak (i.e., not necessarily filled-in), and yet such content is mistakenly regarded by the system as rich. Behaviorally, this can be reflected by metacognitive deficits in the degree to which confidence judgments track task accuracy, and decisional biases for observers to think particular items are present, even when they are not. In two experiments using paradigms which exploit unique attributes of peripheral vision (crowding and summary statistics), we provide evidence that both types of deficits are present in peripheral vision, as observers’ reports are marked by overconfidence in discrimination judgments and high numbers of false alarms in detection judgments. We discuss potential mechanisms which may be the cause of inflation and propose future experiments to further explore this unique sensory phenomenon.",2327,202,782,21.0

In this study we take advantage of genetic variation among captive zebra finch populations to examine variation in a population-level song trait: song variability. We find that zebra finch populations differ in levels of song variability. Domesticated T. g. castanotis populations displayed higher song diversity than more recently wild-derived populations of both zebra finch subspecies T. g. castanotis and T. g. guttata, the Timor zebra finch. To determine whether these differences could have a genetic basis, we cross-fostered domesticated T. g. castanotis and Timor zebra finches to Bengalese finches Lonchura striata domestica. Following cross-fostering, domesticated T. g. castanotis maintained a higher level of song diversity than T. g. guttata. We suggest that the high song variability of domesticated zebra finches may be a consequence of reduced purifying selection acting on song traits. Intraspecific differences in the mechanisms underlying song variability therefore represent an untapped opportunity for probing the mechanisms of song learning and production.",1405,140,687,23.0

However, animal posture typically has many degrees of freedom and behavioural dynamics vary on timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, presenting both technical and conceptual challenges. Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability.

However, learning stimulus-response associations solely via trial-and-error is often suboptimal, as in many settings dependencies among stimuli and responses can be exploited to increase learning efficiency. Previous studies have shown that in settings featuring such dependencies, humans typically engage high-level cognitive processes and employ advanced learning strategies to improve their learning efficiency. Here we analyze in detail the initial learning phase of a sample of human subjects (N = 85) performing a trial-and-error learning task with deterministic feedback and hidden stimulus-response dependencies. Using computational modeling, we find that the standard Q-learning model cannot sufficiently explain human learning strategies in this setting. Instead, newly introduced deterministic response models, which are theoretically optimal and transform stimulus sequences unambiguously into response sequences, provide the best explanation for 50.6% of the subjects. Most of the remaining subjects either show a tendency towards generic optimal learning (21.2%) or at least partially exploit stimulus-response dependencies (22.3%), while a few subjects (5.9%) show no clear preference for any of the employed models. After the initial learning phase, asymptotic learning performance during the subsequent practice phase is best explained by the standard Q-learning model. Our results show that human learning strategies in trial-and-error learning go beyond merely associating stimuli and responses via incremental reinforcement. Specifically during initial learning, high-level cognitive processes support sophisticated learning strategies that increase learning efficiency while keeping memory demands and computational efforts bounded. The good asymptotic fit of the Q-learning model indicates that these cognitive processes are successively replaced by the formation of stimulus-response associations over the course of learning.",1294,288,284,20.0

Participants were presented with two visual cues that separately predicted a common outcome and later asked for the outcome predicted by the compound of the two cues. Importantly, the cues’ similarity was varied between groups through changes in shape, spatial position, color, configuration and rotation. In variance with the predictions of these models, we observed similar and strong levels of summation in both groups across all manipulations of similarity (Experiments 1-5). The summation effect was significantly reduced by manipulations intended to impact assumptions about the causal independence of the cues forming the compound, but this reduction was independent of stimulus similarity (Experiment 6). These results are problematic for similarity-based models and can be more readily explained by rational approaches to causal learning.",1791,231,644,59.0

Factors corresponding to social behavior and anxiety were among the strongest predictors of nicotine intake and reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior. We also found many sex differences in behavioral measures.

Hoekstra",177782;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/177782,"Structures built by animals, such as nests, often can be considered extended phenotypes that facilitate the study of animal behaviour. For rodents, nest building is both an important form of behavioural thermoregulation and a critical component of parental care. Changes in nest structure or the prioritization of nesting behaviour are therefore likely to have consequences for survival and reproduction, and both biotic and abiotic environmental factors are likely to influence the adaptive value of such differences. Here we first develop a novel assay to investigate interspecific variation in the nesting behaviour of deer mice (genus Peromyscus). Using this assay, we find that, while there is some variation in the complexity of the nests built by Peromyscus mice, differences in the latency to begin nest construction are more striking. Four of the seven taxa examined here build nests within an hour of being given nesting material, but this latency to nest is not related to ultimate differences in nest structure, suggesting that the ability to nest is relatively conserved within the genus, but species differ in their prioritization of nesting behaviour. We also find that latency to nest is not correlated with body size, climate, or the construction of burrows that create microclimates. However, the four taxa with short nesting latencies all have monogamous mating systems, suggesting that differences in nesting latency may be related to social environment. This detailed characterization of nesting behaviour within the genus provides an important foundation for future studies of the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of behaviour.",1752,479,882,40.0

Foraging is a task done by older workers in honey bee colonies. Foragers use the waggle dance behaviour to inform and recruit nest mates to food sources in the environment. The recruitment process incorporates information about the food reward, the colony food stores and the environmental food availability and plays a major role in ensuring efficient exploitation of the food sources available to the colony. However, the role that individual foragers play in driving recruitment is largely unexplored. We observed the dance activity of individual foragers from the same foraging group and showed that there are consistent inter-individual differences within a foraging group leading to a division of labour in the recruitment activity. Next, we studied the effect of changing social interactions on these individual differences. Removing foragers from the group led to an increase in the dance activity of the group of remaining foragers. This was mainly driven by an increase in the dance activity of certain individuals within the foraging groups. In contrast, allowing recruits to join the foraging group had a strong negative effect on the dance activity of all the individual foragers. Our study shows that there is a fine scale division of labour in the recruitment activity within foraging groups and that this is further regulated by changing social interactions. Thus, a complex interplay between individual differences and social interactions drive recruitment activity in honey bees.",1789,151,599,20.0

Despite these well documented effects in humans, extent to which affective processes change in nonhuman animals, and in particular nonhuman primates – is unclear. As a first step towards developing a model for human affective aging in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we tested aged, surgically menopausal aged and middle-aged gonadally intact female rhesus monkeys on a classic index of affective reactivity in monkeys, the Human Intruder task. The Human Intruder task evaluates behavioral responses to varying levels of threat. Aged, surgically menopausal monkeys received hormone replacement therapy consisting of a cyclic estradiol regimen, or vehicle injections as a control. Average responsivity to threat did not vary by condition, but middle aged monkeys and aged monkeys on estradiol were more reactive to the most potent level of threat than to a moderate level of threat, replicating previously published results in other age groups and male monkeys. In contrast, aged monkeys not on estradiol did not show such calibration to threat level. These findings suggest that estrogen may be important for maintaining more youthful affective responding.

In the current study, conditionally targeting either serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or Emx1-expressing neurons, we show that the cell type-specific ablation of Ntng1 within the excitatory circuits of either cortex or thalamus does not have a profound impact on the EF but rather affects its certain modalities, i.e. impulsivity and/or selective attention, modulated by cognitive demand. Several mice of both conditional genotypes simultaneously occupy either top or bottom parameter-specific behavioral ranks, indicative of a subject-unique antagonistic either proficit or deficit of function within the same behavior. Employing genotype-attributable behavior variability as a phenotypic trait, we deduce, that Ntng1-parsed excitatory pathways contribute but do not fully reconstitute the attention-impulsivity phenotypes, associated with the mouse EF deficit.

In the two experiments reported here, we asked participants to reproduce a previously learned 30 second target duration while watching a movie that contained eventful and uneventful intervals. In Experiment 2, reproduction also occurred during “blank movies” while watching a fixation. In both experiments, participants made shorter and more variable reproductions while simultaneously watching eventful as compared to uneventful movie intervals. Moreover, in Experiment 2, the longest reproductions were produced when participants had to watch the blank movies, which contained no events.

This difference implies that humans may process or represent temporal durations differently than other species. Here we present a behavioral model that reconciles the differences by demonstrating that rats’ performance on this task is driven not only by their noisy estimates of duration, but also by the temporally-discounted value of future rewards. The model correctly predicts shifts in the bisection point induced by unequal rewards and explains otherwise-paradoxical psychometric reversals documented three decades ago. Furthermore, as predicted by the model, we found that modifying the Temporal Bisection Task to eliminate the temporally-discounted reward component shifted the rats’ bisection point from the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean, thus bringing the rat results into line with the human results. We therefore propose that humans and rats (and perhaps other non-human subjects as well) process temporal information similarly, and that the difference between them in the Temporal Bisection Task may be simply due to rats weighing temporal discounting of future rewards more strongly than humans.",1997,229,748,34.0

White",175992;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/175992,"Lay Summary An outstanding challenge for the study of colour traits is how best to use “colour spaces” to represent their visual perception, particularly when asking questions of colour-difference (e.g. the (dis)similarity of males and females, mimics and models, or sister species, to a given viewer). We use simulations to show that existing methods fail to statistically and biologically estimate the separation of groups in colour space, and we suggest a flexible, robust, alternative that avoids those pitfalls. Colour in nature presents a striking dimension of variation, though understanding its function and evolution largely depends on our ability to capture the perspective of relevant viewers. This goal has been radically advanced by the development and widespread adoption of colour spaces, which allow for the viewer-subjective estimation of colour appearance. Most studies of colour in camouflage, aposematism, sexual selection, and other signalling contexts draw on these models, with the shared analytical objective of estimating how similar (or dissimilar) colour samples are to a given viewer. We summarise popular approaches for estimating the separation of samples in colour space, and use a simulation-based approach to test their efficacy with common data structures. We show that these methods largely fail to estimate the separation of colour samples by neglecting (i) the statistical distribution and within-group variation of the data, and/or (ii) the discriminability of groups relative to the observer’s visual capabilities. Instead, we formalize the two questions that must be answered to establish both the statistical presence and theoretical magnitude of colour differences, and propose a two-step, permutation-based approach that achieves this goal. Unlike previous methods, our suggested approach accounts for the multidimensional nature of visual model data, and is robust against common colour-data features such as heterogeneity and outliers. We demonstrate the pitfalls of current methods and the flexibility of our suggested framework using an example from the literature, with recommendations for future inquiry.",2581,399,1000,33.0

To investigate this phenomenon under controlled conditions, we studied the acquisition of conditioned nausea using a distinct environment paired with an emetic drug in healthy young adults. We measured two indices of conditioning: i) conditioned place aversion, and ii) conditioned drug-like (nausea) responses. Healthy volunteers (N=32) first rated their preference for two testing rooms, and then underwent four conditioning sessions in which they received either syrup of ipecac (5 ml) or placebo. A Paired Group (PG; N=17) always received ipecac in their initially preferred room and placebo in the other, while an Unpaired Group (UG; N=15) received ipecac and placebo in both rooms. Conditioned responses were assessed with i) time spent in each room, ii) room liking and preference, and iii) feelings of nausea in each room. There was no evidence of conditioned place aversion as measured by either time spent or ratings of room liking. However, the PG did report a small increase in nausea in the ipecac-paired room. Although the conditioned responses in this study were not robust, this procedure is a first step towards studying conditioned aversive drug responses in humans, which will enable development of future studies to prevent or treat anticipatory nausea.",929,109,185,18.0

In populations evolving culture, such may be the role of high-magnitude innovators: individuals whose innovations are a major departure from the population’s existing behavioural repertoire. Their effect on cultural evolution is twofold: they produce innovations that constitute a ‘cultural leap’, and, once copied, their innovations may induce further innovations by conspecifics (socially induced innovations), as they explore the new behaviour themselves. I use computer simulations to study the co-evolution of independent innovations, socially induced innovations, and innovation magnitude, and show that while socially induced innovation is assumed here to be less costly than independent innovation, it does not readily evolve. When it evolves, it may in some conditions select against independent innovation and lower its frequency, despite it requiring independent innovation in order to operate; at the same time, however, it leads to much faster cultural evolution. These results confirm the role of high-magnitude innovators as keystones, and suggest a novel explanation for low frequency of independent innovation.",958,116,345,25.0

We observed distinct clusters in movement patterns over 30 min, which indicates that termites have multiple innate modes of movement. The use of these modes is biased among castes, among which neotenics had a caste-specific mode and soldiers moved more actively than workers or neotenics. These caste biases may reflect different adaptive responses to social isolation. Our study provides a basis for a deeper understanding of the roles of individual movements in social behaviors.Summary Statement Movement patterns of termites in isolation were described for different castes.

Our method eclipses traditional model comparison techniques by using information theory to characterize model predictions for how decision makers should actively sample information. These analyses capture how sampling affects learning and how learning affects decisions on subsequent trials. We develop and test model-based active learning algorithms for both Take-The-Best and logistic regression. Our findings reveal that people largely follow a weight-based learning strategy rather than a rank-based strategy, even in cases where their preference decisions are better predicted by the Take-The-Best heuristic.

SummaryActive sensing using light, or active photolocation, is only known from deep sea and nocturnal fish with chemiluminescent “search” lights. Bright irides in diurnal fish species have recently been proposed as a potential analogue. Here, we contribute to this discussion by testing whether iris radiance is actively modulated. The focus is on behaviourally controlled iris reflections, called “ocular sparks”. The triplefin Tripterygion delaisi can alternate between red and blue ocular sparks, allowing us to test the prediction that spark frequency and hue depend on background hue and prey presence. In a first experiment, we found that blue ocular sparks were significantly more often “on” against red backgrounds, and red ocular sparks against blue backgrounds, particularly when copepods were present. A second experiment tested whether hungry fish showed more ocular sparks, which was not the case. Again, background hue resulted in differential use of ocular spark types. We conclude that iris radiance through ocular sparks in T. delaisi is not a side effect of eye movement, but adaptively modulated in response to the context under which prey are detected. We discuss the possible alternative functions of ocular sparks, including an as yet speculative role in active photolocation.",9798,273,587,24.0

Both are complex morphological traits and both can be easily assessed from frontal and lateral projection of a human face. Interestingly, examination of mutual relations between the frontal and lateral dimensions of these markers has so far received little attention in published research.Methods In our cross-cultural study, we used geometric morphometric data from male and female faces from Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, and the Czech Republic, and analysed correlations between frontal and lateral measurements of averageness and degree of maleness/femaleness, i.e. individual variation in features that characterize sexual dimorphism. We also analysed whether the association between frontal and lateral measurements differs in men and women.Results In general, our results showed a moderate correlation in sexually dimorphic features between lateral and frontal facial configuration in both sexes, while frontal and lateral facial averageness was moderately correlated only in women. This pattern was less consistent when individual populations were analysed separately.Conclusions Referring to the multiple signalling theory, we propose that especially in women, lateral/frontal correlations support a hypothesis of redundancy of information provided by the frontal and lateral dimension of a given facial attractiveness marker. The absence of a significant correlation in male facial averageness suggests that frontal and lateral averageness may convey different information about an individual.",1568,204,552,25.0

We characterized the internal structure of fighting behaviors by developing a machine learning pipeline that measures and classifies the behavior of individual unmarked animals on a sub-second timescale. This allowed us to quantify several previously hidden features of zebrafish fighting strategies. We found strong correlations between the velocity of the attacker and the defender indicating a dynamic matching of approach and avoidance efforts consistent with the cumulative assessment model of aggression. While velocity matching was ubiquitous, the spatial dynamics of attacks showed phase-specific differences. Contest phase attacks were characterized by a paradoxical side-ways attraction of the retreating animal towards the attacker suggesting that the defender combines avoidance maneuvers with display maneuvers. Post-resolution attacks lacked display-like features and the the defender was avoidance-focused. From the perspective of the winner, game theory modeling further suggested that highly energetically costly post resolution attacks occurred because the winner was trying to increase its relative dominance over the loser.

It has been suggested that certain symptoms of schizophrenia, including changes in olfactory functions, are in fact symptoms of toxoplasmosis that can be easily detected in schizophrenics only due to the increased prevalence of toxoplasmosis in this population. Schizophrenics have impaired identification of odors and lower sensitivity of odor detection. Here we searched for differences in olfactory functions between 62 infected and 61 noninfected non-schizophrenic subjects. The infected men scored better in the standard odor-identification test. The infected women rated all smells as more intensive while the infected men rated nearly all smells as less intensive. Infected women rated the pleasantness of the smell of undiluted cat urine as higher than the non-infected women and the opposite was true for the men (the opposite direction shifts in men and women were described earlier for highly diluted cat urine).

Our results indicated that in contrast to the previous reports, paramecium can only associate higher light intensities with cathodal stimulation and it cannot associate lower light intensities with cathodal stimulation. These results found to be in line with the predictions of the previously proposed model for the molecular mechanisms of learning in paramecium which depends on the effects of cathodal shocks on the interplay between Cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration and phototactic behavior of paramecium.",2631,653,1505,9.0

Female mice carrying this allele displayed an exacerbated paracopulatory behavior, culminating in a severe mutilation of the studs’ external genitals. To unequivocally demonstrate that this intriguing phenotype was indeed caused by an illegitimate function of the HOXD10 protein, we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to induced a microdeletion into the homeobox of the Hoxd10 gene in cis with the HoxDAfc allele [2]. Females carrying this novel HoxDDel(1-9)d10hd allele no longer mutilate males. We conclude that a brain malfunction leading to a severe pathological behavior can be caused by the mere binding to DNA of a transcription factor expressed ectopically. We also show that in HoxDAfc mice, Hoxd10 was expressed in cells containing Gad1 and Cck transcripts, corroborating our proposal that a small fraction of GABAergic neurons in adult hippocampus may participate to some aspects of female courtship.",2226,139,317,8.0

Common European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, show states of quiescence during which they meet the last two of these three criteria, yet also show spontaneous bursts of arm and eye movements that accompany rapid changes in chromatophore patterns in the skin. Here we report that this rapid-eye-movement (REM)-like state is cyclic in nature. Iterations of the REM-like state last 2.42 ± 0.22 min (±SE) and alternate with 34.01 ± 1.49 min of the quiescent sleep-like state. These states alternate for durations lasting 176.89 ± 36.71 min. We found clear evidence that this REM-like state (i) occurs in animals younger than previously reported; (ii) follows an ultradian pattern; (iii) includes intermittent dynamic chromatophore patterning, representing fragments of normal patterning seen in the waking state for a wide range of signaling and camouflage; and (iv) shows variability in the intensity of expression of these skin patterns between and within individuals. These data suggest that cephalopods, which are molluscs with an elaborate brain and complex behavior, possess a sleep-like state that resembles behaviorally the vertebrate REM sleep state, although the exact nature and mechanism of this form of sleep may differ from that of vertebrates.",1715,147,456,23.0

Despite its relative simplicity, there are still no reports of generative models that can capture essential differences between even well-described mutant strains. Here we show that a multilayer recurrent neural network (RNN) can produce diverse behaviours that are difficult to distinguish from real worms’ behaviour and that some of the artificial neurons in the RNN are interpretable and correlate with observable features such as body curvature, speed, and reversals.

It is of great importance to characterize the behavioral performance of w1118 flies because this would provide a baseline from which the effect of the gene of interest could be differentiated. Little work has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w1118 flies. Here we show that pulsed light stimulation increased the regularity of walking trajectories of w1118 flies in circular arenas. We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures. Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of crossing over the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed light stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect of mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic light stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w1118 flies and an unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying w1118 isogenic background.",1945,343,644,27.0

Farine",159038;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/159038,"The potential for behaviours to spread via cultural transmission has profound implications for our understanding of social dynamics and evolution. Several studies have provided empirical evidence that local traditions can be maintained in animal populations via conformist learning (i.e. copying the majority). A conformist bias can be characterized by a sigmoidal relationship between a behavior’s prevalence in the population and an individual’s propensity to adopt that behavior. For this reason, the presence of conformist learning in a population is often inferred from a sigmoidal acquisition curve in which the overall rate of adoption for the behavior is taken as the dependent variable. However, the validity of sigmoidal acquisition curves as evidence for conformist learning has recently been challenged by models suggesting that such curves can arise via alternative learning rules that do not involve conformity. We review these models, and find that the proposed alternative learning mechanisms either rely on faulty or unrealistic assumptions, or apply only in very specific cases. We therefore recommend that sigmoidal acquisition curves continue to be taken as evidence for conformist learning. Our paper also highlights the importance of understanding the generative processes of a model, rather than only focusing solely on the patterns produced. By studying these processes, our analysis suggests that current practices by empiricists have provided robust evidence for conformist transmission in both humans and non-human animals.",1798,218,519,12.0

Can people create novel vocalizations that are comprehensible to naïve listeners without the use of prior conventions? To test this capacity, we launched a contest in which participants submitted a set of non-linguistic vocalizations for 30 meanings spanning actions, humans, animals, inanimate objects, properties, quantifiers and demonstratives. The winner – who received a monetary prize – was judged by the ability of naïve listeners to successfully infer the meanings of the vocalizations. We report the results from the contest, along with a series of experiments and analyses designed to evaluate the vocalizations for: 1) their comprehensibility to naïve listeners; 2) the degree to which they resembled their meanings, i.e., were iconic; 3) agreement between producers and listeners in what constitutes an iconic vocalization; and 4) whether iconicity helps naïve listeners learn the vocalizations as category labels. The results show that contestants were able to create iconic vocalizations for a wide array of semantic domains, and that these vocalizations were largely comprehensible to naïve listeners, as well as easier to learn as category labels. These findings provide a compelling demonstration of the extent to which iconic vocalizations can enable interlocutors to establish understanding through vocalizations in the absence of conventions. This suggests the possibility that, prior to the advent of full-blown spoken languages, people could have used iconic vocalizations to ground a spoken vocabulary with considerable semantic breadth.",1274,195,577,43.0

However, despite the great progress in the field of mosquito olfaction and chemo-detection, little is known that how the sex-specific specialization of the olfactory system enables adult female mosquitoes to derive and manage complex blood feeding associated behavioral responses. A comprehensive RNAseq analysis of prior and post blood meal olfactory system of An. culicifacies mosquito revealed that a minor but unique change in the nature and regulation of key olfactory genes play a pivotal role in managing diverse behavioral responses. Age dependent transcriptional profiling demonstrated that adult female mosquito’s chemosensory system gradually learned and matured to drive the host-seeking and blood feeding behavior at the age of 5-6 days. A zeitgeber time scale expression analysis of Odorant Binding Proteins (OBPs) unravels unique association with a late evening to midnight peak biting time. Blood meal-induced switching of unique sets of OBP genes and Odorant Receptors (ORs) expression coincides with the change in the innate physiological status of the mosquitoes. Blood meal follows up experiments provide enough evidence that how a synergistic and concurrent action of OBPs-ORs may drive ‘prior and post blood meal’ complex behavioral events. Finally, tissue-specific gene expression analysis and molecular modelling predicted two uncharacterized novel sensory appendages proteins (SAP-1 &amp; SAP2) unique to An. culicifacies mosquito and may play a central role in the host-seeking behavior.Significance Evolution and adaptation of blood feeding behavior not only favored the reproductive success of adult female mosquito but also make them an important disease vectors. Immediately after emergence, an environmental exposure may favor the broadly tuned olfactory system of mosquitoes to derive complex behavioral responses. But, how these olfactory derived genetic factors manage female specific ‘pre and post’ blood meal associated complex behavioral responses are not well known. We unraveled synergistic actions of olfactory factors governs an innate to prime learning strategy to facilitate rapid blood meal acquisition and downstream behavioral activities.

Here, we present an experiment in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in which we increased the parental care of females by presenting them, but not their mates, with additional nestling begging calls using automated playbacks. We performed this experiment in two populations differing in future breeding opportunities and thus the intensity of conflict over current parental care. We found that in response to a temporary increase in female parental effort, males in the northern population with lower sexual conflict matched the increased effort, whereas males in the southern population did not. We also found that increases in parental care during playbacks were driven by the females (i.e., females initiated the increased effort and their mates followed them) in the northern population but not the southern population. These results support the idea that with incomplete information about the brood value and need, cues or signals from the partner might become important in coordinating parental care.",941,133,247,31.0

Participants consistently chose compositional (over non-compositional) extrapolations and interpolations of functions. Experiments designed to elicit priors over functional patterns revealed an inductive bias for compositional structure. Compositional functions were perceived as subjectively more predictable than non-compositional functions, and exhibited other signatures of predictability, such as enhanced memorability and reduced numerosity.

These nests are actively ventilated by individual bees which fan their wings at the nest entrance when the local air temperature exceeds a threshold. Here we show that colonies with relatively large nest entrances use an emergent ventilation strategy where fanning bees self-organize to form fanning groups, separating regions of continuous inflow and outflow. The observed spatio-temporal patterns correlate the air velocity and air temperature along the entrances to the distribution of fanning bees. A mathematical model that couples these variables to known fanning behavior of individuals recapitulates their collective dynamics. Additionally, the model makes predictions about the temporal stability of the fanning group as a function of the temperature difference between the environment and the nest. Consistent with these predictions, we observe that the fanning groups drift, cling to the entrance boundaries, break-up and reform as the ambient temperature varies over a period of days. Overall, our study shows how honeybees use flow-mediated communication to self-organize into a steady-state in fluctuating environments.",1538,132,1100,13.0

The most influential explanation is that they search for patterns in the random sequence of outcomes.

We collected behavioural data from 84 young adult participants who performed a probability learning task wherein the majority outcome was rewarded with 0.7 probability, and analysed the data using a reinforcement learning model that searches for patterns. Model simulations indicated that pattern search, exploration, recency (discounting early experiences), and forgetting may impair performance.Our analysis estimated that 85% (95% HDI [76, 94]) of participants searched for patterns and believed that each trial outcome depended on one or two previous ones. The estimated impact of pattern search on performance was, however, only 6%, while those of exploration and recency were 19% and 13% respectively.

Balleine",211664;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/211664,"State-space and action representations form the building blocks of decision-making processes in the brain; states map external cues to the current situation of the agent whereas actions provide the set of motor commands from which the agent can choose to achieve specific goals. Although these factors differ across environments, it is not currently known whether or how accurately state and action representations are acquired by the agent because previous experiments have typically provided this information a priori through instruction or pre-training. Here we show that, in the absence of such a priori knowledge, state and action representations adapt to reflect the structure of the world. We used a sequential decision-making task in rats in which they were required to pass through multiple states before reaching the goal, and for which the number of states and how they map onto external cues were not known a priori. We found that, early in training, animals selected actions as if the task was not sequential and outcomes were the immediate consequence of the most proximal action. During the course of training, however, rats recovered the true structure of the environment and made decisions based on the expanded state-space, reflecting the multiple stages of the task. We found a similar pattern with actions; early in training animals only considered the execution of single actions whereas, after training, they created useful action sequences that expanded the set of available actions. We conclude that the profile of choices shows a gradual shift from simple representations of actions and states to more complex structures compatible with the structure of the world.",1163,164,416,36.0

Exploring the degree to which pollinators exhibit flexibility in foraging behavior will add to a mechanistic understanding of how pollinators can impact selection on plant traits. Although plants have evolved suites of floral traits to attract pollinators, flower color is a particularly important aspect of the floral display. Some pollinators show strong innate color preference, but many pollinators display flexibility in preference due to learning associations between rewards and color, or due to variable perception of color in different environments or plant communities. This study examines the flexibility in flower color preference of two groups of native butterfly pollinators under natural field conditions. Our study reveals that pipevine swallowtails and skippers, the predominate pollinators of the two native Texas Phlox species, display distinct patterns of color preferences across different contexts. Pipevine swallowtails exhibit highly flexible color preferences and likely utilize other floral traits to make foraging decisions. In contrast, skippers have consistent color preferences and likely use flower color as a primary cue for foraging. As a result of this variation in color preference flexibility, the two pollinator groups impose concordant selection on flower color in some contexts but discordant selection in other contexts. This variability could have profound implications for how flower traits respond to pollinator-mediated selection. Our findings suggest that studying dynamics of behavior in natural field conditions is important for understanding plant-pollinator interactions.",1198,182,283,9.0

One intriguing consequence of imitation in primates is that it promotes positive social feedback from the imitated toward the imitator. This suggests that imitation in primates may facilitate positive social interactions, but few studies have tracked imitation in socially housed primates. Here, we designed a novel ethogram to characterize imitation between conspecifics, to better understand whether imitation is associated with affiliation between primates in a semi-natural setting.Materials and Methods In this study, 15 juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were observed at the California National Primate Research Center. Using focal sampling, frequencies of imitative events (e.g. following, postural mimicry, etc.) by the focal were observed over a course of 12 weeks. In separate observations, focal social behavior (e.g. aggression, play, etc.) was also observed.Results Subjects that exhibited higher degrees of imitation were not necessarily more prosocial, but, consistent with our hypothesis, they received significantly more play overtures from social partners (p&lt;.01). In addition, imitation rates generally decrease with age.Conclusions Together, these results suggest that imitation is associated with receiving positive social behavior in a complex, semi-natural setting in primates, and that imitation may be more common in adolescence as opposed to adulthood. These preliminary results in a small sample set represent an important step in characterizing imitation in context of social interactions during development. Tracking these behaviors over time will elucidate whether imitation is directly recruiting these positive social interactions, as has been demonstrated in captivity.",1159,151,231,21.0

The operant equipment necessary for measuring affective phenotypes is typically expensive, proprietary to commercial entities, and bulky which can render adequately sized mouse cohorts as cost-prohibitive.

However, among the vast number of studies on visual specializations in aquatic animals, only a few have focused on small benthic fishes that occupy a heterogeneous and spatially complex visual environment. This study investigates the general retinal anatomy including the topography of both the photoreceptor and ganglion cell populations and estimates the spatial resolving power of the eye of the Mediterranean triplefin Tripterygion delaisi. Retinal wholemounts were prepared to systematically and quantitatively analyze photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cell densities using design-based stereology. To further examine the retinal structure, we also used magnetic resonance imaging and histological examination of retinal cross sections. Observations of the triplefin's eyes revealed them to be highly mobile, allowing them to view the surroundings without body movements. A rostral aphakic gap and the elliptical shape of the eye extend its visual field rostrally and allow for a rostro-caudal accommodatory axis, enabling this species to focus on prey at close range. Single and twin cones dominate the retina and are consistently arranged in one of two regular patterns, which may enhance motion detection and color vision. The retina features a prominent, dorso-temporal, convexiclivate fovea with an average density of 104,400 double and 30,800 single cones per mm2, and 81,000 retinal ganglion cells per mm2.

However, it is largely unknown how insights obtained from observation compare with insights gained from trial-and-error, in particular in terms of their robustness. We use aversive reinforcement to train “experimenter” zebra finches to discriminate between auditory stimuli in the presence of an “observer” finch. We find that experimenters are slow to successfully discriminate the stimuli but immediately generalize their ability to a new set of similar stimuli. By contrast, observers subjected to the same task instantly discriminate the initial stimulus set, but require more time for successful generalization. Drawing upon machine learning insights, we suggest that observer learning has evolved to rapidly absorb sensory statistics without pressure to minimize neural resources, whereas learning from experience is endowed with a form of regularization that enables robust inference.",1119,118,290,38.0

Watanabe, Yuuki Kawabata",203828;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/203828,"Animal-borne accelerometers are effective tools for quantifying the kinematics of animal behaviors, such as swimming, running, and flying, under natural conditions. However, quantifying burst movements of small and agile aquatic animals (e.g., small teleost fish), such as during predatory behavior, or while fleeing, remains challenging. To capture the details of burst movements, accelerometers need to sample at a very high frequency, which will inevitably shorten the duration of the recording or increase the size of the device. To overcome this problem, we developed a high-frequency acceleration data-logger that can be triggered by a manually-defined acceleration threshold, thus allowing the selective measurement of animal burst movements. We conducted experiments under laboratory and field conditions to examine the performance of the logger. The laboratory experiment using red seabream (Pagrus major) showed that the new logger could measure the kinematics of their escape behaviors (i.e., body beat cycles and maximum acceleration values). The field experiment using free-swimming yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) showed that the loggers trigger correctly (i.e., of the 18 burst movements, 17 were recorded by the loggers). We suggest that this new logger can be applied to measure the burst movements of various small and agile animals, whose movements may be otherwise difficult to measure.",999,136,355,24.0

Zacks",201939;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/201939,"Two experiments examined adult age differences in the use of memory to comprehend changes in everyday activities. Participants viewed movies depicting an actor performing activities on two fictive days in her life. Some activities were repeated across days, other activities were repeated with a changed feature (e.g., waking up to an alarm clock or a phone alarm), and a final set of activities was performed on Day 2 only. After a one-week delay, participants completed a cued recall test for the activities of Day 2. Unsurprisingly, exact repetition boosted final recall. More surprising, features that changed from Day 1 to Day 2 were remembered approximately as well as features that were only presented on Day 2—showing an absence of proactive interference and in some cases proactive facilitation. Proactive facilitation was strongly related to participants’ ability to detect and recollect the changes. Younger adults detected and recollected more changes than older adults, which in part explained older adults’ differential deficit in memory for changed activity features. We propose that this pattern may reflect observers’ use of episodic memory to make predictions during the experience of a new activity, and that when predictions fail, this triggers processing that benefits subsequent episodic memory. Disruption of this chain of processing could play a role in age-related episodic memory deficits.",1268,296,572,62.0

These methods have multiple advantages over direct observations and manual data input as they reduce bias related to human perception and fatigue, and deliver more extensive and complete data sets that enhance statistical power. One major challenge that automation can overcome is the observation of many individuals at once, enabling whole-group or whole-population tracking.We provide a detailed description for implementing an automated system for tracking birds. Our system uses printed, machine-readable codes mounted on backpacks. This simple, yet robust, tagging system can be used simultaneously on multiple individuals to provide data on bird identity, position and directionality. Further, because our codes and backpacks are printed on paper, they are very lightweight.We describe the implementation of this automated system on two flocks of zebra finches. We test different camera options, and describe their advantages and disadvantages. We show that our method is reliable, relatively easy to implement and monitor, and with proper handling, has proved to be safe for the birds over long periods of time. Further, we highlight how using single-board computers to control the frequency and duration of image capture makes this system affordable, flexible, and adaptable to a range of study systems.The ability to automate the measurement of individual positions has the potential to significantly increase the power of both observational and experimental studies. The system can capture both detailed interactions (using video recordings) and repeated observations (e.g. once per second for the entire day) of individuals over long timescales (months or potentially years).

It has been proposed that the native gut microflora may serve as a quasi-endogenous pool of somnogenic bacterial cell wall products given their quantity and close proximity to the intestinal portal. This proposal suggests that deliberate manipulation of the host's intestinal flora may elicit changes in host sleep behavior. To test this possibility, we evaluated 24 h of sleep-wake behavior after depleting the gut microbiota with a 14 d broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen containing high doses of ampicillin, metronidazole, neomycin, and vancomycin. High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene was used to confirm depletion of fecal bacteria and sleep-wake vigilance states were determined using videosomnography techniques based on previously established behavioral criteria shown to highly correlate with standard polysomnography-based methods. Additionally, considering that germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice have been earlier shown to display increased locomotor activity, and since locomotor activity has been used as a reliable proxy of sleep, we suspected that the elevated locomotor activity previously reported in these animals may reflect an unreported reduction in sleep behavior. To examine this potential relationship, we also quantified locomotor activity on a representative subsample of the same 24 h of video recordings using the automated video-tracking software ANY-maze. We found that antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota reduced nocturnal sleep, but not diurnal sleep. Likewise, antibiotic-treated mice showed increased nocturnal locomotor activity, but not diurnal locomotor activity. Taken together, these results support a link between the gut microbiome and nocturnal sleep and locomotor physiology in adult mice. Additionally, our findings indicate that antibiotics may be insomnogenic via their ability to diminish gut-derived bacterial somnogens. Given that antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in human medicine, these findings have important implications for clinical practice with respect to prolonged antibiotic therapy, insomnia, and other idiopathic sleep-wake and circadian-rhythm disorders affecting an estimated 50-70 million people in the United States alone.Highlights- 14 d broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment effectively depletes the gut microbiota.- Gut microbiota depletion reduces nocturnal sleep, but not diurnal sleep.- Gut microbiota depletion increases nocturnal locomotion, but not diurnal locomotion.- Antibiotics may be insomnogenic: implications for idiopathic sleep disorders.",5190,499,1323,30.0

Traditionally, music research has been split in two fields. Some scientists focused on musicality, namely the human biocognitive predispositions for music, with an emphasis on cross-cultural similarities. Other scholars investigated music, seen as cultural product, focusing on the large variation in world musical cultures. Recent experiments found deep connections between music and musicality, reconciling these opposing views. Here we address the question of how individual cognitive biases affect the process of cultural evolution of music. Data from two experiments is analyzed using two different, complementary techniques. In the experiments, participants hear drumming patterns and imitate them. These patterns are then given to the same or another participant to imitate. The structure of these - initially random - patterns is tracked down to later experimental ‘generations’. Frequentist statistics show how participants’ biases are amplified by cultural transmission, making drumming patterns more structured. Structure is achieved faster than in transmission within, rather than between, participants. A Bayesian model approximates the motif structures participants learned and created. Overall, our data and model show that individual biases for musicality play a central role in shaping cultural transmission of musical rhythm.",1468,159,643,23.0

However, cooperation is not always observable by potential partners before mate choice. To address whether cooperative phenotypes are preferred based on cues different from cooperative behaviors per se, we designed an experimental paradigm using wild-born mound-building mice (Mus spicilegus), a species with biparental care. In this species, females cannot observe male cooperative behaviors: mate choice occurs in the spring, whereas mounds are cooperatively built in the fall. We first assessed the variation in mound building investment and identified males exhibiting high and low amounts of cooperation. Second, we presented these males to females during two-way choice tests. As offspring survival relies on mound protection, we hypothesized that mound building could be a form of paternal care and assessed whether cooperative males were more involved in offspring attendance using pup-retrieval experiments. Our results indicate that females were more attracted to highly cooperative males over less cooperative, even when they did not observe them build. This finding suggests that female mate choice is influenced either by cues of cooperativeness different than cooperative behaviors or by preferences for traits associated with cooperativeness. Moreover, male offspring attendance was negatively correlated with cooperativeness, suggesting the potential existence of two alternative paternal strategies in offspring care (mound building versus offspring attendance). Overall, our findings support the existence of preference for cooperative phenotypes in a non-human species and suggest that sexual selection might be involved in the evolution of cooperation.",1237,145,311,20.0

In parallel, there has been an unprecedented and rapid improvement in our ability to track animals and their behaviour in the wild. However, while the spatial analysis of tracking data is widespread, its temporal aspect is largely unexplored. Here, we review the tools that are available or have potential to record rhythms in the wild animals with emphasis on currently overlooked approaches and monitoring systems. We then demonstrate, in three question-driven case studies, how the integration of traditional and newer approaches can help answer novel chronobiological questions in free-living animals. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues in field chronobiology that may benefit from technological development in the future.

We validated this microfluidic paradigm by corroborating previous studies in showing that virgin C. remanei and C. elegans males have a strong preference for virgin females over mated ones.

Ants can accomplish complex tasks as a group whereas individual ants are not intelligent (in the context of thisstudy’s tasks). In this study, group transportation and obstacle navigation in Formica japonica, an ant species exhibiting ‘uncoordinated transportation’ (primitive group transportation), are observed using two differently conditioned colonies. Analysesfocus on the effect of group size on two key quantities: transportation speed and obstacle navigation period. Additionally, this study examines how these relationships differ between colonies. The tendencies in transportation speed differ between colonies whereas the obstacle navigation period is consistently reduced irrespective of the colony. To explain this seemingly inconsistent result in transportation speed, we focus on behavioral diversity in ‘directivity’, defined as the tendency of individual ants totransport a food item toward their own preferential direction. Directivity is not always toward the nest, but rather is distributed around it. The diversity of the first colony is less than that of the second colony. Based on the above results, a mechanical model is constructed. Using the translational and rotational motion equations of a rigid rod, the model mimics a food item being pulled by single or multiple ants. The directions of pulling forces exerted by individual ants are assumed to be distributed around the direction pointing toward the nest. The simulation results suggest that, as diversity in directivity increases, so does the success rate in more complicated obstacle navigation. In contrast, depending on group size, the speed of group transportation increases in the case of lower diversity while it is almost constant in the case of higher diversity. Transportation speed and obstacle navigation success rate are in a trade-off relationship.",990,182,246,25.0

Cumulative culture is often explained by appeal to a combination of high-fidelity social learning and innovation, the “ratchet effect.” What is often overlooked is that both human and other animal culture is supported by a more primary ratchet effect that retains and increases the prevalence of adaptive behavior. This primary ratchet can arise without appeal to specialized cognitive adaptations and is plausibly more widespread in animal societies. We use a simple model to highlight how simple forms of contingent social learning can create the primary ratchet effect, dramatically increasing the prevalence of adaptive, hard to invent behavior. We investigate some ways that demography may interact with the primary ratchet to generate patterns of cultural variation.

Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of one-way (including counterclockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the white (w+) locus promoted persistent oneway walking by increasing the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of w+ was further supported by the observations that (1) w+ duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of w+ in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes.

Lee, Mehdi Keramati",107078;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/107078,"Decision-making in the real world presents the challenge of requiring flexible yet prompt behavior, a balance that has been characterized in terms of a trade-off between a slower, prospective goal-directed model-based (MB) strategy and a fast, retrospective habitual model-free (MF) strategy. Theory predicts that flexibility to changes in both reward values and transition contingencies can determine the relative influence of the two systems in reinforcement learning, but few studies have manipulated the latter. Therefore, we developed a novel two-level contingency change task in which transition contingencies between states change every few trials; MB and MF control predict different responses following these contingency changes, allowing their relative influence to be inferred. Additionally, we manipulated the rate of contingency changes in order to determine whether contingency change volatility would play a role in shifting subjects between a MB and MF strategy. We found that human subjects employed a hybrid MB/MF strategy on the task, corroborating the parallel contribution of MB and MF systems in reinforcement learning. Further, subjects did not remain at one level of MB/MF behavior but rather displayed a shift towards more MB behavior over the first two blocks that was not attributable to the rate of contingency changes but rather to the extent of training. We demonstrate that flexibility to contingency changes can distinguish MB and MF strategies, with human subjects utilizing a hybrid strategy that shifts towards more MB behavior over blocks, consequently corresponding to a higher payoff.Author Summary To make good decisions, we must learn to associate actions with their true outcomes. Flexibility to changes in action/outcome relationships, therefore, is essential for optimal decision-making. For example, actions can lead to outcomes that change in value – one day, your favorite food is poorly made and thus less pleasant. Alternatively, changes can occur in terms of contingencies – ordering a dish of one kind and instead receiving another. How we respond to such changes is indicative of our decision-making strategy; habitual learners will continue to choose their favorite food even if the quality has gone down, whereas goal-directed learners will soon learn it is better to choose another dish. A popular paradigm probes the effect of value changes on decision making, but the effect of contingency changes is still unexplored. Therefore, we developed a novel task to study the latter. We find that humans used a mixed habitual/goal-directed strategy in which they became more goal-directed over the course of the task, and also earned more rewards with increasing goal-directed behavior. This shows that flexibility to contingency changes is adaptive for learning from rewards, and indicates that flexibility to contingency changes can reveal which decision-making strategy is used.",1941,147,645,35.0

Goffe, Julia Fischer, Holger Sennhenn-Reulen",160671;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/160671,"The construction of rank hierarchies based on agonistic interactions between two individuals (“dyads”) is an important component in the characterization of the social structure of groups. To this end, winner-loser matrices are typically created, which collapse the outcome of dyadic interactions over time, resulting in the loss of all information contained in the temporal domain. Methods that track changes in the outcome of dyadic interactions (such as “Elo-scores”) are receiving increasing interest. Critically, individual scores are not just based on the succession of wins and losses, but depend on the values of starting scores and an update (“tax”) coefficient. Recent studies improved existing methods by introducing a point estimation of these auxiliary parameters on the basis of a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. For a sound assessment of the rank hierarchies generated this way, we argue that measures of uncertainty of the estimates, as well as a quantification of the robustness of the methods, are also needed.We introduce a Bayesian inference (BI) approach using ‘‘partial pooling”, which rests on the assumption that all starting scores are samples from the same distribution. We compare the outcome of the ML approach to that of the BI approach using real-world data. In addition, we simulate different scenarios to explore in which way the Elo-score responds to social events (such as rank changes), and low numbers of observations.Estimates of the starting scores based on ‘partial pooling” are more robust than those based on ML, also in scenarios where some individuals have only few observations. Our simulations show that assumed rank differences may fall well within the ‘uncertain” range, and that low sampling density, unbalanced designs, and coalitionary leaps involving several individuals within the hierarchy may yield unreliable results.Our results support the view that Elo rating can be a powerful tool in the analysis of social behaviour, when the data meet certain criteria. Assessing the uncertainty greatly aids in the interpretation of results. We advocate running simulation approaches to test how well Elo scores reflect the (simulated) true structure and how sensitive the score is to true changes in the hierarchy.",1233,238,536,41.0

The desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, is an important agricultural pest. However, knowledge of locust courtship and precopulatory behavior is surprisingly limited. Here we provide a comprehensive study of the precopulatory behavior of both sexes of the desert locust in the gregarious phase, with particular emphasis on the conflict between the sexes. Detailed HD-video monitoring of courtship and mating of 20 locust pairs, in a controlled environment, enabled both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the behavior. A comprehensive list of behavioral elements was used to generate an eight-step ethogram, depicting from first encounter between the sexes to actual copulation. Further analyses included the probability of each element occurring, and a kinematic diagram based on a transitional matrix. Eleven novel behavioral elements are described in this study, and two potential points of conflict between the sexes are identified. Locust sexual interaction was characterized by the dominance of the males during the pre-mounting stage, and an overall stereotypic male courtship behavior. In contrast, females displayed no clear courtship-related behavior and an overall less organized behavioral sequence. Central elements in the sexual behavior of the females were low-amplitude hind-leg vibration, as well as rejecting males by jumping and kicking.

Although there is no consensus as to its precise function, evidence from both human and animal studies clearly points to a role in spatial cognition. However, the spatial processing impairments that follow RSC damage are not straightforward to characterise, leading to difficulties in defining the exact nature of its role. In the present article we review this literature and classify the types of ideas that have been put forward into three broad, somewhat overlapping classes: (i) Learning of landmark location, stability and permanence; (ii) Integration between spatial reference frames, and (iii) Consolidation and retrieval of spatial knowledge (“schemas”). We evaluate these models and suggest ways to test them, before briefly discussing whether the spatial function may be a subset of a more general function in episodic memory.",2162,454,2070,33.0

Similar to host-pathogen interactions, cancer negatively affects host fitness, which should lead to the selection of host control mechanisms, including behavioral traits that best minimize the proliferation of malignant cells. Social behavior is one such trait, which is suggested to influence cancer progression. While the ecological benefits of sociality in gregarious species are widely acknowledged, only limited data are available on the role of the social environment on cancer progression. Here, we exposed adult Drosophila, with colorectal-like tumors, to different social environments. First, we show that cancerous flies kept in complete isolation exhibit increased tumor progression. Yet, more surprisingly, we find that cancerous flies, kept in groups with other non-cancerous individuals, also develop tumors at a faster rate compared to those kept with other cancerous conspecifics, suggesting a strong impact of social group composition on cancer growth. Finally, we show that flies can discriminate between individuals at different stages of tumor growth and selectively choose their social environment accordingly. Control flies actively avoid flies with cancer but only at the later stages of tumor development, whereas cancerous flies display strong social interactions with cancerous flies in the early stages of tumor growth. Our study demonstrates the reciprocal links between cancer and social interactions, as well as highlighting how sociality impacts health and fitness in animals and its potential implications for disease ecology and ecosystem dynamics.",2334,210,710,31.0

Importantly, by varying the magnitude and valence (gains or losses) of monetary incentives, we orthogonalized their motivational and affective components. Corroborating theories of rational decision-making and motivation, our results first reveal that the motivational value of incentives improves aspects of confidence accuracy. However, in line with a value-confidence interaction hypothesis we further show that the affective value of incentives concurrently biases confidence reports, thus degrading confidence accuracy.

Mahadevan",188953;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/188953,"Honeybee Apis mellifera swarms form clusters made solely of bees attached to each other, forming pendant structures on tree branches (1). These clusters can be hundreds of times the size of a single organism. How these structures are stably maintained under the influence of static gravity and dynamic stimuli (e.g. wind) is unknown. To address this, we created pendant conical clusters attached to a board that was shaken with varying amplitude, frequency and total duration. Our observations show that horizontally shaken clusters spread out to form wider, flatter cones, i.e. the cluster adapts to the dynamic loading conditions, but in a reversible manner - when the loading is removed, the cluster recovers its original shape, slowly. Measuring the response of a cluster to a sharp pendular excitation before and after it adapted shows that the flattened cones deform less and relax faster than the elongated ones, i.e. they are more stable mechanically. We use particle-based simulations of a passive assemblage to suggest a behavioral hypothesis that individual bees respond to local variations in strain. This behavioral response improves the collective stability of the cluster as a whole at the expense of increasing the average mechanical burden experienced by the individual. Simulations using this rule explain our observations of adaptation to horizontal shaking. The simulations also suggest that vertical shaking will not lead to significant differential strains and thus no adaptation. To test this, we shake the cluster vertically and find that indeed there is no response to this stimulus. Altogether, our results show how an active, functional super–organism structure can respond adaptively to dynamic mechanical loading by changing its morphology to achieve better load sharing.",2520,186,1332,11.0

Hoffman",110494;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/110494,"Chemical cues are arguably the most fundamental means of animal communication and play an important role in mate choice and kin recognition. Consequently, gas chromatography (GC) in combination with either mass spectrometry (MS) or flame ionisation detection (FID) are commonly used to characterise complex chemical samples. Both GC-FID and GC-MS generate chromatograms comprising peaks that are separated according to their retention times and which represent different substances. Across chromatograms of different samples, homologous substances are expected to elute at similar retention times. However, random and often unavoidable experimental variation introduces noise, making the alignment of homologous peaks challenging, particularly with GC-FID data where mass spectral data are lacking. Here we present GCalignR, a user-friendly R package for aligning GC-FID data based on retention times. The package also implements dynamic visualisations to facilitate inspection and fine-tuning of the resulting alignments, and can be integrated within a broader workflow in R to facilitate downstream multivariate analyses. We demonstrate an example workflow using empirical data from Antarctic fur seals and explore the impact of user-defined parameter values by calculating alignment error rates for multiple datasets. The resulting alignments had low error rates for most of the explored parameter space and we could also show that GCalignR performed equally well or better than other available software. We hope that GCalignR will help to simplify the processing of chemical datasets and improve the standardization and reproducibility of chemical analyses in studies of animal chemical communication and related fields.",2448,242,1538,23.0

We tested whether fish might also show enhanced inhibitory control by subjecting guppies, Poecilia reticulata, to the motor task used to test warm-blooded vertebrates. Guppies were trained to enter a horizontal opaque cylinder to reach a food reward; then, the cylinder was replaced by a transparent one, and subjects needed to inhibit the response to pass thought the transparency to reach the food. Guppies performed correctly in 58 % of trials, a performance fully comparable to that observed in most birds and mammals. In experiment 2, we tested guppies in a task with a different type of reward, a group of conspecifics. Guppies rapidly learned to detour a transparent barrier to reach the social reward with a performance close to that of experiment 1. Our study suggests that efficient inhibitory control is shown also by fish, and its variation between-species is only partially explained by variation in brain size.",1112,102,207,27.0

Elastase-2 knockout mice (ELA2KO) exhibit alterations in the arterial blood pressure and heart rate. However, there is no data on the behavioral consequences of ELA2 deletion. In this study we addressed this question, submitting ELA2KO and wild-type (WT) mice to several models sensitive to anxiety‐ and depression-like, memory, and repetitive behaviors. Our data indicates a higher incidence of barbering behavior in ELA2KO compared to WT, as well as an anxiogenic phenotype, evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM). While a decrease in locomotor activity was observed in ELA2KO in EPM, this feature was not the main source of variation in the other parameters analyzed. The marble burying test (MBT) indicated increase in repetitive behavior, observed by a higher number of buried marbles. The actimeter test indicated a decrease in total activity and confirmed the increase in repetitive behavior. The spatial memory was tested by repeated exposure to the actimeter in a 24h interval. Both ELA2KO and WT exhibited decreased activity compared to the first exposure, without any distinction between the genotypes. However, when submitted to the cued fear conditioning, ELA2KO displayed lower levels of freezing behavior in the extinction session when compared to WT, but no difference was observed during the conditioning phase. Increased levels of BDNF were found in the prefrontal cortex but not in the hippocampus of ELA2KO mice compared to WT. Finally, in silico analysis indicates that ELA2 is putatively able to cleave BDNF, and incubation of the purified enzyme with BDNF led to the degradation of the later.

Sun, Mark D’Esposito",187666;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/187666,"Recent experiments have shown that visual cognition blends current visual input with that from the recent past to guide ongoing decision making. This serial dependence is tuned to the similarity between consecutive stimuli and appears to exploit the temporal autocorrelation normally present in visual scenes to promote perceptual stability. While these benefits have been assumed, evidence that serial dependence directly alters stimulus perception has been limited. In the present study, we parametrically vary the delay between stimulus and response in a spatial delayed response task to explore the trajectory of serial dependence from the moment of perception into post-perceptual visual working memory. We find that behavioral responses made immediately after viewing a stimulus show evidence of adaptation, but not attractive serial dependence. Only as the memory period lengthens is a blending of past and present information apparent in behavior, reaching its maximum with a memory delay of six seconds. These results dovetail with other recent findings to bolster the interpretation that serial dependence is a phenomenon of mnemonic rather than perceptual processes. We also demonstrate that when leading mathematical models of visual working memory are adjusted to account for this trial-history effect, their fit to behavioral data is substantially improved.",1491,132,468,22.0

Rutten, Bart Kempenaers",117036;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/117036,"Biparental care for offspring requires cooperation, but it is also a potential source of conflict, since one parent may care less at the expense of the other. How, then, do parents respond to the reduction of their partner’s care? Theoretical models predict that parents that feed offspring should partially compensate for the reduced care of their partner. However, for incubating birds partial compensation is unlikely the optimal strategy, because the entire brood can fail with reduced care. Although biparental incubation dominates in non-passerine birds, short-term manipulations of parental care and evaluations of individual differences in the response, both crucial to our understanding of parental cooperation, are scarce. Here, we describe the response of semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) parents to a 24-hour removal of their partner during the incubation period, explore factors that can explain individual variation in the response, and describe how incubation rhythms changed after the removed parent returned. On average, the parents compensated partially for the absence of their partner’s care (59%; 95%CI: 49-70%, N = 25 individuals). The level of compensation did not differ between the sexes. However, individual responses varied from no to full compensation (2-101%). In seven nests where the removed parent never returned, the widowed parent attended the nest for 0-10 days (median: 4 days). In contrast to patterns observed in undisturbed nests or in uniparental species, nest attendance during compensation tended to be higher during the warmer part of the day. Although the level of compensation was not related to the before-experimental share of incubation, more responsive parents (that left the nest earlier upon human approach) compensated more. The quality of incubation in the after-experimental period was lower than usual, but improved quickly over time. Our findings suggest that full compensation might be limited by energetic constraints or by variation in responsiveness to the absence of the partner. Nevertheless, semipalmated sandpiper parents are able to adjust their subsequent incubation behaviour to take full responsibility for the nest when widowed. Because (nearly) full compensation was the most common response, we speculate that all individuals attempt full compensation, but that some fail because their energy stores get depleted, or because they are less responsive to the absence of their partner.",1368,160,358,24.0

We developed and tested a heuristic jump filter combined with median filter and extended Kalman filter. The performance of the filters were compared against reference data collected from Insentec Roughage intake feeders and scan sampling of animal presence in a specific lying stall with over 1500 reference observations from both methods.We were able to improve the quality of the positioning data significantly using filtering. The 9th order median filter provided best estimates for cow position when the cows were not moving with median 100% of measurements located in correct stall and 84% in correct feeding trough when compared to the reference observations and measurements. The extended Kalman filter also improved the positioning accuracy significantly when compared to raw data and provides better of estimates of the trajectory of moving cows.,1197,93,948,18.0

We used visual arrays to investigate whether cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) can learn this rule and which strategies they use. After training on a subset of exemplars, half of the tested monkeys successfully generalized to novel combinations. These tamarins discriminated between categories of tokens with different properties (A, B, X) and detected a positional relationship between non-adjacent items even in the presence of novel distractors. Generalization, though, was incomplete, since we observed a failure with items that during training had always been presented in reinforced arrays. The pattern of errors revealed that successful subjects used visual similarity with training stimuli to solve the task, and that tamarins extracted the relative position of As and Bs rather than their absolute position, similarly to what observed in other species. Relative position encoding appears to be the default strategy in different tasks and taxa.",870,115,197,25.0

We use a wagering experiment to show that modeling subjects' choices allows for classifying individuals according to their prior biases, which fully explain from first principles the differences in their later confidence reports. Our parameter-free confidence model predicts two counterintuitive patterns for individuals with different prior beliefs: pessimists should report higher confidence than optimists, and, for the same task difficulty, the confidence of pessimists should increase with the generosity of the task.

Interval timing models have contributed a rich variety of time representations and provided accurate predictions for the timing of responses, but they usually have little to say about associative learning. In this article we present a unified model of conditioning and timing that is based on the influential Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model and the more recently developed Timing Drift-Diffusion model. We test the model by simulating 10 experimental phenomena and show that it can provide an adequate account for 8, and a partial account for the other 2. We argue that the model can account for more phenomena in the chosen set than these other similar in scope models: CSC-TD, MS-TD, Learning to Time and Modular Theory. A comparison and analysis of the mechanisms in these models is provided, with a focus on the types of time representation and associative learning rule used.Author Summary How does the time of events affect the way we learn about associations between these events? Computational models have made great contributions to our understanding of associative learning, but they usually do not perform very well when time is taken into account. Models of timing have reached high levels of accuracy in describing timed behaviour, but they usually do not have much to say about associations. A unified approach would involve combining associative learning and timing models into a single framework. This article takes just this approach. It combines the influential Rescorla-Wagner associative model with a timing model based on the Drift-Diffusion process, and shows how the resultant model can account for a number of learning and timing phenomena. The article also compares the new model to others that are similar in scope.",1204,188,455,65.0

How we use these disparate mechanisms to make geometric judgments remains unresolved. Here, we deploy a classically used cognitive geometric task - planar triangle completion - to study the statistics of errors in the location of the missing vertex. Our results show that the mean location has an error proportional to the side of the triangle, the standard deviation is sub-linearly dependent on the side length, and has a negative skewness. These scale-dependent responses directly contradict the conclusions of recent cognitive studies that innate Euclidean rules drive our geometric judgments. To explain our observations, we turn to a perceptual basis for geometric reasoning that balances the competing effects of local smoothness and global orientation of extrapolated trajectories. The resulting mathematical framework captures our observations and further predicts the statistics of the missing angle in a second triangle completion task. To go beyond purely perceptual geometric tasks, we carry out a categorical version of triangle completion that asks about the change in the missing angle after a change in triangle shape. The observed responses show a systematic scale-dependent discrepancy at odds with rule-based Euclidean reasoning, but one that is completely consistent with our framework. All together, our findings point to the use of statistical dynamic models of the noisy perceived physical world, rather than on the  rules of Euclid in determining how we reason geometrically.",1726,182,949,19.0

Alternatively, studies showing similarity between parent and partner4,5 support positive sexual imprinting6,7, where individuals are more likely to choose mates with the physical characteristics of their other-sex parent. This interpretation has been strongly criticized because the same pattern could also be caused by sex-linked heritable preferences3, where similarity in appearance between an individual’s partner and their other-sex parent is caused by similarity in preferences between the individual and their same-sex parent. The relationships among own, parents’ and same-sex partner’s eye color provide an elegant test of these hypotheses, which each postulate a different best predictor of partner’s eye color. While the matching hypothesis predicts this will be own eye color, the sex-linked heritable preference hypothesis predicts this will be the other-sex parent’s eye color and the positive sexual imprinting hypothesis predicts this will be the partner-sex parent’s eye color.

Sane",179861;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/179861,"Flying insects routinely forage in complex and cluttered sensory environments. Their search for a food or a pheromone source typically begins with a whiff of odor, which triggers a flight response, eventually bringing the insect in the vicinity of the odor source. The precise localization of an odor source, however, requires the use of both visual and olfactory modalities, aided by air currents that trap odor molecules into turbulent plumes, which the insects track. Here, we investigated odor tracking behavior in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) presented with low- or high-contrast visual landmarks, which were either paired with or separate from an attractive odor cue. These experiments were conducted either in a gentle air stream which generated odor plumes, or in still air in which odor dissipates uniformly in all directions. The trajectories of the flies revealed several novel features of their odor-tracking behavior in addition to those that have been previously documented (e.g. cast- and-surge maneuvers). First, in both moving and still air, odor-seeking flies rely on the co-occurrence of visual landmarks with olfactory cues to guide them to putative odorant objects in the decisive phase before landing. Second, flies abruptly decelerate when they encounter an odor plume, and thereafter steer towards nearby visual objects that had no inherent salience in the absence of odor. This indicates that the interception of an attractive odor increases their salience to nearby high-contrast visual landmarks. Third, flies adopt distinct odor tracking strategies during flight in moving vs. still air. Whereas they weave in and out of plumes towards an odor source when airflow is present, their approach is more gradual and incremental in still air. Both strategies are robust and flexible, and can ensure that the flies reliably find the odor source under diverse visual and airflow environments. Our experiments also indicate the possibility of an olfactory “ working memory” that enables flies to continue their search even when the olfactory feedback is reduced or absent. Together, these results provide insights into how flies determine the precise location of an odor source.",1200,205,645,48.0

For most honeybees, waggle dance follow preceded the appearance of the first waggle dance from 1 week after the imaginal molt. The duration per trip increased just after waggle dance follow. Before the appearance of the first waggle dance, the honeybee repeatedly follows waggle dances that indicate a limited number (2–6) of food source locations. We discriminated between two types of foragers with different roles, recruits and novice scouts, by comparing the vectors indicated by the bees’ first waggle dance (sending vectors) with dances they had previously followed (received vectors). Of 14 tagged honeybees, 11 were categorized as recruits and 2 as novice scouts. For recruits (but not for novice scouts), the duration per trip increased significantly after waggle dances follow and substantially increased just before the appearance of the first waggle dance. Moreover, recruits increased the number of times they followed waggle dances indicating the same location, and their first waggle dance indicated this location. These results suggest that the differentiation of these two types of foragers is partly related to behavioral differences after waggle dance follows: whether trip is activated or not by follows a waggle dance.Summary statement Because of technological difficulties, there are no studies comparing the development of recruit and scout waggle dances. Using miniature radio frequency identification tags, we observed and clarified these developmental processes.ANantennaRFIDradio frequency identification.",1046,154,696,40.0

Lobecke, Roland Kern, Martin Egelhaaf",178988;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/178988,"For central place foragers, such as bumblebees, it is essential to return reliably to their nest. Instead of just flying away to forage, bumblebees, leaving their inconspicuous nest hole for the first time, need to gather and learn sufficient information about the surroundings to allow them to return to the nest at the end of their trip. Therefore, we assume an intrinsic learning program that manifests itself in the flight structure immediately after leaving the nest for the first time.In this study, we recorded and analysed the first outbound flight of individually marked naïve bumblebees in an indoor environment. We found characteristic loop-like features in the flight pattern that appear to be necessary for the bees to acquire environmental information and might be relevant for finding the nest hole after a foraging trip.Despite common features in their spatio-temporal organisation, the first departure flights from the nest are characterised by a high level of variability in their loop-like flight structure across animals. Changes in turn direction of body orientation, for example, are distributed evenly across the entire area used for the flights without any systematic relation to the nest location. By considering the common flight motifs as well as this variability, we came to the hypothesis, that a kind of dynamic snapshot is taken during the early phase of departure flights in the close vicinity of the nest location. The quality of this snapshot is hypothesised to be ‘ tested’ during the later phases of the departure flights concerning its usefulness for local homing.",729,102,224,35.0

We compared the swimming kinematics among a diverse array of medusae, varying in taxonomy, morphology and propulsive and foraging modes, in order to evaluate the prevalence of PER in medusae. We found that while PER is commonly observed among taxa, the magnitude of the contribution to overall swimming varied greatly. The ability of medusae to utilize PER was not related to morphology and swimming performance but was controlled by their swimming kinematics. Utilizing PER required the medusae to pause after bell expansion and individuals could modulate their PER by changing their pause duration. Passive energy recapture can greatly enhance swimming efficiency but there appear to be trade-offs associated with utilizing PER.",669,122,263,13.0

We observed specific deficits for spatial memory, impaired long-term memory for visual objects, acquisition and reversal of motor responses, reduced motor dexterity, and impaired adaptive function as measured by nesting and anxiety tasks. The Ts65Dn mice showed intact temporal ordering, novelty detection, and visual object recognition with short delays. These results phenocopy the performance of participants with Down syndrome on the Arizona Cognitive Task Battery. This approach extends the utility of mouse models of Down syndrome by integrating the expertise of clinical neurology and cognitive neuroscience into the mouse behavioral laboratory.

Soon after DEET was developed, almost 6 decades ago, it was reported that it reduced mosquito feeding on blood mixed with this repellent. It is now known that the mosquito proboscis senses contact repellents with the tips (labella) of the labium, which remain in direct contact with the outer layers of the skin, while the stylets, including the feeding deterrent sensor (labrum), penetrate the skin. We designed a behavioral assay that allowed us to tease apart contact repellency from feeding deterrence. First, we demonstrate here that when DEET was mixed with blood and covered by Parafilm® layers, it did not leak to the outer surface. In our assays, the mean number of landings and duration of contacts with surfaces covering blood mixed with DEET or blood plus solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) did not differ significantly. The feeding times, however, were significantly different. When blood was mixed either with 0.1 or 1% DEET, female southern house mosquitoes spent significantly less time feeding than the time spent feeding on blood mixed only with the solvent. By contrast, there were no significant differences in the mean times of feeding on blood containing 1% picaridin and blood plus solvent. Like DEET, the contact repellent and insecticide, permethrin, caused a significant reduction in feeding time. We, therefore, concluded, that in this context, DEET and permethrin act as feeding deterrents.",960,79,239,14.0

To reinitiate investigation of this phenomenon, we performed automated segmentation of songs, but failed to detect the proposed periodicity [Arthur BJ et al.

Kyriacou et al. manually annotated a subset of our recordings and reported that two strains displayed rhythms with genotype-specific periodicity, in agreement with their original reports. We cannot replicate this finding and show that the manually-annotated data, the original automatically segmented data, and a new data set provide no evidence for either the existence of song rhythms or song periodicity differences between genotypes. Furthermore, we have re-examined our methods and analysis and find that our automated segmentation method was not biased to prevent detection of putative song periodicity.

We found that laboratory and isogenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae showed consistent individual behaviors when swimming freely in identical wells or in reaction to stimuli. We also found that this behavioral inter-individual variability was reduced when we impaired the histone deacetylation pathway. Individuals with high levels of histone H4 acetylation, and specifically H4K12, behaved similar to the average of the population, but those with low levels deviated from it. More precisely, we found a set of genomic regions whose histone H4 acetylation is reduced with the distance between the individual and the average population behavior. We found evidence that this modulation depends on a complex of Yin-yang 1 (YY1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that binds to and deacetylates these regions. These changes were not only maintained at the transcriptional level but also amplified, as most target regions were located near genes encoding transcription factors. We suggest that stochasticity in the histone deacetylation pathway participates the generation of genetic-independent behavioral inter-individual variability.",2233,151,518,61.0

Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity (i.e. individual differences in behavioural change) and predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intra-individual variation). We analysed data on 3,263 dogs’ interactions (N = 19,281) with unfamiliar people during their first month after arrival at the shelter. Accounting for personality, plasticity (linear and quadratic trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were observed. Behavioural repeatability was higher one week after arrival compared to arrival day.

Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e. uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4 - 10 months, 10 months - 3 years, 3 - 6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness.Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate ‘aggressive personality’ trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.",2243,230,784,57.0

Honey bees further evolved a symbolic communication to direct nest mates to attractive food sources. Till now it is unclear how these capabilities evolved. Sixty years ago, Vincent Dethier demonstrated that a small-scale sugar-elicited search behavior identified in flies shows remarkable similarities with honey bee dance behavior. Those findings suggested that both behaviors are based on common mechanisms and are likely evolutionary related. We now present for the first time a detailed comparison of the sugar-elicited search behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. In both species, intake of sugar elicits a complex of searching responses. The most obvious response was an increase in turning frequency, but more importantly we found that flies and honey bees returned to the location of the sugar drop. They even returned to the food location when we prevented them from using visual and chemosensory cues indicating that this small scale local search involves path integration mechanisms. Finally, we show that visual landmarks presented in the vicinity of the sugar drop affected the search trajectory and in honey bees the sugar intake induced learning of landmarks. Together, our experiments indicate that the sugar-elicited local search exhibits two major behavioral capabilities of large-scale navigation, path integration and landmark orientation.Significance Statement To search for food social insects evolved sophisticated strategies of spatial orientation and large-scale navigation. We now show that even a small-scale local search behavior in solitary flies and social honey bees involves path integration and landmark learning two major mechanisms of large-scale navigation.

At the beginning, the end, and back at the beginning of each route, participants pointed to well-known landmarks in the surrounding city and campus (external landmarks), and newly-learned landmarks in the hospital (internal landmarks). We found improved performance with the compass only for external landmarks, driven by people’s use of the availability of north to orient these judgments. No such improved orientation occurred for the internal landmarks. These findings reveal the utility of vibrotactile compasses for learning new indoor spaces.

Selection for infection avoidance behaviours may therefore be developmentally uncoupled. Using a combination of experimental infections and behavioural choice assays, here we tested if Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies avoid potentially infectious environments at distinct developmental stages. When given conspecific fly carcasses as a food source, larval-stage flies did not discriminate between carcasses that were clean or infected with the pathogenic Drosophila C Virus (DCV), even though scavenging was a viable route of DCV transmission. Adult females however, discriminated between different oviposition sites, laying more eggs near a clean rather than an infectious carcass if they were healthy; DCV-infected females did not discriminate between the two environments. While potentially risky, laying eggs near potentially infectious carcasses was always preferred to sites containing only fly medium. Our findings suggest that infection avoidance can play an important role in how mothers provision their offspring, and underline the need to consider infection avoidance behaviours at multiple life-stages.",964,156,361,26.0

These experiments, together with one experiment conducted with 12-month-old infants, yielded three main findings. First, infants expect that characters who engaged in imitation will approach and affiliate with the characters whom they imitated. Second, infants show no evidence of expecting that characters who were targets of imitation will approach and affiliate with their imitators. Third, analyzing imitative interactions is difficult for young infants, whose expectations vary in strength depending on the number of characters to be tracked and the number of affiliative actors to be compared.

However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains the observed dynamics of learning. Further, the theory makes surprising predictions about the dynamics of the shape of the pitch distribution, which we confirm experimentally.",1348,184,432,9.0

Brainard",166124;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/166124,"Studies of learning mechanisms critically depend on the ability to accurately assess learning outcomes. This assessment can be impeded by the often complex, multidimensional nature of behavior. We present a novel, automated approach to evaluating imitative learning that is founded in information theory. Conceptually, our approach estimates the amount of information present in a reference behavior that is absent from the learned behavior. We validate our approach through examination of songbird vocalizations, complex learned behaviors the study of which has provided many insights into sensory-motor learning in general and vocal learning in particular. Historically, learning has been holistically assessed by human inspection or through comparison of specific song features selected by experimenters (e.g. fundamental frequency, spectral entropy). In contrast, our approach relies on statistical models that broadly capture the structure of each song, and then uses these models to estimate the amount of information in the reference song but absent from the learned song. We show that our information theoretic measure of song learning (contrast entropy) is well correlated with human evaluation of song learning. We then expand the analysis beyond song learning and show that contrast entropy also detects the typical song deterioration that occurs following deafening. More broadly, this approach potentially provides a framework for assessing learning across a broad range of similarly structured behaviors.Author Summary Measuring learning outcomes is a critical objective of research into the neural, molecular, and behavioral mechanisms that support learning. Demonstration that a given manipulation results in better or worse learning outcomes requires an accurate and consistent measurement of learning quality. However, many behaviors (e.g. speech, walking, and reading) are complex and multidimensional, confounding the assessment of learning. One behavior subject to such confounds, vocal learning in Estrildid finches, has emerged as a vital model for sensory motor learning broadly and human speech learning in particular. Here, we demonstrate a new approach, founded in information theory, to the assessment of learning for complex high dimensional behaviors. Conceptually, we determine the amount of information (across many dimensions) present in a reference behavior and then assess how much of that information is present in the resultant learned behavior. We show that this measure provides an accurate, holistic, and automated assessment of vocal learning in Estrildid finches. Potentially, this same approach could be deployed to assess shared content in any multidimensional data, behavioral or otherwise.",1084,186,437,35.0

Pitch discrimination performance is usually measured using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) procedures in humans and go/no-go tasks in animals, potentially confounding human-to-animal comparisons. We have previously shown that pitch discrimination thresholds of ferrets on a 2AFC task are markedly poorer than those reported for go/no-go tasks in other non-human species (Walker et al., 2009). To better compare the pitch discrimination performance of ferret with other species, here we measure pitch change detection thresholds of ferrets and humans on a common, appetitive go/no-go task design. We found that ferrets’ pitch thresholds were ~10 times larger than that of humans on the go/no-go task, and were within the range of thresholds reported in other non-human species. Interestingly, ferrets’ thresholds were 100 times larger than human thresholds on a 2AFC pitch discrimination task using the same stimuli. These results emphasize that sensory discrimination thresholds can differ across tasks, particularly for non-human animals. Performance on our go/no-go task is likely to reflect different neurobiological processes than that on our 2AFC task, as the former required the subjects only to detect a pitch change while the latter required them to label the direction of the pitch change.ABBREVIATIONS ",782,281,401,41.0

To rectify these limitations, we developed a VR system (ratCAVE) that provides realistic and low-latency visual feedback directly to head movements of completely unrestrained rodents. Immersed in this VR system, rats displayed naturalistic behavior by spontaneously interacting with and hugging virtual walls, exploring virtual objects, and avoiding virtual cliffs.

While there is general support for this relationship across species, within-population evidence is still contentious. Among the main reasons behind such problem is the confusion discerning between-from within-individual patterns. Here, we tested this hypothesis empirically by investigating the parental care of male dunnocks (Prunella modularis) in relation to paternity. We used a thorough dataset of observations in a wild population, genetic parentage, and a within-subject centring statistical approach to disentangle paternal care adjustment within-male and between males. We found support for the certainty of paternity hypothesis, as there was evidence for within-male adjustment in paternal care when socially monogamous males lost paternity to extra-pair sires. There was little evidence of a between-male effect overall. Our findings show that monogamous males adjust paternal care when paired to the same female partner. We also show that – in monogamous broods – the proportion of provisioning visits made by males yields fitness benefits in terms of fledging success. Our results suggest that socially monogamous females that engage in extra-pair behaviour may suffer fitness costs, as their partners’ reduction in paternal care can negatively affect fledging success.",1015,218,372,23.0

Birdsong shares with music the goal to attract and hold its listeners’ attention and might make use of similar strategies to achieve this goal. We here tested a songbird’s rhythm, as represented by the amplitude envelope (containing information on note timing, duration, and intensity), for expressiveness. We used multifractal analysis which is designed to detect in a signal dynamic fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable states on multiple timescales (e.g. notes, subphrases, songs). Results show that the songs' amplitude envelope is strongly multifractal, indicating rhythm is patterned by fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable patterns. Moreover, comparing original songs with re-synthesized songs that lack all subtle deviations from the “standard” note envelopes, we find that deviations in note intensity and duration significantly contribute to the rhythm’s multifractality. This suggests that birds render their songs more expressive by subtly modifying note timing patterns, similar to musical operations like accelerando or ritardando. Our findings bear consequences for neuronal models of vocal sequence generation in birds, as they require non-local rules to generate rhythm.",1600,189,698,16.0

Prior work suggests that humans compute TTC using kinematic information such as distance and speed without explicitly relying on temporal cues, just as one would do in a physics classroom using kinematic equations. Considering the inherent uncertainty associated with estimates of speed and distance and the ability of human brain to combine different sources of information, we asked whether humans additionally rely on temporal cues. We found that humans actively integrate speed information with both explicit and implicit timing cues. Analysis of behavior in relation to a Bayesian model revealed that the additional temporal information helps subjects optimize their performance in the presence of measurement uncertainty.

Behaviorally, we found the occurrence of task unrelated thought (TUT) in easy situations was associated with thinking in words. Using experience sampling data, in combination with online measures of neural function, we established that activity in a region of anterior cingulate cortex / medial-prefrontal cortex (mPFC) tracked with changes in the expression of TUT. This region is at the intersection of two mPFC clusters identified through their association with variation in aspects of spontaneous thought: thinking in words (dorsal) and mental time travel (ventral). Finally, using meta-analytic decoding we confirmed the dorsal/ventral distinction within mPFC corresponding to a functional difference between domains linked to language and meaning and those linked to memory and scene construction. This evidence suggests a role for mPFC in the expression of TUT that may emerge from interactions with distributed neural signals reflecting processes such as language and memory.",897,222,468,40.0

When located in a novel environment together with the familiar conspecific, tortoises reached the average distance expected by random trajectories. On the contrary, tortoises tested with an unfamiliar conspecific first explored the mate, then actively kept a distance significantly larger than expected by chance.

In Experiment 2 we compared OT and AVP concentrations between pet dogs and a population of assistance dogs that have been bred for affiliative and non-aggressive temperaments, and investigated neuroendocrine predictors of individual differences in social behavior within the assistance dog population. Compared to pet dogs, assistance dogs had higher free and total OT, but there were no differences in either measure for AVP.

Previous studies from our laboratory validated salivary measures of OT and AVP in dogs, however, it is currently unknown whether these measures respond dynamically to aspects of HAI.

We employed a between-subjects design with a group of Labrador retrievers and Labrador retriever X golden retriever crosses (23 females, 15 males). Half of the dogs engaged in 10 minutes of free-form friendly interaction with a human experimenter (HAI condition), and the other half rested quietly in the same environment, without human interaction (control condition).

In this novel paradigm, participants repeatedly choose between multiple options in order to maximise their rewards. The options are described by a number of contextual features which are predictive of the rewards through initially unknown functions. From their experience with choosing options and observing the consequences of their decisions, participants can learn about the functional relation between contexts and rewards and improve their decision strategy over time. In three experiments, we explore participants’ behaviour in such learning environments. We predict participants’ behaviour by context-blind (mean-tracking, Kalman filter) and contextual (Gaussian process and linear regression) learning approaches combined with different choice strategies. Participants are mostly able to learn about the context-reward functions and their behaviour is best described by a Gaussian process learning strategy which generalizes previous experience to similar instances. In a relatively simple task with binary features, they seem to combine this learning with a “probability of improvement” decision strategy which focuses on alternatives that are expected to lead to an improvement upon a current favourite option. In a task with continuous features that are linearly related to the rewards, participants seem to more explicitly balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, in a difficult learning environment where the relation between features and rewards is non-linear, some participants are again well-described by a Gaussian process learning strategy, whereas others revert to context-blind strategies.",1727,270,1746,21.0

Hoekstra",150243;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/150243,"SummaryA central challenge in biology is to understand how innate behaviors evolve between closely related species. One way to elucidate how differences arise is to compare the development of behavior in species with distinct adult traits. Here, we report that Peromyscus polionotus is strikingly precocious with regard to burrowing behavior, but not other behaviors, compared to its sister species P. maniculatus. In P. polionotus, burrows were excavated as early as 17 days of age, while P. maniculatus did not build burrows until 10 days later. Moreover, the well-known differences in burrow architecture between adults of these species—P. polionotus adults excavate long burrows with an escape tunnel, while P. maniculatus dig short, single-tunnel burrows—were intact in juvenile burrowers. To test whether this juvenile behavior is influenced by early-life environment, pups of both species were reciprocally cross-fostered. Fostering did not alter the characteristic burrowing behavior of either species, suggesting these differences are genetic. In backcross F2 hybrids, we show that precocious burrowing and adult tunnel length are genetically correlated, and that a single P. polionotus allele in a genomic region linked to adult tunnel length is predictive of precocious burrow construction. The co-inheritance of developmental and adult traits indicates the same genetic region—either a single gene with pleiotropic effects, or closely linked genes— acts on distinct aspects of the same behavior across life stages. Such genetic variants likely affect behavioral drive (i.e. motivation) to burrow, and thereby affect both the development and adult expression of burrowing behavior.Juvenile P. polionotus construct burrows precociously compared to its sister species P. maniculatusCross-fostering does not alter species-specific burrowing behaviorA QTL linked to adult tunnel length predicts developmental onset of burrow construction in hybridsPleiotropic genetic variant(s) may affect behavioral drive across life stages",1350,325,510,35.0

In this work, the morphology and mechanical properties of the scales from different body sections (leading body half, middle trunk and trailing body half) and positions (dorsal, lateral and ventral) of Boa constrictor and Eryx tataricus have been characterized and compared to investigate the corresponding effects on the tribological behaviors and to probe the possible coupling mechanism. The morphological characterizations of scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy have revealed significant differences between the two species with the roughness of scales from Boa constrictor being larger in general. The mechanical properties measured by nanoindentation have corroboratively demonstrated substantial differences in terms of elastic modulus and hardness. Meanwhile, tribological characterizations of scales in different body positions from the two species also exhibit evident anisotropy. Interestingly, the ventral scales manifest higher friction coefficients but lower surface roughness, together with relatively larger elastic modulus and hardness.

Central to this problem is the continued focus on hominid cognition as a benchmark, and the assumption that behavioral complexity has a simple relationship with brain size. Although comparative studies of brain size have been criticized for not reflecting how evolution actually operates, and for producing spurious, inconsistent results, the causes of these limitations have received little discussion. We show how these issues arise from implicit assumptions about what brain size measures and how it correlates with behavioral and cognitive traits. We explore how inconsistencies can arise through heterogeneity in evolutionary trajectories and selection pressures on neuroanatomy or neurophysiology across taxa. We examine how interference from ecological and life history variables complicates interpretations of brain-behavior correlations, and point out how this problem is exacerbated by the limitations of brain and cognitive measures. These considerations, and the diversity of brain morphologies and behavioral capacities, suggest that comparative brain-behavior research can make greater progress by focusing on specific neuroanatomical and behavioral traits within relevant ecological and evolutionary contexts. We suggest that a synergistic combination of the ‘bottom up’ approach of classical neuroethology and the ‘top down’ approach of comparative biology/psychology within closely related but behaviorally diverse clades can limit the effects of heterogeneity, interference, and noise. We argue this shift away from broad-scale analyses of superficial phenotypes will provide deeper, more robust insights into brain evolution.",3150,460,1402,92.0

This finding has taken on new importance in light of recent proposal that many forms of memory depend on a compressed representation of the past (Howard, Shankar, Aue, &amp; Criss, 2015). This paper replicates and extends the results of the classic papers. A Bayesian t-test showed substantial evidence for the null effect of lag to the less recent item on correct RT. In addition, this paper reports that correct RT is a sub-linear function of lag to the more recent probe and replicates the classic finding that error RT depends on lag to the less recent probe.

This trade-off usually determines a fixed proportion of exploitative choices (i.e. choice of the action that subjectively appears as best at a given moment) relative to exploratory choices (i.e. testing other actions that now appear worst but may turn out promising later). The problem of finding an efficient exploration-exploitation trade-off has been well studied both in the Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience fields. Rather than using a fixed proportion, non-stationary multi-armed bandit methods in the former have proven that principles such as exploring actions that have not been tested for a long time can lead to performance closer to optimal - bounded regret. In parallel, researches in the latter have investigated solutions such as progressively increasing exploitation in response to improvements of performance, transiently increasing exploration in response to drops in average performance, or attributing exploration bonuses specifically to actions associated with high uncertainty in order to gain information when performing these actions. In this work, we first try to bridge some of these different methods from the two research fields by rewriting their decision process with a common formalism. We then show numerical simulations of a hybrid algorithm combining bio-inspired meta-learning, kalman filter and exploration bonuses compared to several state-of-the-art alternatives on a set of non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit tasks. While we find that different methods are appropriate in different scenarios, the hybrid algorithm displays a good combination of advantages from different methods and outperforms these methods in the studied scenarios.",1888,180,1077,5.0

Hemelrijk, Guy Theraulaz",138628;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/138628,"Moving animal groups such as schools of fish or flocks of birds often undergo sudden collective changes of their travelling direction as a consequence of stochastic fluctuations in heading of the individuals. However, the mechanisms by which these behavioural fluctuations arise at the individual level and propagate within a group are still unclear. In the present study, we combine an experimental and theoretical approach to investigate spontaneous collective U-turns in groups of rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) swimming in a ring-shaped tank. U-turns imply that fish switch their heading between the clockwise and anticlockwise direction. We reconstruct trajectories of individuals moving alone and in groups of different sizes. We show that the group decreases its swimming speed before a collective U-turn. This is in agreement with previous theoretical predictions showing that speed decrease facilitates an amplification of fluctuations in heading in the group, which can trigger U-turns. These collective U-turns are mostly initiated by individuals at the front of the group. Once an individual has initiated a U-turn, the new direction propagates through the group from front to back without amplification or dampening, resembling the dynamics of falling dominoes. The mean time between collective U-turns sharply increases as the size of the group increases. We develop an Ising spin model integrating anisotropic and asymmetrical interactions between fish and their tendency to follow the majority of their neighbours nonlinearly (social conformity). The model quantitatively reproduces key features of the dynamics and the frequency of collective U-turns observed in experiments.",1856,247,661,10.0

Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like payoff-biased learning, in contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food item and documented the innovation and diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that payoff-biased social learning and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population.",3348,269,925,20.0

When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, we show that answers to the second query vary systematically depending on the structure of the first query.

The prey’s body orientation relative to a predator at the onset of the escape response (initial orientation) could affect evasion outcome, because the turn angle and its duration before the initiation of escape locomotion would be smaller when the initial orientation is more away from the predator. We tested this hypothesis by recording the escape responses of juvenile red sea bream (Pagrus major) in response to the predatory scorpion fish (Sebastiscus marmoratus) using a high-speed video camera. Our results show that an increased initial orientation (i.e., more away from the predator) increases escape probability. Our results also indicate that an increase in the initial orientation decreases the turn angle and its duration. The flight initiation distance tends to be small when the initial orientation is away from the predator, suggesting that the prey might have a blind zone of sensory perception. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating initial orientation into both empirical and theoretical studies of the kinematics of predator-prey interactions.Summary statement Our predator-prey experiments reveal that the prey’s initial body orientation relative to a predator affects the prey’s turn angle and its duration, and consequently affects escape probability.",1655,249,454,25.0

It not only serves as a dynamic and flexible tool for self-expression and linguistic information but also plays a key role in social behaviour. Variation in vocal modulation can be driven by individual traits of the individual interlocutors, as well as by factors relating to the dyad, such as the perceived closeness between interlocutors. Accordingly, the current study examines the role of a) individual differences in autism-related traits, and b) perceived closeness between interlocutors on vocal modulation. Since lack of appropriate vocal modulation is often associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders we also focus on autism-related individual traits. The role of these individual and dyad-level factors on vocal modulation is tested for cultural generalizability by conducting this study in three separate samples from India, Italy, and the UK. Articulatory features were extracted from recorded conversations between a total of 85 same-sex pairs of participants and correlated with their self-reported perceived closeness (CR) to the other member of the pair and with the individual Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Results indicated a significant positive correlation between interpersonal closeness and articulation area in all three samples. A significant negative correlation between AQ and articulation area was observed only in the UK sample.

But why are older behavioral descriptions and newer genetic descriptions of mating systems often seemingly inconsistent? We argue that a potentially important reason for such inconsistencies is a research trajectory rooted in early studies that were equivocal and overreaching, followed by studies that accepted earlier conclusions at face value and assumed, rather than tested, key ideas about animal mating systems. We illustrate our argument using Anolis lizards, whose social behavior has been studied for nearly a century. A dominant view emerging from this behavioral research was that anoles display strict territorial polygyny, where females mate with just the one male in whose territory they reside. However, all genetic evidence suggests that females frequently mate with multiple males. We trace this mismatch to early studies that concluded that anoles are territorial based on limited data. Subsequent research assumed territoriality implicitly or explicitly, resulting in studies that were unlikely to uncover or consider important any evidence of anoles’ departures from strict territorial polygyny. Thus, descriptions of anole behavior were largely led away from predicting a pattern of female multiple mating. We end by considering the broader implications of such erratic trajectories for the study of animal mating systems, and posit that precise definitions, renewed attention to natural history, and explicitly questioning assumptions made while collecting behavioral observations will allow us to move towards a fuller understanding of animal mating systems.",2473,283,1114,33.0

Participants adapted to assigned payoff conditions, performed better in smooth than in rough environments, and—surprisingly—sometimes performed equally well in short as in long search horizons. Our modeling results indicate a preference for local search options, which when accounted for, still suggests participants were best-described as forming local inferences about unexplored regions, combined with a search strategy that directly traded off between exploiting high expected rewards and exploring to reduce uncertainty about the spatial structure of rewards.",2991,231,1666,6.0

Analysis of high-resolution tracking data of known individuals demonstrates that, across a range of contexts, consistent inter-individual differences in social proximity were strongly linked to speed and, together with boldness predicted spatial positioning and leadership within groups, differences in structure and movement dynamics between groups, as well as individual and group foraging performance. These effects of inter-individual behavioural variation on group-level states emerged naturally from a generic model of heterogeneous, self-organising groups. Our study combines experimental and theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain variation in the emergence of structure, dynamics, and functional capabilities of groups across social and ecological scales.

This result was accurately captured by a model which implements Bayesian inference after – not before – sensorimotor transformation. These results indicate that humans perform “late inference” downstream of sensorimotor computations rather than, or in addition to, “early inference” in the perceptual domain.

From our ongoing transcriptomic data annotation of blood fed adult female olfactory tissue of A. culicifacies mosquito, we identified a 383 bp long unique transcript encoding Drosophila homolog of Quick-To-Court protein, previously shown to regulate the courtship behavior in adult male Drosophila. A comprehensive in silico analysis predicts Ac-qtc is 1536 bp long single copy gene encoding 511 AA long protein, having high degree of conservation with other insect homolog. Age dependent increased expression of putative Ac-qtc in the naïve mosquitoes correlates the maturation of olfactory system, necessary to meet sex specific conflicting demand of mating (mate finding) vs. host-seeking behavioral responses. Though, 16-18 hour of starvation did not altered Ac-qtc expression in both the sexes, however blood feeding significantly modulated its response in the adult female mosquitoes, confirming that it may not be involved in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. Finally, a behavioural-cum-molecular assay indicated that natural dysregulation of Ac-qtc in late evening may promotes key mating event of successful insemination process. We hypothesize that Ac-qtc may play unique role to meet and manage the sex specific conflicting demand of mosquito courtship behaviour and/or blood feeding behaviour in the adult female mosquitoes.

We also investigated potential developmental changes, the influence of tentacles, which some of the developmental stages possess, and whether wall-following is active (animals seek out wall contact) or passive. Animals’ swimming movements were recorded with a camera from above in a square tank with shallow water and their trajectories were analysed especially for proximity to the nearest wall. With the exception of young larvae, in which wall following was less strong, the vast majority of animals – tadpoles and froglets – spent more time near the wall than what would be expected from the proportion of the area near the wall. The total distance covered was not a confounding factor. Wall following was also not influenced by whether the surrounding of the tank was black or white, illuminated by infrared light, or by the presence or absence of tentacles. Animals were stronger wall followers in smaller tanks. When given a choice in a convex tank to swim straight and leave the wall or turn to follow the wall, the animals consistently left the wall, indicating that wall following in Xenopus laevis is passive.

We test two hypotheses: The Competition hypothesis suggests that young birds learn more from tutors with whom they compete especially intensely and predicts that tutees will respond with high aggression to tutor songs. In contrast the Cooperation hypothesis suggests that song learning reflects a cooperative relationship between the tutor and the tutee and predicts that tutees will respond with low aggression to tutor songs. In a playback experiment we found that birds respond more aggressively to songs of their tutors than they do to songs of strangers and that the strength of aggressive response correlated positively with how much they had learned from that tutor.

An alternate hypothesis, coming from the study of ritual, proposes that shared practices lead to bonding, increasing parochialism, but not altruism generally. These contradictory hypotheses of the potential effects of shared cultural practices of calming meditation were explored via a formal behavioral experiment using a simple treatment and control format with a short, facilitated breath awareness practice known to produce calm. Altruism and parochialism were measured through anonymous play in Public Goods games performed with both in-group and out-group individuals. The sum of contributions of the two plays gave a measure of altruism, while the difference between the two gave a measure of parochialism. The analysis of the results using Bayesian AICc model comparison methods supports the first hypothesis that calming practices reduces parochialism and increases altruism.

Scrosati, Melisa C. Wong",123653;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/123653,"Predator nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey activity are common in nature. Upon sensing predator cues, a common prey response is to reduce feeding to avoid being detected by predators. Using an aquatic system, this study investigated how prey density and predator cue type affect predator NCEs on prey feeding. Prey density was investigated because, as it increases, the individual risk of being preyed upon decreases, which may reduce NCEs if prey can detect conspecifics. Predator cue type was investigated because waterborne cues would trigger weaker NCEs than waterborne and tactile cues combined, as predation risk may be perceived by prey to be stronger in the second case. Specifically, a factorial experiment tested the hypotheses that (i) increasing dogwhelk (prey) density reduces the limitation that crab (predator) chemical cues can have on dogwhelk consumption of mussels and that (ii) chemical and tactile crab cues combined limit dogwhelk feeding more strongly than chemical crab cues alone. The results broadly supported these hypotheses. On the one hand, crab chemical cues limited the per-capita consumption of mussels by dogwhelks at a low dogwhelk density, but such NCEs disappeared at intermediate and high dogwhelk densities. On the other hand, the combination of chemical and tactile cues from crabs caused stronger NCEs, as dogwhelk consumption of mussels was negatively affected at all three dogwhelk densities. The structurally complex mussel beds may provide not only food for dogwhelks but a refuge from crab predation that allows dogwhelk density to limit crab NCEs when mediated by waterborne cues. Overall, this study suggests that prey evaluate conspecific density when assessing predation risk and that the type of cues prey are exposed to can affect their interpretation of risk.",1077,262,334,15.0

Feedback regulation of nestmate differentiation into reproductives has been suggested, but the sex-specificity remains inconclusive. In the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes, we tested the hypothesis that neotenic reproductives regulate worker-reproductive transition in a sex-specific manner. With this R. flavipes system, we demonstrate a sex-specific regulatory mechanism with both inhibitory and stimulatory functions. Neotenics inhibit workers of the same sex from differentiating into additional reproductives, but stimulate workers of the opposite sex to undergo this transition. Furthermore, this process is not affected by the presence of soldiers.

Applications include the study of cognition in zebrafish (and other similar sized fish species) and in zebrafish models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, Huntington’s disease, frontotemporal dementia), and characterisation of the role of select brain regions, neurotransmitter systems and genes in zebrafish. Further, the scalable nature of the system makes the protocols suitable for use in pharmacological and genetic screening programmes.",2400,457,1167,19.0

Arthropods and vertebrates share neural organizational principles and it has been shown that rodents modulate their neural spatial representation accordingly with environmental changes. However, it is unclear whether insects reflexively adapt to environmental changes or retain memory traces of previously explored situations. We sought to disambiguate between insect behavior at environmental novel situations and reconfiguration conditions. An immersive mixed-reality multi-sensory setup was built to replicate multi-sensory cues. We have designed an experimental setup where female crickets Gryllus Bimaculatus were trained to move towards paired auditory and visual cues during primarily phonotactic driven behavior. We hypothesized that insects were capable of identifying sensory modifications in known environments. Our results show that, regardless of the animals history, novel situation conditions did not compromise the animals performance and navigational directionality towards a novel target location. However, in trials where visual and auditory stimuli were spatially decoupled, the animals heading variability towards a previously known location significantly increased. Our findings showed that crickets are able to behaviorally manifest environmental reconfiguration, suggesting the encoding for spatial representation.",1039,156,636,9.0

Fleming,068601;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/068601,"Metacognition refers to the ability to reflect on and monitor one’s cognitive processes, such as perception, memory and decision-making. Metacognition is often assessed in the lab by whether an observer’s confidence ratings are predictive of objective success, but simple correlations between performance and confidence are susceptible to undesirable influences such as response biases. Recently an alternative approach to measuring metacognition has been developed (Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012) that characterises metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d′) by assuming a generative model of confidence within the framework of signal detection theory. However, current estimation routines require an abundance of confidence rating data to recover robust parameters, and only provide point estimates of meta-d’. In contrast, hierarchical Bayesian estimation methods provide opportunities to enhance statistical power, incorporate uncertainty in group-level parameter estimates and avoid edge-correction confounds. Here I introduce such a method for estimating metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’/d’) from confidence ratings and demonstrate its application for assessing group differences. A tutorial is provided on both the meta-d’ model and the preparation of behavioural data for model fitting. Through numerical simulations I show that a hierarchical approach outperforms alternative fitting methods in situations where limited data are available, such as when quantifying metacognition in patient populations. In addition, the model may be flexibly expanded to estimate parameters encoding other influences on metacognitive efficiency.

Constructing social networks requires quantifying the relationship between each pair of individuals in the population. Researchers often use association indices to convert observations into a measure of propensity for individuals to be seen together. At its simplest, this measure is just the probability of observing both individuals together given that one has been seen (the simple ratio index). However, this probability becomes more challenging to calculate if the detection rate for individuals is imperfect. We first evaluate the performance of existing association indices at estimating true association rates under scenarios where (i) only a proportion of all groups are observed (group location errors), (ii) not all individuals are observed despite being present (individual location errors), and (iii) a combination of the two. Commonly-used methods aimed at dealing with incomplete observations perform poorly because they are based on arbitrary observation probabilities. We then derive complete indices that can be calibrated for the different types of observation probabilities to generate accurate estimates of association rates. These are provided in an R package that readily interfaces with existing routines. We conclude that using calibration data is an important step when constructing animal social networks, and that in their absence, researchers should use a simple estimator and explicitly consider the impact of this on their findings.",2041,863,991,36.0

As a result, it is possible to make quantitative predictions about when and how the behavior will be observed. In this paper, we extend a previous mathematical model of these costs and benefits into a general framework for analyzing the optimal formation, and final configuration, of army ant living bridges. We provide experimentally testable predictions of the final bridge position, as well as the optimal formation process for certain cases, for a wide range of scenarios, which more closely resemble common terrain obstacles that ants encounter in nature. As such, our framework offers a rare benchmark for determining the evolutionary pressures governing the evolution of a naturally occurring collective animal behavior.",1316,436,592,32.0

Thirty-three adults performed a self-face recognition task from a series of self-other face morphs with simultaneous eye-tracking. Participants were found to look at lower part of the face for longer duration for self-face compared to other-face. Participants with a reduced overlap between self and other face representations, as indexed by a steeper slope of the psychometric response curve for self-face recognition, spent a greater proportion of time looking at the upper regions of faces identified as self. Additionally, the association of autism-related traits with self-face processing metrics was tested, since autism has previously been associated with atypical self-processing, particularly in the psychological domain. Autistic traits were associated with reduced looking time to both self and other faces.

Using stochastic gradient descent, we derive how the activity in ‘tutor’ circuits (e.g., LMAN) should match plasticity mechanisms in ‘student’ circuits (e.g., RA) to achieve efficient learning. We further describe a reinforcement learning framework through which the tutor can build its teaching signal. We show that mismatches between the tutor signal and the plasticity mechanism can impair learning. Applied to birdsong, our results predict the temporal structure of the corrective bias from LMAN given a plasticity rule in RA.

Farine",111146;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/111146,"Many animal social structures are organized hierarchically, with dominant individuals monopolizing resources. Dominance hierarchies have received great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists. As a result, there are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established tools for quantifying their uncertainty. In this study, we simulated interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the number of interactions recorded and hierarchy steepness affect the performance of three methods, (2) propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method, and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty in the inferred hierarchy. First, we found that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the hierarchy steepness and method used. We then show that David’s score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the two best methods, whereas the original Elo-rating and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. Finally, we propose two simple methods to estimate uncertainty at the individual and group level. These uncertainty measures further allow to differentiate non-existent, very flat and highly uncertain hierarchies from intermediate, steep and certain hierarchies. Overall, we find that the methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust, even when the ratio of observed interactions to individuals is as low as 10 to 20. However, we suggest that implementing simple procedures for estimating uncertainty will benefit researchers, and quantifying the shape of the dominance hierarchies will provide new insights into the study organisms.HighlightsDavid’s score and the randomized Elo-rating perform best.Method performance depends on hierarchy steepness and sampling effort.Generally, inferring dominance hierarchies requires relatively few observations.The R package “aniDom” allows easy estimation of hierarchy uncertainty.Hierarchy uncertainty provides insights into the shape of the dominance hierarchy.",2740,176,1182,37.0

Here, we investigated whether learning in a high-risk environment, with frequent large prediction errors, gives rise to higher fidelity memory traces than learning in a low-risk environment. In Experiment 1, we showed that higher magnitude prediction errors, positive or negative, improved recognition memory for trial-unique items. Participants also increased their learning rate after large prediction errors. In addition, there was an overall higher learning rate in the low-risk environment. Although unsigned prediction errors enhanced memory and increased learning rate, we did not find a relationship between learning rate and memory, suggesting that these two effects were due to separate underlying mechanisms. In Experiment 2, we replicated these results with a longer task that posed stronger memory demands and allowed for more learning. We also showed improved source and sequence memory for high-risk items. In Experiment 3, we controlled for the difficulty of learning in the two risk environments, again replicating the previous results. Moreover, equating the range of prediction errors in the two risk environments revealed that learning in a high-risk context enhanced episodic memory above and beyond the effect of prediction errors to individual items. In summary, our results across three studies showed that (absolute) prediction error magnitude boosted both episodic memory and incremental learning, but the two effects were not correlated, suggesting distinct underlying systems.",2035,252,996,21.0

In this experiment, we used two eye-tracking tasks to index both of these aspects of social preference in in 77 typical adults. We used two measures, global effect and preferential looking time. The global effect task measures saccadic deviation toward a social stimulus (related to ‘orienting’), while the preferential looking task records gaze duration bias toward social stimuli (relating to ‘engaging’). Social rewards were found to elicit greater saccadic deviation and greater gaze duration bias, suggesting that they have both greater salience and higher value compared to nonsocial rewards.

The San Juan Bay Estuary System in Puerto Rico is one such ecosystem that has undergone an increase in hypoxic events over the past few years. We collected white grunts (Haemulon plumieri) from one of the estuary lagoons to study the effects of hypoxia on fast startle responses (fast-starts). We hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia would significantly decrease the frequency of fast-starts evoked by an abrupt sound stimulus. After an exposure to an oxygen concentration of 2.5 mg L-1 (40% of air saturation), there is a significant reduction in the frequency of fast-starts that is maintained for at least 24 h after the exposure. Exposure to a random sequence of oxygen levels of 5.0, 4.3 and 3.7 mg L-1 (80, 70, and 60% of air saturation) did not show a significant effect until one hour after exposure. We speculate that the lasting effect of hypoxia on fast-starts, thought to be involved in escape, will result in a greater susceptibility of the white grunt to predation. We have identified the Mauthner cell, known to initiate fast-starts, to allow future studies on how low oxygen levels impact a single cell and its circuit, the behavior it initiates and ultimately how changes in the behavior affect population and ecosystem levels.",1011,566,474,35.0

Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: selecting an action from several alternatives, and choosing its vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Both of these dimensions depend on the values of the outcomes, and these values are often affected as more outcomes are consumed, and so are the actions. Despite this, previous works have addressed the computational substrates of optimal actions only in the specific condition that the values of outcomes are constant, and it is still unknown what the optimal actions are when the values of outcomes are non-stationary. Here, based on an optimal control framework, we derive a computational model for optimal actions under non-stationary outcome values. The results imply that even when the values of outcomes are changing, the optimal response rate is constant rather than decreasing. This finding shows that, in contrast to previous theories, the commonly observed changes in the actions cannot be purely attributed to the changes in the outcome values. We then prove that this observation can be explained based on the uncertainty about temporal horizons; e.g., in the case of experimental protocols, the session duration. We further show that when multiple outcomes are available, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies. The model provides, therefore, a quantitative analysis of optimal actions and explicit predictions for future testing.",1116,137,425,31.0

We investigated this issue using the decision task involving multiple goal-directed event sequences, in which a contextual cue specifies an associated target and touch to the target delivers the reward. We found that the gaze followed the sequence of contextual cue to the associated target, which was eventually chosen. This fixation sequence from contextual cue to the associated target could be observed even when there were multiple goals and when the focus was shifted from one goal to another. To causally investigate the effects of sequential simulation, we directly manipulated the processing of the contextual cues and found its influence on the final choice of target. Furthermore, past episodes of the sequences influenced both final choices of targets and initial gaze to contextual cues.

The most obvious differences are the number and type of photoreceptors in the retina. E.g., while humans are insensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, most non-mammal vertebrates and insects have a colour vision that spans into the UV. The development of colour vision models allowed appraisals of colour vision independent of the human experience. These models are now widespread in ecology and evolution fields. Here I present a guide to colour vision modelling, run a series of simulations, and provide a R package – colourvision – to facilitate the use of colour vision models.I present the mathematical steps for calculation of the most commonly used colour vision models: Chittka (1992) colour hexagon, Endler &amp; Mielke (2005) model, and Vorobyev &amp; Osorio (1998) linear and log-linear receptor noise limited models (RNL). These models are then tested using identical simulated and real data. These comprise of reflectance spectra generated by a logistic function against an achromatic background, achromatic reflectance against an achromatic background, achromatic reflectance against a chromatic background, and real flower reflectance data against a natural background reflectance.When the specific requirements of each model are met, between model results are, overall, qualitatively and quantitatively similar. However, under many common scenarios of colour measurements, models may generate spurious values and/or considerably different predictions. Models that log-transform data and use relative photoreceptor outputs are prone to generate unrealistic results when the stimulus photon catch is smaller than the background photon catch. Moreover, models may generate unrealistic results when the background is chromatic (e.g. leaf reflectance) and the stimulus is an achromatic low reflectance spectrum.Colour vision models are a valuable tool in several ecology and evolution subfields. Nonetheless, knowledge of model assumptions, careful analysis of model outputs, and basic knowledge of calculation behind each model are crucial for appropriate model application, and generation of meaningful and reproducible results. Other aspects of vision not incorporated into these models should be considered when drawing conclusion from model results.",2033,389,1174,30.0

Instead of requiring decisions about a constant set of repetitively presented stimuli, we studied the macaque’s ability to determine the relative order of multiple exemplars of particular stimuli that were rarely repeated. Ordinal decisions generalized both to novel stimuli and, as a consequence, to novel pairings. Thus, we showed that rhesus monkeys could learn to categorize on the basis of implied ordinal position, and that they could then make inferences about category order. Our results challenge the plausibility of association models of category learning and broaden the scope of the transitive inference paradigm.Significance Statement The cognitive abilities of non-human animals are of enduring interest to scientists and the general public because they blur the dividing line between human and non-human intelligence.

Such phasic cycles are thought to be adaptive because they minimize the amount of foraging and the related costs, and at the same time enhance the colony-level ability to rely on patchily distributed food sources. In order to investigate these hypotheses, we use here a simple computational approach to study the population dynamics of two species of virtual ant colonies that differ quantitatively in their foraging investment. One species, which we refer to as “phasic”, forages only half of the time, mirroring the phasic activity of some army ants; the other “non-phasic” species forages instead all the time. We show that, when foraging costs are relatively high, populations of phasic colonies grow on average faster than non-phasic populations, outcompeting them in mixed populations. Interestingly, such tendency becomes more consistent as food becomes more difficult to find but locally abundant. According to our results, reducing the foraging investment, for example by adopting a phasic lifestyle, can result in a reproductive advantage, but only in specific conditions. We thus suggest phasic colony cycles to have emerged together with the doryline specialization in feeding on the brood of other eusocial insects, a resource that is hard to obtain but highly abundant if available.",1097,121,329,19.0

However, in the absence of food, the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient of this alkaloid, chose a similar nicotine concentration like naive worms.

They are potent antioxidants, and in several recent studies the ingestion of anthocyanins has been linked to positive health benefits for humans. Here, we show that when given a choice between two alternative samples of cabbage to ingest, captive born orangutans (n = 6) voluntarily chose the sample that contained greater amounts of anthocyanin. This occurred when they had to decide between samples of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata f. rubra) from the same plant (p&lt;0.05), and samples from green cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) (p&lt;0.01). This indicates that anthocyanin holds a reward value for these hominids. There was no difference in L*a*b* colour between ingested and discarded samples in red cabbage, but when the choice was between two green samples, the animals chose samples that were more green and yellow. There was also no difference in the amount of lightness (L*) between chosen and discarded samples of either plant. It is therefore unclear if the animals use leaf colour in decision-making.

Keerthipriya, T.N.C. Vidya",099614;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/099614,"We report on female Asian elephant social structure in Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks (Kabini population), southern India, and examine the role of group size in affecting the outcome of social structure analysis in female elephants, which show high fission-fusion dynamics. Based on five years of data, we found the Kabini association network structured into highly modular communities that we call clans. We then modified the dataset (to obtain the Kabini 500-m dataset) to match sampling methods previously used in a study each of Asian (Uda Walawe) and African savannah (Samburu) elephants, so that network and association statistics could be compared across populations. Measures of association and network structure previously used were more similar amongst the Asian elephant populations compared to Samburu. The Samburu population formed a hierarchically-nested multilevel society whereas the Asian populations did not. However, we found hierarchical clustering levels in all three populations using Louvain community detection. Moreover, the average community sizes obtained through the Louvain method were not significantly different across populations, indicating basic similarities in social structure. Since fission-fusion dynamics allow for community members to form groups of different sizes, we examined the effect of average group size on association and network statistics. Higher average association index and degree, and lower average path length in Samburu compared to the Kabini 500-m dataset were explained by the larger average group size in Samburu. Thus, underlying similarities in the social networks of species showing fission-fusion dynamics may be obscured by differences in average group size.Significance Statement Various measures of associations and social network analyses have been used to compare social structures of different populations. We studied the social structure of female Asian elephants in a southern Indian population and compared it with those of a Sri Lankan Asian elephant population and an African savannah elephant population. We showed that, while there were social differences between the Asian and African savannah elephant populations using previous methods, there were basic similarities across all three populations using a method of network community detection. This discrepancy across analyses partly stemmed from differences in average group size between populations. Average group size in fission-fusion societies variously affected different association and network statistics, which has implications for inferences about social structure.",1389,190,644,40.0

We asked if a comparable phenomenon exists in zebrafish (Danio rerio) that live in shoals in the wild. In the first experiment, we observed that most quantifiable parameters of swimming behavior were similar when zerbafish swam alone or with companions. However, after exposure to an alarm substance (Schreckstoff), individuals recovering alone continued to display behaviors associated with fear after removal of the stimulus, while those recovering with companions did not. In the next two experiments, we examined the role of familiarity of companions. Subjects spent more time in the vicinity of familiar companions in a two-choice assay. While both familiar and unfamiliar companions reduced behavioral signs of distress, familiar companions additionally modulated cortisol and endogenous isotocin in subjects. Shortly after being united with familiar companions, isotocin spiked followed by a dampening of circulating cortisol levels. These results suggest that zebrafish experience fear attenuation in the presence of others and familiar companions are more effective at buffering the stress associated with escaping predation. Changes in behavior, circulating cortisol and isotocin levels due to social partners are reminiscent of changes due to amelioration of fear in some mammalian species in the presence of companions. The two phenomena may be related.",1661,152,708,28.0

Drosophila melanogaster is attracted to fermenting fruit for feeding and egg-laying. We show that, in addition, female flies release a pheromone (Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al), that elicits flight attraction in both sexes. The biosynthetic precursor of Z4-11Al is the cuticular hydrocarbon (Z,Z)-7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), which is known to afford reproductive isolation between the sibling species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. A pair of alternatively spliced receptors, Or69aB and Or69aA, is tuned to Z4-11Al and to food olfactory cues, respectively. These receptors are co-expressed in the same olfactory sensory neurons, and feed into a neural circuit mediating species-specific, long-range communication: the close relative D. simulans, which shares food resources and co-occurs with D. melanogaster, does not respond. That Or69aA and Or69aB have adopted dual olfactory traits highlights the interplay of habitat and social signals in mate finding. These olfactory receptor genes afford a collaboration between natural and sexual selection, which has the potential to drive phylogenetic divergence.Significance Statement Volatile insect sex pheromones carry a message over a distance, they are perceived by dedicated olfactory receptors, and elicit a sequence of innate behaviours. Pheromones mediate specific mate recognition, but are embedded in and perceived together with environmental olfactory cues. We have identified the first long-range, species-specific pheromone in Drosophila melanogaster. A pair of spliced olfactory receptors, feeding into the same neural circuit, has developed a dual affinity to this pheromone and kairomones, encoding adult and larval food. Blends of this pheromone and kairomone specifically attract D. melanogaster, but not the close relative D. simulans.

Psychophysical measures provide an objective yet indirect characterization of this experience by describing the dependency between the physical properties of a stimulus and the corresponding perceptually guided behavior2. Two fundamental psychophysical measures characterize an observer’s perception of a stimulus: how well the observer can discriminate the stimulus from similar ones (discrimination threshold) and how strongly the observer’s perceived stimulus value deviates from the true stimulus value (perceptual bias). It has long been thought that these two perceptual characteristics are independent3. Here we demonstrate that discrimination threshold and perceptual bias show a surprisingly simple mathematical relation. The relation, which we derived from assumptions of optimal sensory encoding and decoding4, is well supported by a wide range of reported psychophysical data5–16 including perceptual changes induced by spatial17,18 and temporal19–23 context, and attention24.

Experimental evidence for these expectations and their violations include explicit reports, sequential effects on reaction times, and mismatch or surprise signals recorded in electrophysiology and functional MRI. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the brain acts as a near-optimal inference device that constantly attempts to infer the time-varying matrix of transition probabilities between the stimuli it receives, even when those stimuli are in fact fully unpredictable. This parsimonious Bayesian model, with a single free parameter, accounts for a broad range of findings on surprise signals, sequential effects and the perception of randomness. Notably, it explains the pervasive asymmetry between repetitions and alternations encountered in those studies. Our analysis suggests that a neural machinery for inferring transition probabilities lies at the core of human sequence knowledge.Author SummaryWe explore the possibility that the computation of time-varying transition probabilities may be a core building block of sequence knowledge in humans. Humans may then use these estimates to predict future observations. Expectations derived from such a model should conform to several properties. We list six such properties and we test them successfully against various experimental findings reported in distinct fields of the literature over the past century. We focus on five representative studies by other groups. Such findings include the “sequential effects” evidenced in many behavioral tasks, i.e. the pervasive fluctuations in performance induced by the recent history of observations. We also consider the “surprise-like” signals recorded in electrophysiology and even functional MRI, that are elicited by a random stream of observations. These signals are reportedly modulated in a quantitative manner by both the local and global statistics of observations. Last, we consider the notoriously biased subjective perception of randomness, i.e. whether humans think that a given sequence of observations has been generated randomly or not. Our model therefore unifies many previous findings and suggest that a neural machinery for inferring transition probabilities must lie at the core of human sequence knowledge.",3776,210,1236,53.0

Such preferences likely reflect evolutionary adaptations to predictable situations and have traditionally been conceptualized as hard-wired stimulus-response links. Perhaps therefore, the century-old discovery of flexibility in Drosophila phototaxis has received little attention. Here we report that across several different behavioral tests, light/dark preference tested in walking is dependent on various aspects of flight. If we temporarily compromise flying ability, walking photopreference reverses concomitantly. Neuronal activity in circuits expressing dopamine and octopamine, respectively, plays a differential role in photopreference, suggesting a potential involvement of these biogenic amines in this case of behavioral flexibility. We conclude that flies monitor their ability to fly, and that flying ability exerts a fundamental effect on action selection in Drosophila. This work suggests that even behaviors which appear simple and hard-wired comprise a value-driven decision-making stage, negotiating the external situation with the animal’s internal state, before an action is selected.",5730,790,1788,41.0

Such behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions1,5, but free-living individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators6–10. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (e.g. prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (e.g. group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring)6–9,11. The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood5–7,9. Here, we address this in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization12 where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally-incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within– and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parent’s incubation bout varied from 1 – 19 hours, while period length–the time in which a parent’s probability to incubate cycles once between its highest and lowest value – varied from 6 – 43 hours. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light-dark cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity5–7,9. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms.",25916,181,2010,22.0

The pigment in the yellow scales is 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK), found also in the hair and scales of a variety of animals. In other butterflies including pierids, which similarly display wing colors that vary in both the UV and the human-visible range, behavioral experiments have indicated that only the UV component is most relevant to mate choice. Whether in Heliconius butterflies it is the UV, the human-visible yellow, and/or the fluorescent component of yellow wing coloration that is relevant to mate choice is unknown. In field studies with butterfly paper models we show that both UV and 3-OHK yellow act as signals for H. erato but attack rates by birds do not differ significantly between the models. Furthermore, measurement of the quantum yield and reflectance spectra of 3-OHK indicates that fluorescence does not contribute to the visual signal under broad-spectrum illumination.

Barbering behavior (BB) has been observed in laboratory animals and proposed as TTM model. The neurobiological basis of TTM is not clear, but it seems to involve striatal hyperactivity parallel to hypoactivation of prefrontal cortex. In this study we observed that knockout mice to the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) exhibit exacerbated BB following the 4th week of age, as well as increased repetitive movements compared to wild-type mice (WT). These behaviors are associated to decreased levels of NMDA receptor subunit (NR1) in prefrontal cortex, while an increase was observed in striatum of NOS2KO compared to WT. Striatal neurons from NOS2KO also exhibited increased number of branches compared to WT. The repeated treatment with clomipramine, a clinically approved drug to treat TTM in humans, or memantine, an antagonist of NMDA receptors, as well as partial rescue of NOS2 expression in haploinsufficient animals, attenuated the expression of BB. The silencing of NOS2 expression reduced the MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) levels in activity-induced differentiated PC12 cells.

Expectations should be updated only when the organism believes genuine change has occurred. Although individual variables can be highly unreliable, organisms can take advantage of the fact that changes tend to be correlated (e.g., movement of prey will tend to produce changes in both visual and olfactory modalities). Thus, observing a change in one variable provides information about the rate of change for other variables. We call this the penumbra of learning. At the neural level, the penumbra of learning may offer an explanation for why strong plasticity in one synapse can rescue weak plasticity at another (synaptic tagging and capture). At the behavioral level, it has been observed that weak learning of one task can be rescued by novelty exposure before or after the learning task.

Reinforcement-learning models provide formal and testable characterizations of the mechanisms of decision-making; here, we examine avoidance in these terms. One hundred and one healthy and pathologically anxious individuals completed an approach-avoidance go/no-go task under stress induced by threat of unpredictable shock.

In zebrafish, ventral habenula (vHb) neurons have been proposed to participate in both steps by encoding the expected aversiveness of a stimulus. vHb neurons increase their firing rate as expectation of punishment grows, but reduce their activity as avoidance learning occurs. How the change in vHb activity occurs is not known. Here, we ask whether the neuromodulator kisspeptin1, which is expressed in the ventral habenula, could be involved. Kiss1 mutants were generated with Cas9 using guide RNAs targeted to the signal sequence. Mutants, which have a stop codon upstream of the kisspeptin1 peptide, have a deficiency in learning to avoid a shock that is predicted by light. Electrophysiology indicates that kisspeptin1 has a concentration-dependent effect on vHb neurons: depolarizing at low concentrations and hyperpolarizing at high concentrations. These data suggest that as the fish learns to cope with a threat, kisspeptin1 may differentially modulate vHb neurons. This implies that learning a behavioral strategy to overcome a stressor is accompanied by physiological change in habenula neurons.Significance statement Learning to deal with adversity can positively affect one’s ability to cope with challenges in the immediate future. Control thus causes short-term change in the brain. Here, we show that the neuromodulator kisspeptin1 is required to learn to avoid a punishment. Expression and electrophysiological recordings suggest that this molecule functions by controlling the ventral habenula, a region of the brain that mediates fear by regulating serotonin release.

By using a combination of behavioral and morphometric methods, we found that both nicotine and food modulate worm behavior. In the presence of food the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient, chose a similar nicotine concentration like C. elegans adapted to the high nicotine concentration. However, in the absence of food, the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient of this alkaloid, chose a similar nicotine concentration like naïve worms. The nematodes growing up in the presence of high concentrations of nicotine had a statistically smaller body size, compared to the control condition, and the presence of food did not cause any enhanced slowing movement. These results provide a platform for more detailed molecular and cellular studies of nicotine addiction and food intake in this model organism.",1052,313,433,32.0

Neonates of species that require parental care (e.g. human babies and chicks of the domestic fowl) are attracted by stimuli associated with animate social partners, such as face-like configurations, biological motion and self-propulsion. The property of being filled is used as a cue of animacy by 8-month-old infants but it is not known whether this reflects the effect of previous experience. We use chicks of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) to investigate whether the property of being filled vs. hollow elicits spontaneous or learned preferences. To this aim we tested preferences of naΪve and imprinted chicks for hollow and closed cylinders. Contrary to our expectations, we documented an unlearned attraction for hollow stimuli. The preference for hollow stimuli decreased when chicks were imprinted on filled stimuli but did not increase when chicks were imprinted on hollow stimuli, suggesting that this feature is not crucial to categorize the familiarity of imprinting objects. When chicks were imprinted on occluded stimuli that could be either filled or hollow, the preference for hollow stimuli emerged again, showing that imprinting does not disrupt the spontaneous preference for hollow objects. Further experiments revealed that hollow objects were mainly attractive by means of depth cues such as darker innards, more than as places to hide or as objects with high contrast. Our findings point to predisposed preferences for hollow objects that might be unrelated to social behaviour.",1852,200,399,23.0

Dalzell",061101;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/061101,"Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) employ a sophisticated chemosensory apparatus to detect potential hosts. Understanding the molecular basis of relevant host-finding behaviours could facilitate improved EPN biocontrol approaches, and could lend insight to similar behaviours in economically important mammalian parasites. FMRFamide-like peptides are enriched and conserved across the Phylum Nematoda, and have been linked with motor and sensory function, including dispersal and aggregating behaviours in the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway of Steinernema carpocapsae was characterised in silico, and employed to knockdown the expression of the FMRFamide-like protein 21 (GLGPRPLRFamide) gene (flp-21) in S. carpocapsae infective juveniles; a first instance of RNAi in this genus, and a first in an infective juvenile of any EPN species. Our data show that 5 mg/ml dsRNA and 50 mM serotonin triggers statistically significant flp-21 knockdown (-84%***) over a 48 h timecourse, which inhibits host-finding (chemosensory), dispersal, hyperactive nictation and jumping behaviours. However, whilst 1 mg/ml dsRNA and 50 mM serotonin also triggers statistically significant flp-21 knockdown (-51%**) over a 48 h timecourse, it does not trigger the null sensory phenotypes; statistically significant target knockdown can still lead to false negative results, necessitating appropriate experimental design. SPME GC-MS volatile profiles of two EPN hosts, Galleria mellonella and Tenebrio molitor reveal an array of shared and unique compounds; these differences had no impact on null flp-21 RNAi phenotypes for the behaviours assayed. Localisation of flp-21 / FLP-21 to paired anterior neurons by whole mount in situ hybridisation and immunocytochemistry corroborates the RNAi data, further suggesting a role in sensory modulation. These data can underpin efforts to study these behaviours in other economically important parasites, and could facilitate molecular approaches to EPN strain improvement for biocontrol.Author summary Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) use a range of behaviours in order to find a suitable host, some of which are shared with important mammalian parasites. The ethical burden of conducting research on parasites which require a mammalian host has driven a move towards appropriate ‘model’ parasites, like EPNs, which have short life cycles, can be cultured in insects or agar plates, and have excellent genomic resources. This study aimed to develop a method for triggering gene knockdown by RNA interference, a biochemical pathway involved in gene regulation. Through knocking down the expression of a target gene we can then study the function of that gene, helping us to understand the molecular basis of behaviour. Here we have characterised the RNAi pathway of Steinernema carpocapsae through analysing the genome sequence for relevant genes, and have successfully knocked down the neuropeptide gene flp-21 in S. carpocapsae infective juveniles. We find that it is involved in the regulation of behaviours which rely on sensory perception and relate to host-finding. We have localised the gene and mature neuropeptide, and find them to be expressed in paired anterior neurons, which is in broad agreement with our behavioural observations following RNAi. Our observations are relevant to interactions of S. carpocapsae with two insect hosts, the waxworm Galleria mellonella, and the meelworm, Tenebrio molitor. We identified the volatile compounds relating to both insects, and find that there are both shared and unique compounds to both species; EPNs use volatile compound gradients, as well as other physical cues in order to find and invade a host. This study provides a method for employing RNAi in a promising model parasite, and characterises the molecular basis of host-finding behaviours which could be relevant to economically important mammalian parasites. EPNs are also used as bioinsecticides, and so understanding their behaviour and biology could have broad benefits across industry and academia.",2438,255,888,56.0

Whether this phenomenon arises from modification of the contents of the memory trace or its accessibility is a matter of considerable debate. We develop a computational theory that incorporates both mechanisms. Modification of the contents of the memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is accessed (and thus made eligible for modification) depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation. Simulations demonstrate that our model can reproduce the major experimental findings from studies of memory modification in the Pavlovian conditioning literature, including dependence on the strength and age of memories, the interval between memory retrieval and extinction, and prediction errors following retrieval.",3919,247,1847,55.0

Stover",073262;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/073262,"Behavioral syndromes are widely recognized as important for ecology and evolution, but most predictions about ecological impacts are based on conceptual models and are therefore imprecise. Borrowing insights from the theory of demographic heterogeneity, we derived insights about the population-dynamic effects of behavioral syndromes. If some individuals are consistently more aggressive than others, not just in interspecific contests, but also in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior, then population dynamics could be affected by the resulting heterogeneity in demographic rates. We modeled a population with a boldness-aggressiveness syndrome (with the individual's trait constant through life), showing that the mortality cost of boldness causes aggressive individuals to die earlier, on average, than their non-aggressive siblings. The equilibrium frequency of the aggressive type is strongly affected by the mortality cost of boldness, but not directly by the reproductive benefit of aggressiveness. Introducing aggressive types into a homogeneous non-aggressive population increases the average per-capita mortality rate at equilibrium; under many conditions, this reduces the equilibrium density. One such condition is that the reproductive benefit of aggression is frequency dependent and the population has evolved to equalize the expected fitness of the two types. Finally, if the intensity of aggressiveness can evolve, then the population is likely to evolve to an evolutionarily stable trait value under biologically reasonable assumptions. This analysis shows how a formal model can predict both how a syndrome affects population dynamics and how the population processes constrain evolution of the trait; we suggest some concrete predictions.",1260,158,463,24.0

The Shank3/F and Shank3/J models mimick gene mutations associated with Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome and the Cacna1c model recapitulates the deletion underlying Timothy syndrome. The current study utilizes both standard and novel, computer-vision based behavioral tests, the same methdology used in our previously published companion report on the Cntnap2 null and 16p11.2 deletion models. Overall, some but not all behaviors replicated published findings. Those that replicated, such as social behavior and overgrooming in Shank3 models, also tended to be milder than previous reports. The Shank3/F model, and to a much lesser extent, the Shank3/J and Cacna1c models, showed hypoactivity and a general anxiety-like behavior triggered by external stimuli which pervaded social interactions. We did not detect deficits in a cognitive procedural learning test nor did we observe perseverative behavior in these models. We did, however, find differences in exploratory patterns of Cacna1c mutant mice suggestive of a behavioral effect in a social setting. In addition, Shank3/F but not Shank3/J KO or Cacna1c HET showed differences in sensory-gating. Discrepancies in our current results from previous reports may be dependent on subtle differences in testing conditions, housing enrichment, or background strain.

Their disturbance (e.g. in human neonates at risk for autism), may compromise the proper development of a social brain. The genetic bases of such predispositions are unknown. Here we take advantage of well-known visual preferences exhibited by newly-hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) for the head/neck region of their mother hen, to investigate the presence of segregating variation in the predispositions to approach a stuffed hen vs. a scrambled version of it. We compared the spontaneous preferences of three different breeds that have been maintained genetically isolated for at least eighteen years and identically raised in the same farm. Visually-naïve chicks of all the three tested breeds (Padovana, Polverara and Robusta maculata) showed the same initial preference for the predisposed stimulus, suggesting that the direction of the initial preference might be genetically fixed. A few minutes later though, striking differences emerged between breeds, which could indicate early different strategies of dealing with affiliative objects: while the Polverara breed maintained a constant preference across the entire test, the Padovana and Robusta breeds progressively explored the alternative stimulus more. We argue that exploration of novelty might help chicks to look for responsive parental objects and to form a more structured representation of the mother hen. We hence documented the presence of inherited genetic variability for early social predisposition in interaction with environmental stimuli.",1329,214,307,25.0

To better understand this contribution, we coupled the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE) fear conditioning paradigm with presentations of distinct visual scenes displayed on 4 LCD screens surrounding a conditioning chamber. Adult male Long-Evans rats received non-reinforced context pre-exposure on Day 1, an immediate 1.5 mA foot shock on Day 2, and a non-reinforced context test on Day 3. Rats were pre-exposed to either digital Context (dCtx) A, dCtx B, a distinct Context C, or no context on Day 1. Context A and B were identical except for the visual image displayed on the LCD monitors. Immediate shock and retention testing occurred in dCtx A. Rats pre-exposed dCtx A showed the CPFE with significantly higher levels of freezing compared to learning controls. Rats pre-exposed to Context B failed to show the CPFE, with freezing that did not differ significantly from any group. The results suggest that 1) visual information contributes to contextual fear learning in rats and that 2) visual components of the context can be parametrically controlled via LCD screens. Our approach offers a simple modification to contextual fear conditioning whereby the visual features of a context can be precisely controlled to better understand how rodents discriminate and generalize fear across environments.",1331,349,536,9.0

Here we present an experiment in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a biparental songbird with wide geographic distribution, asking whether parental care is strategically adjusted in response to signals of offspring need and brood value and whether glucocorticoids are involved in these adjustments. Using an automated playback system, we carried out playbacks of nestling begging calls specifically to females in two populations differing in their brood value: a northern population in Ontario, Canada (relatively high brood value) and a southern population in North Carolina, USA (lower brood value). We quantified female offspring provisioning rates before and during playbacks and plasma corticosterone levels (cort) once during late incubation and once immediately after playbacks. Females in both populations increased feeding rates temporarily during the first two hours of playback but the increase was not sustained for the entire duration of playback (six hours). Cort levels from samples at the end of the playback did not differ between control females and females that received playbacks. However, females that had higher increases in cort between the incubation and nestling period had greater fledging success. These results suggest that females are able to strategically respond to offspring need, although the role of glucocorticoids in this strategic adjustment remains unclear.",1416,151,453,25.0

Berns",062703;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/062703,"Dogs are hypersocial with humans, and their integration into human social ecology makes dogs a unique model for studying cross-species social bonding. However, the proximal neural mechanisms driving dog-human social interaction are unknown. We used fMRI in 15 awake dogs to probe the neural basis for their preferences for social interaction and food reward. In a first experiment, we used the ventral caudate as a measure of intrinsic reward value and compared activation to conditioned stimuli that predicted food, praise, or nothing. Relative to the control stimulus, the caudate was significantly more active to the reward-predicting stimuli and showed roughly equal or greater activation to praise versus food in 13 of 15 dogs. To confirm that these differences were driven by the intrinsic value of social praise, we performed a second imaging experiment in which the praise was withheld on a subset of trials. The difference in caudate activation to the receipt of praise, relative to its withholding, was strongly correlated with the differential activation to the conditioned stimuli in the first experiment. In a third experiment, we performed an out-of-scanner choice task in which the dog repeatedly selected food or owner in a Y-maze. The relative caudate activation to food-and praise-predicting stimuli in Experiment 1 was a strong predictor of each dog’s sequence of choices in the Y-maze. Analogous to similar neuroimaging studies of individual differences in human social reward, our findings demonstrate a neural mechanism for preference in domestic dogs that is stable within, but variable between, individuals. Moreover, the individual differences in the caudate responses indicate the potentially higher value of social than food reward for some dogs and may help to explain the apparent efficacy of social interaction in dog training.",13402,2807,4229,28.0

Using high resolution behavioral tracking of individual flies in different sensory environments, we tested the power law by making maggots trace different trajectory types in naturalistic conditions, from reaching-like movements to scribbles. In all these conditions, we found that the law holds, and also that the exponent of the larval scaling law approaches 3/4, rather than the usual 2/3 exponent found in almost all human situations. This is consistent with recent findings on humans drawing ellipses on water, where dynamic effects related to medium viscosity have been shown to increase the exponent that would emerge from purely kinematic-geometric constraints. To our knowledge, the speed-curvature power law has only been studied in human and non-human primates, our work then being the first demonstration of the speed-curvature scaling principle in other species. As there are still different competing hypotheses for the origin of such law in humans (one invoking complex cortical computations in primates; another postulating its emergence from the coupling of viscoelastic muscle properties with simple central pattern generation) our findings in the larva demonstrate that the law is possible in an animal with a nervous system orders of magnitude simpler than that of humans, thus supporting the latter view. Given that our discovery is in Drosophila (amenable to precise genetic manipulations, electron microscopy reconstruction of neural circuits, imaging in behaving animals, electrophysiology, and other techniques) this opens great potential for uncovering the mechanistic implementation of the velocity-curvature power law. Such scaling laws might exist because natural selection favors processes that remain behaviorally efficient across a wide range of contexts in distantly related species.

The conditions for this social magnification are very natural, but were absent in previous decision-making models due to extra assumptionsthat simplified mathematical analysis, like very low levels of stochasticity or the assumption that when one option is good the other one must be bad.

Here, we studied human learning behaviour in both asocial and social multi-armed bandit tasks. By fitting reinforcement learning models including asocial and/or social decision processes, we measured each individual’s (1) asocial exploration tendency and (2) social information use. We found consistent individual differences in the exploration tendency in the asocial tasks. We also found substantive heterogeneity in the adopted learning strategies in the social task: One-third of participants were most likely to have used the copy-when-uncertain strategy, while the remaining two-thirds were most likely to have relied only on asocial learning. However, we found no significant individual association between the exploration frequency in the asocial task and the use of the social learning strategy in the social task.

We examine such collective problem solving by studying obstacle navigation during cooperative transport in ants. In cooperative transport, a group of ants works together to move a large object back to their nest. We blocked cooperative transport groups of Paratrechinal longicornis with obstacles of varying complexity, analyzing groups trajectories to infer what kind of strategy the ants employed. Simple strategies require little information, but more challenging, robust strategies succeed with a wider range of obstacles. We found that transport groups use a stochastic strategy that leads to efficient navigation around simple obstacles, and still succeeds at difficult ones. While groups navigating obstacles preferentially move directly toward the nest, they change their behavior over time; the longer the ants are obstructed, the more likely they are to move away from the nest. This increases the chance of finding a path around the obstacle. Groups rapidly changed directions and rarely stalled during navigation, indicating that these ants maintain consensus even when the nest direction is blocked. While some decisions were aided by the arrival of new ants, at many key points direction changes were initiated within the group, with no apparent external cause. This ant species is highly effective at navigating complex environments, and implements a flexible strategy that works quickly for simple obstacles and still succeeds with complex obstacles.",1382,150,554,22.0

We model mechanisms of coordination among ants during cooperative transport, a challenging task that requires a consensus on travel direction. Decisions required for cooperative transport differ from other, well-studied consensus decisions because groups often deadlock, with individuals trying to move in opposing directions, and cooperative transport groups are often relatively small. Small groups may be more affected by individual nonconformity. Using deterministic and stochastic models, we investigate behavioral factors that affect deadlock duration. Our goal is to determine whether groups following simple behavioral rules can reach a consensus using minimal information. We define and investigate multiple types of behavioral rules that govern individual behavior and also differ in the information available. We find that if individuals more readily give up when they are going against the majority, groups rapidly break deadlocks. This occurs through positive and negative feedbacks that are implemented in our model via a single mechanism. We also find that to quickly reach a consensus, groups must have either a shared bias, high sensitivity to group behavior, or finely tuned persistence. While inspired by ants, our results are generalizable to other collective decisions with deadlocks, and demonstrate that groups of behaviorally simple individuals with no memory and extremely limited information can break symmetry and reach a consensus in a decision between two equal options",1220,142,384,26.0

If only true believers are willing to endure ritual behaviors and true belief also entails belief in altruistic cooperation, associating with other ritual practitioners can help solve cooperation dilemmas in groups by sorting out potential free-riders. While this hypothesis is obviously true if such ‘faking’ of ritual is strictly impossible, strict impossibility seems implausible. ‘Faking’ is defined by Irons in this context to be to be performing the ritual without commitment to group beliefs. In this paper, I posit various ways that such faking might be difficult, instead of impossible, or different ways in which such ritual faking might be ‘costly’ and then formally model the social learning and cultural evolution dynamics to see where it may still hold theoretically that such rituals help maintain altruism in group and under what conditions. Analytic solution for evolutionary equilibrium is derived for each model, verifying that under a wide range of conditions for some, but not all interpretations, such hard-to fake rituals can help groups solve cooperative dilemmas, including in some circumstances that might not be intuitively obvious, such as where such free-riding is not visible and free-riders successfully represent themselves as true believers to observers.It is also the case that while there has been some progress in cleaning up the definitional confusions in the animal signaling literature around costly signaling, the literature on human rituals as costly signals has introduced novel uses of the term ‘cost’. Theories referring to completely different mechanisms or even definitions of ‘cost’ are sometimes conflated. To contextualize the analysis of costly-to-fake rituals, this paper provides a review of the ideas proposed in the literature on costly human rituals and differentiates them from costly signaling as used in the animal behavior literature.",1636,128,1110,20.0

To reconcile the effect sizes of purported anxiety factors, we conducted systematic review and meta-analyses of the literature on ten anxiety-linked interventions, as examined in the elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box assays. Diazepam, 5-HT1A receptor gene knockout and overexpression, SERT gene knockout and overexpression, pain, restraint, social isolation, corticotropin-releasing hormone and Crhr1 were selected for review. Eight interventions had statistically significant effects on rodent anxiety, while Htr1a overexpression and Crh knockout did not. Evidence for publication bias was found in the diazepam, Htt knockout, and social isolation literatures. The Htr1a and Crhr1 results indicate a disconnect between preclinical science and clinical research. Furthermore, the meta-analytic data confirmed that genetic SERT anxiety effects were paradoxical in the context of the clinical use of SERT inhibitors to reduce anxiety.HighlightsMeta-analysis shows eight rodent anxiety factors have at least moderate effects.Publication bias affects four of the anxiety interventions.Preclinical rodent anxiety results appear disconnected from clinical efforts.Serotonin transporter gene lesion effects are paradoxical with reuptake inhibitors clinical use.",5520,911,3266,58.0

Rather than specifyng precise behaviors, sensory information - if at all present - interacts with ongoing neural activity to instruct the organism which type of spontaneous, exploratory behavior to generate. Evaluating the ensuing reafferent feedback modifies the nervous system such that ongoing neural activity patterns become biased towards activity that has generated increased appetitive and decreased aversive feedback in the past. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying both the exploratory, spontaneous behaviors as well as those underlying the modifications caused by the feedback are becoming increasingly understood, even on a molecular level. It is straightforward to hypothesize that the constant interaction between ongoing neural activity and the incoming sensory stream allows the organism to balance behavioral flexibility with efficiency to accomplish adaptive behavioral choice in an often unpredictably changing environment.",2590,632,890,26.0

Yet how to effectively analyse such behavioural data remains an open question. Here we explore whether a minimum description length principle can be exploited to identify meaningful behaviours and phenotypes. We apply a dictionary compression algorithm to behavioural sequences from the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans freely crawling on an agar plate both with and without food and during chemotaxis. We find that the motifs identified by the compression algorithm are rare but relevant for comparisons between worms in different environments, suggesting that hierarchical compression can be a useful step in behaviour analysis. We also use compressibility as a new quantitative phenotype and find that the behaviour of wild-isolated strains of C. elegans is more compressible than that of the laboratory strain N2 as well as the majority of mutant strains examined. Importantly, in distinction to more conventional phenotypes such as overall motor activity or aggregation behaviour, the increased compressibility of wild isolates is not explained by the loss of function of the gene npr-1, which suggests that erratic locomotion is a laboratory-derived trait with a novel genetic basis. Because hierarchical compression can be applied to any sequence, we anticipate that compressibility can offer insight into the organisation of behaviour in other animals including humans.",3051,226,1061,27.0

Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: (i) selecting an action among several alternatives, and (ii) choosing the response vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Previous works have addressed the computational substrates of such a selection process under the assumption that outcome values are stationary and do not change during the course of a session. This assumption does not hold when the motivational drive of the decision-maker is variable, because it leads to changes in the values of the outcomes, e.g., satiety decreases the value of the outcome. Here, we utilize an optimal control framework and derive the optimal choice and response vigor under different experimental conditions. The results imply that, in contrast to previous suggestions, even under conditions that the values of the outcomes are changing during the session, the optimal response rate in an instrumental conditioning experiment is a constant response rate rather than decreasing. Furthermore, we prove that the uncertainty of the decision-maker about the duration of the session explains the commonly observed decrease in response rates within a session. We also show that when the environment consists of multiple outcomes, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies. These results, therefore, provide a quantitative analysis of optimal choice and response vigor under variable motivational drive, and provide predictions for future testing.",1276,118,300,16.0

In addition, it would predict that the higher the relatedness value (R) between individuals, such as in clonal organisms, the more likely kin selection is to evolve. One benefit of kin selection is a reduction in aggression towards kininvarious social contexts, such as foraging. In the gynogenetic Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa, females have been shown to differentiate between clone types, preferring to associate with clonal sisters to non-sisters, and regulate their aggressive behaviors accordingly. We ask ifAmazon mollies in resource-limited environments: 1) still maintain the ability to regulate aggressive behaviors according to relatedness (heterospecific females, clonal sisters or non-sisters), and 2) how their aggressivebehaviors change relative to a female’s social partner? Using a repeated-measures design, we found that focal females regulated their aggressive behaviors depending on partner type (i.e., a heterospecific female, clonal sister, or non-sister). Heterospecific females and the non-sister clones spent more time behaving aggressively towards the focal females, and these females also received significantly more bites from heterospecific females. Interestingly, the clonal sisters, when compared to the other two female types, performed significantly more tail beats towards focal females.We are able to confirm that females do show more aggression towards heterospecific females and non-sister clones in a food-limited environment, andthat their aggression scales with relatedness (R).Lay Summary Kin recognition allows individuals to adjust costly behaviors, such as aggression, according to the degree of genetic relatedness. We show that in a food-limited environment, a clonal species of fish, the Amazon molly, females regulate aggressive behaviors depending on how closely related they are to the recipient female, behaving more aggressively to both heterospecific females and non-sister clones. The ability to regulate costly behaviors under variable socialconditions is advantageous, especially when resources are limited.",1417,128,322,23.0

We show that a clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), can distinguish between different clonal lineages, associating with genetically identical, sister clonals, and use multiple sensory modalities. Also, they scale their aggressive behaviors according to the relatedness to other females: they are more aggressive to non-related clones. Our results demonstrate that even in species with very small genetic differences between individuals, kin recognition can be adaptive. Their discriminatory abilities and regulation of costly behaviors provides a powerful example of natural selection in species with limited genetic diversity.",1385,144,400,31.0

However, inferences on behaviour and sociality have been far less frequent. Here, we investigate the complete mitochondrial genomes of extinct Late Pleistocene cave bears and middle Holocene brown bears that each inhabited multiple geographically proximate caves in northern Spain. In cave bears, we find that, although most caves were occupied simultaneously, each cave almost exclusively contains a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes. This remarkable pattern suggests extreme fidelity to their birth site in cave bears, best described as homing behaviour, and that cave bears formed stable maternal social groups at least for hibernation. In contrast, brown bears do not show any strong association of mitochondrial lineage and cave, suggesting that these two closely related species differed in aspects of their behaviour and sociality. This difference is likely to have contributed to cave bear extinction, which occurred at a time in which competition for caves between bears and humans was likely intense and the ability to rapidly colonise new hibernation sites would have been crucial for the survival of a species so dependent on caves for hibernation as cave bears. Our study demonstrates the potential of ancient DNA to uncover patterns of behaviour and sociality in ancient species and populations, even those that went extinct many tens of thousands of years ago.",3233,200,1197,33.0

Rhesus macaque subjects and human participants performed a TI task in which, prior to learning a seven-item list ABCDEFG, a block of trials presented exclusively the pair FG. Contrary to the expectation of associative models, the high prior rate of reward for F did not disrupt learning of the entire list. Monkeys (who each completed many sessions) learned to anticipate that novel stimuli should be preferred over F. We interpret this as evidence of a general task representation of TI that generalizes beyond learning about specific stimuli. Humans (who were task-naïve) showed a transitory bias to F when it was paired with novel stimuli, but very rapidly unlearned that bias. Performance with respect to the remaining stimuli was consistent with past reports of TI in both species. These results are difficult to reconcile with any account that seeks to assign the strength of association between individual stimuli and rewards.

Decety, Peggy Mason",044180;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/044180,"Despite decades of research with humans, the biological mechanisms that motivate an individual to help others remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality.To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats received midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, and tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping.The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats’ subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior.Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rat’s behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate.In sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.",3199,247,1144,48.0

However, it remains unclear if other methods can achieve a more compact representation or contribute further biological insight to worm locomotion. Here we take a data-driven approach to worm shape analysis using independent component analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a cosine series, and jPCA and confirm that the dimensionality of worm shape space is close to four. Projecting worm shapes onto the bases derived using each method gives interpretable features ranging from head movements to tail oscillation.

Here, we use a recently developed unsupervised technique to discover and track the occurrence of all stereotyped behaviors performed by fruit flies moving in a shallow arena.

We investigated the effect of motivation on mice performing a GO/NOGO visual discrimination task.

We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output to data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems.

Failure to regulate feeding may have devastating results, including obesity and diabetes, underscoring the importance of understanding its underlying mechanisms. The nematode C. elegans, whose food uptake consists of pumping bacteria from the environment into the gut, provides excellent opportunities for discovering principles of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Here we show that worms implement a graded feeding response to the concentration of environmental bacteria by modulating a commitment to bursts of fast pumping. Using long-term, high-resolution, longitudinal recordings of feeding dynamics under defined conditions, we find that the frequency and duration of pumping bursts increase and the duration of long pauses diminishes in environments richer in bacteria. The bioamine serotonin, a known feeding regulator in metazoa, is required for food-dependent induction of bursts as well as for maintaining their high rate of pumping through two distinct mechanisms. Following this phenotype quantitatively we identify the essential serotonergic neurons and the differential roles of distinct families of serotonin receptors. We propose that regulation of bursts is a conserved mechanism of behavior and motor control.",1664,139,614,29.0

We found that initiation of these actions is selectively encoded by two non-overlapping populations of OFC neurons, and that the relative size and differential pre-choice activity of the cocaine action-coding population determine an individual preference, a larger size and a higher pre-choice activity being associated with cocaine preference. A larger size is a structural feature that may confer to a population of OFC neurons a competitive advantage during choice in favor of the encoded action.

This explains why considerable research effort is being expended to try to develop anti-craving strategies for relapse prevention. Recently, we discovered using the classic reinstatement model of cocaine craving that the reinstating or priming effect of cocaine can be extinguished with repeated priming in rats - a phenomenon dubbed extinction of cocaine priming. Here we sought to measure the potential beneficial effect of this novel extinction strategy on subsequent relapse (i.e., return to the pre-extinction pattern of cocaine self-administration once the drug is made again available after extinction). Overall and contrary to our initial hope, extensive and complete extinction of cocaine priming had no major impact on relapse. This lack of effect occurred despite evidence for post-extinction loss of neuronal responses to cocaine priming in brain regions critically involved in cocaine-induced reinstatement (i.e., the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the core of the nucleus accumbens). An effect of extinction of cocaine priming on relapse was only observed when cocaine was available for self-administration under more demanding conditions. However, this effect was modest and short-lived. Finally, we succeeded to trace the origin of our failure to prevent relapse to a persistent, extinction-resistant form of operant behavior that is not directly induced by cocaine. This extinction-resistant behavior is commonly reported, though generally ignored as causally irrelevant, in many other reinstatement studies. We propose that this behavior should become both a novel marker for long-term vulnerability to relapse and a novel target for preclinical development of potential relapse prevention interventions.",1392,203,385,46.0

Despite such biases being a pervasive feature of human behavior, their underlying causes remain unclear. Many accounts of these biases appeal to limitations of human hypothesis testing and cognition, de facto evoking notions of bounded rationality, but neglect more basic aspects of behavioral control. Here we demonstrate involvement of Pavlovian approach biases in determining which information humans will choose to sample. We collected a large novel dataset from 32,445 human subjects, making over 3 million decisions, who played a gambling task designed to measure the latent causes and extent of information-sampling biases. We identified three novel approach-related biases, formalized by comparing subject behavior to a dynamic programming model of optimal information gathering. These biases reflected the amount of information sampled (‘positive evidence approach’), the selection of which information to sample (‘sampling the favorite’), and the interaction between information sampling and subsequent choices (‘rejecting unsampled options’). The prevalence of all three biases was related to a Pavlovian approach-avoid parameter quantified within an entirely independent economic decision task. Our large dataset also revealed that individual differences in information seeking are a stable trait across multiple gameplays, and can be related to demographic measures including age and educational attainment. As well as revealing limitations in cognitive processing, our findings suggest information sampling biases reflect the expression of primitive, yet potentially ecologically adaptive, behavioral repertoires. One such behavior is sampling from options that will eventually be chosen, even when other sources of information are more pertinent for guiding future action.",2864,180,673,35.0

Specifically in social insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories anchored globally to the nest or visual landmarks. Although existing computational models reproduced similar behaviors, they largely neglected evidence for possible neural substrates underlying the generated behavior. Therefore, we present here a model of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control - enabling vector navigation in embodied agents. The model consists of a path integration mechanism, reward-modulated global and local vector learning, random search, and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agent’s current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector memories and random exploration. In sim-ulation, we show that the neural mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic conditions. This provides an explanation for, how view-based navigational strategies are guided by path integration. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector learning and navigation in a simulated embodied agent linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.Author Summary Desert ants survive under harsh conditions by foraging for food in temperatures over 60° C. In this extreme environment, they cannot, like other ants, use pheromones to track their long-distance journeys back to their nests. Instead they apply a computation called path integration, which involves integrating skylight compass and odometric stimuli to estimate its current position. Path integration is not only used to return safely to their nests, but also helps in learning so-called vector memories. Such memories are sufficient to produce goal-directed and landmark-guided navigation in social insects. How can small insect brains generate such complex behaviors? Computational models are often useful for studying behavior and their underlying control mechanisms. Here we present a novel computational framework for the acquisition and expression of vector memories based on path integration. It consists of multiple neural networks and a reward-based learning rule, where vectors are represented by the activity patterns of circular arrays. Our model not only reproduces goal-directed navigation and route formation in a simulated agent, but also offers predictions about neural implementations. Taken together, we believe that it demonstrates the first complete model of vector-guided navigation linking observed behaviors of navigating social insects to their possible underlying neural mechanisms.",2703,380,889,28.0

Behavioural plasticity in response to internal or external cues can therefore generate potentially significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behaviour during foraging, and whether this behaviour is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined two measures of infection avoidance: (1) the motivation to feed in the presence of an infection risk and (2) the preference to feed on a clean food source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no clear evidence for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones, female flies were less motivated to feed when presented with a risk of encountering DCV, but only if they had been previously exposed to the virus.

A leading system for neurogenetic discovery is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster; fly memory research has identified genes and circuits that mediate aversive and appetitive learning. However, methods to study adaptive food-seeking behavior in this animal have lagged decades behind rodent feeding analysis, largely due to the challenges presented by their small scale. There is currently no method to dynamically control flies’ access to food. In rodents, protocols that use dynamic food delivery are a central element of experimental paradigms that date back to the influential work of Skinner. This method is still commonly used in the analysis of learning, memory, addiction, feeding, and many other subjects in experimental psychology. The difficulty of microscale food delivery means this is not a technique used in fly behavior. In the present manuscript we describe a microfluidic chip integrated with machine vision and automation to dynamically control defined liquid food presentations and sensory stimuli. Strikingly, repeated presentations of food at a fixed location produced improvements in path efficiency during food approach. This shows that improved path choice is a learned behavior. Active control of food availability using this microfluidic system is a valuable addition to the methods currently available for the analysis of learned feeding behavior in flies.",3103,179,1285,21.0

I found that grackles are behaviorally flexible and good problem solvers, they vary in behavioral flexibility across contexts, flexibility did not correlate with problem solving ability, and those that are more flexible did not necessarily use more learning strategies. It appears that behavioral flexibility can be an independent trait that varies across contexts. Maintaining such a high level of variation could be a mechanism underlying successful species invasions.

Here, we investigated whether this principle continues to hold when animals are concurrently trained in two types of tasks. Rats were trained on a plus maze in either a spatial navigation or a cue response task (individual training), while a third set of rats acquired both (concurrent training). Subsequently, the rats underwent either sham surgery or neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus (HPC), medial dorsal striatum (DSM) or lateral dorsal striatum (DSL), followed by retention testing. Finally, rats in the individual training condition also acquired the novel ‘other’ task. When rats learned one task, HPC and DSL selectively supported spatial navigation cue response, respectively. However, when rats learned both tasks, HPC and DSL additionally supported the behavior incongruent with the processing style of the corresponding memory system. DSM significantly contributed to performance regardless of task or training procedure. Experience with the cue response task facilitated subsequent spatial learning, while experience with spatial navigation delayed both simultaneous and subsequent response learning. These findings suggest that multiple principles govern the interactions among memory systems.Significance Statement Currently, we distinguish among several types of memories, each supported by a distinct neural circuit. The memory systems are thought to operate independently and in parallel. Here, we demonstrate that the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum memory systems indeed operate independently and in parallel when rats learn one type of task at a time, but interact co-operatively and in synergism when rats concurrently learn two types of tasks. Furthermore, new learning is modulated by past experiences. These results can be explained by a model in which independent and parallel information processing that occurs in the separate memory-related neural circuits is supplemented by information transfer between the memory systems at the level of the cortex.",2177,220,1180,28.0

We introduce a model-based analysis for temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taenopyggia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the next, and that “kernels” reflecting the temporal range of influence have a characteristic structure for a calling individual’s effect on itself, its partner, and on others in the group.

Communicating with sound has advantages, as signals propagate fast, omnidirectionally, around obstacles, and over long distances. Heterogeneous environments might favour multimodal communication, especially in socially complex species, as combination of modalities’ strengths helps overcome their individual limitations. Cichlid fishes are known to be vocal, but a recent report suggests that this is not the case for the socially complex Princess cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher from Lake Tanganyika. Here we further investigated acoustic communication in this species. Wild and captive N. pulcher produced high frequency sounds (mean: 12 kHz), when stimulated by mirror images. In laboratory experiments, N. pulcher produced distinct two-pulsed calls mostly, but not exclusively, associated with agonistic displays. Our results suggest that male N. pulcher produce more sounds at greater durations than females. Thus, we confirm that the Princess cichlid does not produce low frequency sounds, but does produce high frequency sounds, both in combination with and independent from visual displays, suggesting that sounds are not a by-product of displays. Further studies on the hearing abilities of N. pulcher are needed to clarify if the high-frequency sounds are used in intra-or inter-specific communication.",1852,237,760,28.0

The stimulation method hosts, though, several bias. Their compounded effects can explain a range of discrepancies between the reported electrophysiological recordings and significantly alter the current interpretation. To test the hypothesis that the bias may significantly alter our current understanding of the moth’s auditory transducer characteristics, papers using the same auditory stimulation method and reporting on either spiking threshold or spiking activity of the moth’s A cells were analysed. The consistency of the reported data was assessed. A range of corrections issued from best practices and theoretical background were applied to the data in an attempt to re-interpret the data. We found that it is not possible to apply a posteriori corrections to all data and bias. However the corrected data indicates that the A cell’s spiking may be (i) independent of the repetition rate, (ii) maximum when detecting the long and low intensity pulses of the bat in searching mode, and (iii) steadily reduce as the bat closes on the moth. These observations raise the possibility that a fixed action pattern drives the moths’s erratic evasive manoeuvres until the final moment. In depth investigation of the potential bias also suggest that the auditory transducer’s response may be constant for a larger frequency range than thought so far, and provide clues to explain the negative taxis in response to the searching bats’s calls detection.",1481,121,422,21.0

Especially the impressive aerial performance of insects relies on rapid and precise integration of multiple sensory modalities that provide feedback on different time scales. In flies, continuous visual signalling from the compound eyes is fused with phasic proprioceptive feedback to ensure precise neural activation of wing steering muscles within narrow temporal phase bands of the stroke cycle. This phase-locked activation relies on mechanoreceptors distributed over wings and gyroscopic halteres. Here we investigate visual steering performance of tethered flying fruit flies with reduced haltere and wing feedback signalling. Using a flight simulator, we evaluated visual object fixation behaviour, optomotor altitude control, and saccadic escape reflexes. The behavioural assays show an antagonistic effect of wing and haltere signalling on visuomotor gain during flight. Compared to controls, suppression of haltere feedback attenuates while suppression of wing feedback enhances the animal’s wing steering range. Our results suggest that the generation of motor commands owing to visual perception is dynamically controlled by proprioception. We outline a potential physiological mechanism based on the biomechanical properties of wing steering muscles and sensory integration processes at the level of motoneurons. Collectively, the findings contribute to our general understanding how moving animals integrate sensory information with dynamically changing temporal structure.",1418,103,384,14.0

We find that while the relationship between reward/aversion and attention is functionally invariant, a power law formulation akin to the Cobb-Douglas production function in economics provides the best model fit and theoretical explanation for the interaction. These results indicate that a decreasing signal-to-noise with signal detection results in higher loss aversion.

We use immobility as an origin and reference for the measurement of locomotor behavior; speed, direction of walking and direction of facing as the three degrees of freedom shaping fly locomotor behavior; and cocaine as the parameter inducing a progressive transition in and out of immobility. In this way we expose and quantify the generative rules that shape part of fruit fly locomotor behavior, bringing about a gradual buildup of freedom during the transition from immobility to normal behavior and a precisely opposite narrowing down during the transition into immobility. During buildup the fly exhibits enhancement and then reduction to normal values of movement along each degree of freedom: first, body rotation in the horizontal plane, then path curvature and then speed of translation. Transition into immobility unfolds by narrowing down of the repertoire in the opposite sequential order, showing reciprocal relations during both buildup and narrowing down. The same generative rules apply to vertebrate locomotor behavior in a variety of contexts involving transition out and into immobility. Recent claims for deep homology between the arthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia provide an opportunity to examine whether the generative rules we discovered also share common descent. Neurochemical processes mediating the buildup of locomotor behavior in vertebrates could guide the search for equivalent processes in arthropods. The measurement methodology we use prompts the discovery of candidate behavioral homologies.Significance Statement Do flies and mice share the same behavior? By defining immobility as an intrinsic reference point for locomotor behavior we show that the rules that generate the transition from immobility to full blown normal behavior, and from full blown behavior to immobility are shared by fruit flies and mice. These rules constitute a much desired aim of evolutionary biology: the discovery of behavioral homologies across distant phyla.

However, looming has not been analyzed in the context of collisions between two moving animals. We propose an alternative strategy, generalized regressive motion (GRM), which is consistent with recently observed behavior in fruit flies.

Despite emerging evidence that individual variation strongly affects group performance, it is less clear to what extent individual variation is modulated by participation in collective behaviour. We examined light avoidance (negative phototaxis) in the gregarious cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, in both solitary and group contexts. Cockroaches in groups exhibit idiosyncratic light-avoidance performance that persists across days, with some individual cockroaches avoiding a light stimulus 75% of the time, and others avoiding the light just above chance (i.e. ~50% of the time). These individual differences are robust to group composition. Surprisingly, these differences do not persist when individuals are tested in isolation, but return when testing is once again done with groups. During the solo testing phase cockroaches exhibited individually consistent light-avoidance tendencies, but these differences were uncorrelated with performance in any group context. Therefore, we have observed not only that individual variation affects group-level performance, but also that whether or not a task is performed collectively can have a significant, predictable effect on how an individual behaves. That individual behavioural variation is modulated by whether a task is performed collectively has major implications for understanding variation in behaviours that are facultatively social, and it is essential that ethologists consider social context when evaluating individual behavioural differences.Abbreviations: DLP: digital light processing; MP: megapixels; ANOVA: analysis of variance, ICC: intraclass correlation coefficient, CI: confidence interval.",1866,164,1260,16.0

Recent innovations in tracking technology have allowed researchers to collect large and highly accurate datasets on animal spatiotemporal position while vastly decreasing the time and cost of collecting such data. One technique that is of particular relevance to the study of behavioral ecology involves tracking visual tags that can be uniquely identified in separate images or movie frames. These tags can be located within images that are visually complex, making them particularly well suited for longitudinal studies of animal behavior and movement in naturalistic environments. While several software packages have been developed that use computer vision to identify visual tags, these software packages are either (a) not optimized for identification of single tags, which is generally of the most interest for biologist, or (b) suffer from licensing issues, and therefore their use in the study of animal behavior has been limited. Here, we present BEEtag, an open-source, image-based tracking system in Matlab that allows for unique identification of individual animals or anatomical markers. The primary advantages of this system are that it (a) independently identifies animals or marked points in each frame of a video, limiting error propagation, (b) performs well in images with complex background, and (c) is low-cost. To validate the use of this tracking system in animal behavior, we mark and track individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) and recover individual patterns of space use and activity within the hive.

A study of aggression in two groups of captive monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) found a transition to large-scale ordered aggression occurred in newly-formed groups after one week, with individuals thereafter preferring to direct aggression against those nearby in rank. We describe two mechanisms by which individuals may determine rank order: inference based on overall levels of aggression, or on subsets of the aggression network.

The mean intensity of a background is a key statistic, because it can be estimated across a large range of viewing distances by a simple computation. We investigated how the dynamic neuromuscular camouflage system of the cuttlefish Sepia offcinalis responds to changes in the mean background intensity of uniform backgrounds. We find that cuttlefish adapt their body intensity in response to variations in the mean background intensity, yet show biases in their body intensity beyond what can be predicted from the limited dynamic range of their camouflage system. On sandy backgrounds of various reflectance values their uniform body patterns maintain a constant yellow hue. This color constancy may represent an example of a color prior in a colorblind animal because a yellow body color would be the optimal hue for camouflage on sands typically encountered in their natural environment. Cuttlefish adapt their appearance to the background via a dynamic process composed of a complex mixture of intensity transients spanning timescales from the subsecond to the minute range. In very young animals camouflaging on dark sands the masquerade strategy is preferred over background matching. Masquerade is implemented by combining partial background matching with frequent expression of disruptive components. We furthermore provide an objective definition of disruptive components using hierarchical clustering and automated image analysis thus highlighting the role of chromatophore activity correlations in structuring the motor output of S.officinalis.",1762,188,733,16.0

Schwarz, Robyn Branicky, Laura J. Grundy, William R. Schafer, André E.X. Brown",017707;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/017707,"Locomotion is driven by shape changes coordinated by the nervous system through time; thus, enumerating an animal’s complete repertoire of shape transitions would provide a basis for a comprehensive understanding of locomotor behaviour. Here we introduce a discrete representation of behaviour in the nematode C. elegans. At each point in time, the worm’s posture is approximated by its closest matching template from a set of 90 postures and locomotion is represented as sequences of postures. The frequency distribution of postural sequences is heavy-tailed with a core of frequent behaviours and a much larger set of rarely used behaviours. Responses to optogenetic and environmental stimuli can be quantified as changes in postural syntax: worms show different preferences for different sequences of postures drawn from the same set of templates. A discrete representation of behaviour will enable the use of methods developed for other kinds of discrete data in bioinformatics and language processing to be harnessed for the study of behaviour.Author Summary Technology for recording neural activity is advancing rapidly and whole-brain imaging with single neuron resolution has already been demonstrated for smaller animals. To interpret such complex neural recordings, we need comprehensive characterizations of behaviour, which is the principal output of the brain. Animal tracking can increasingly be performed automatically but an outstanding challenge is finding ways to represent these behavioural data. We have focused on the movement of the nematode worm C. elegans to develop a quantitative representation of behaviour as a series of distinct postures. Each posture is analogous to a word in a language and so we can directly count the number of phrases that makes up the C. elegans behavioural repertoire. C. elegans has a very small nervous system but we find that its behavioural repertoire is still complex. As with human languages, there is a large number of possible phrases, but most are rarely used. When comparing different populations of worms or worms in different environments, we find that the difference between their behaviour is due to a subset of their entire repertoire. In the language analogy, these would correspond to idiomatic phrases that distinguish groups of speakers. A quantitative understanding of the nature of behavioural variation will inform research on the function and evolution of neural circuits.",2780,130,831,19.0

This approach requires many replicates with large population sizes, which imposes severe restrictions on the analysis of behavioral phenotypes. Aiming to use E&amp;R for investigating the evolution of behavior in Drosophila, we have developed a simple and effective method to assess spontaneous olfactory preferences and learning in large samples of fruit flies using a T-maze. We tested this procedure on (a) a large wild-caught population and (b) 11 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Compared to previous methods, this procedure reduces the environmental noise and allows for the analysis of large population samples. Consistent with previous results, we show that flies have a spontaneous preference for orange vs. apple odor. With our procedure wild-derived flies exhibit olfactory learning in the absence of previous laboratory selection. Furthermore, we find genetic differences in the olfactory learning with relatively high heritability. We propose this large-scale method as an effective tool for E&amp;R and genome-wide association studies on olfactory preferences and learning.",1744,244,533,26.0

Hover, Russell A. Poldrack",014316;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/014316,"Influencing choice behavior is key to achieving behavioral change. Traditional means to influence choice behavior rely on effortful self control, which is known to be fragile under several circumstances, rendering these methods ineffectual in maintaining any change in behavior over time. Behavioral maintenance efforts are likely more effective over the long term if they target more automatic processes such as attention or memory. Memories are not set in stone and are vulnerable to change and updating under certain circumstances when retrieved. It is possible to target specific memories for updating. In two studies, we sought to update the memory for an appetitive choice by way of reversal learning following retrieval of the targeted choice behavior. We found that targeting memories of a choice behavior for updating shortly after a reminder did not significantly attenuate the renewal of the targeted choice under extinction conditions. Possible explanations and suggested future directions are discussed.",2247,178,1059,14.0

Recently, consecutive studies on manual asymmetries in bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata [Mangalam et al., 2014a; Mangalam et al., 2014b] revealed both the functional and the adaptive significance of manual asymmetries respectively, and pointed towards the division of labor as being the general principle underlying the observed hand-usage patterns. We review the studies on manual asymmetries in capuchin monkeys, Cebus spp. and argue that the observed hand-usage patterns might reflect specialization of the two hands for accomplishing tasks that require different dexterity types (i.e., maneuvering in three dimensional space or physical strength). To this end, we do a step-by-step analysis of the various tasks used in the studies on manual asymmetries in capuchin monkeys, wherein we: (a) analyze the different manual tasks that have been used to study manual asymmetries in non-human primates on the basis of the attributes such as the number of hands required to solve a given task (i.e., unimanual, pseudo unimanual, or bimanual) and the spatiotemporal progression of manual actions (i.e., sequential or concurrent). (b) Determine the forms and functions of manual asymmetries that these tasks can potentially elicit within the broader scope of the behavioral repertoire of an individual, a population, or a species. (c) Qualify the scope of the inter-individual, -population, or -species comparisons. We then describe the division of labor as a general principle underlying manual asymmetries in non-human primates, and propose experimental designs that would elaborate the forms and functions of manual asymmetries in non-human primates, and the associated adaptive value.",1744,173,476,37.0

Accordingly, mouse models designed to study the mechanisms leading to these disorders are tested for this phenotypic trait. Test conditions vary between different models, and the effect of these test conditions on the quantity and quality of social interactions and ultrasonic communication is unknown. The present study examines to which extent the habituation time to the test cage as well as the shape / size of the cage influence social communication in freely interacting mice. We tested 8 pairs of male mice in free dyadic social interactions, with two habituation times (20 min and 30 min) and three cage formats (rectangle, round, square). We tested the effect of these conditions on the different types of social contacts, approach-escape sequences, follow behavior, and the time each animal spent in the vision field of the other one, as well as on the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations and their contexts of emission. We provide for the first time an integrated analysis of the social interaction behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations. Surprisingly, we did not highlight any significant effect of habituation time and cage shape / size on the behavioral events examined. There was only a slight increase of social interactions with the longer habituation time in the round cage. Remarkably, we also showed that vocalizations were emitted during specific behavioral sequences especially during close contact or approach behaviors. The present study provides a protocol reliably eliciting social contacts and ultrasonic vocalizations in male mice. This protocol is therefore well adapted for standardized investigation of social interactions in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders.",1802,138,629,25.0

Pitchers, Ian Dworkin",010330;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/010330,"Hunting mode, the distinct set of behavioural strategies that a predator employs while hunting, can be an important determinant of the prey organism’s behavioural response. However, few studies have considered how a predator’s hunting mode influences anti-predatory behaviours of a prey species. Here we document the influence of active hunters (zebra jumping spiders, Salticus scenicus) and ambush predators (Chinese praying mantids, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis) on the capture deterrence anti-predatory behavioural repertoire of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that D. melanogaster would reduce overall locomotory activity in the presence of ambush predators, and increase activity with active hunters. First we observed and described the behavioural repertoire of D. melanogaster in the presence of the predators. We documented three previously undescribed behaviours-abdominal lifting, stopping and retreat-which were performed at higher frequency by D. melanogaster in the presence of predators, and may aid in capture deterrence. Consistent with our predictions, we observed an increase in the overall activity of D. melanogaster in the presence of jumping spiders (active hunter). However, counter to our prediction, mantids (ambush hunter) had only a modest influence on activity. We also observed considerable intra and inter-individual variation in response to both predator types. Given these new insights into Drosophila behaviour, and with the genetic tools available, dissecting the molecular mechanisms of anti-predator behaviours may now be feasible in this system.",3306,322,1547,60.0

Hendriksma, Karmi L. Oxman, Sharoni Shafir",008516;,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/008516,"Honey bees are important pollinators, requiring floral pollen and nectar for nutrition. Nectar is rich in sugars, but contains additional nutrients, including amino acids (AAs). We tested the preferences of free-flying foragers between 20 AAs at 0.1% w/w in sucrose solutions in an artificial meadow. We found consistent preferences amongst AAs, with essential AAs preferred over nonessential AAs. The preference of foragers correlated negatively with AA induced deviations in pH values, as compared to the control. Next, we quantified tradeoffs between attractive and deterrent AAs at the expense of carbohydrates in nectar. Bees were attracted by phenylalanine, willing to give up 84 units sucrose for 1 unit AA. They were deterred by glycine, and adding 100 or more units of sucrose could resolve to offset 1 unit AA. In addition, we tested physiological effects of AA nutrition on forager homing performance. In a no-choice context, caged bees showed indifference to 0.1% proline, leucine, glycine or phenylanaline in sucrose solutions. Furthermore, flight tests gave no indication that AA nutrition affected flight capacity directly. In contrast, low carbohydrate nutrition reduced the performance of bees, with important methodological implications for homing studies that evaluate the effect of substances that may affect imbibition of sugar solution. In conclusion, low AA concentrations in nectar relative to pollen suggest a limited role in bee nutrition. Most of the 20 AAs evoked a neutral to a mild deterrent response in bees, thus it seems unlikely that bees respond to AAs in nectar as a cue to assess nutritional quality. Nonetheless, free choice behavior of foraging bees is influenced, for instance by phenylalanine and glycine. Thus, AAs in nectar may affect plant-pollinator interactions and thereby exhibit a selective pressure on the flora in the honey bee habitat.",1869,562,972,35.0

Evans, Sasha R.X.

Reflectance spectrometry has become a standard colour-measuring tool, especially after the discovery of tetrachromacy in birds and their ability to detect UV. Birds’ plumage patterns may be invisible to humans, necessitating a reliable and objective way of assessing colouration not dependent on human vision. Plumage colouration measurements can be taken directly on live birds in the field or in the lab (e.g. on collected feathers). Therefore, it is essential to determine which sampling method yields more repeatable and reliable measures, and which of the available quantitative approaches best assess the repeatability of these measures. Using a spectrophotometer, we measured melanin-based colouration in barn swallows’ (Hirundo rustica) plumage. We assessed the repeatability of measures obtained with both traditional sampling methods separately to quantitatively determine their reliability. We used the ANOVA-based method for calculating the repeatability of measurements from two years separately, and the GLMM-based method to calculate overall adjusted repeatabilities for both years. We repeated the assessment for the whole reflectance spectrum range and only the human-visible part, to assess the influence of the UV component on the reliabilities of sampling methodologies. Our results reveal very high repeatability for lab measurements and a lower, still moderate to high repeatability, for field measurements. Both increased when limited to only the human-visible part, for all plumage patches except the throat, where we observed the opposite trend. Repeatability between sampling methods was quite low including the whole spectrum, but moderate including only the human-visible part. Our results suggest higher reliability for measurements in the lab and higher power and accuracy of the GLMM-based method. They also suggest UV reflectance differences amongst different plumage patches.",2503,664,1642,29.0

Asymmetric movements of the wings were used from 1–8 dph to effect progressively more successful righting behaviour via body roll. Following 8 dph, wing motions transitioned to bilaterally symmetric flapping that yielded aerial righting via nose-down pitch, along with substantial increases in vertical force production during descent. Ontogenetically, the use of such wing motions to effect aerial righting precedes both symmetric flapping and a previously documented behaviour in chukar (i.e., wing-assisted incline running) hypothesized to be relevant to incipient flight evolution in birds. These findings highlight the importance of asymmetric wing activation and controlled aerial manoeuvres during bird development, and are potentially relevant to understanding the origins of avian flight.",1783,467,452,8.0
